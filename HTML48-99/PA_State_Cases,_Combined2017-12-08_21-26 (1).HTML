<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, Upper Merion Township, Pennsylvania, filed a motion for new trial after a verdict for defendant property owners in a bench trial on the property owners' action in assumpsit for money paid on an assessment against the property owners for construction of a curb.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Pennsylvania notified the Township that a highway running through the Township would be reconstructed and widened. The State highway department informed the Township's board of supervisors that it would construct a 40-foot cartway along the highway if the Township would pay for the curbs to be installed. The Township eventually agreed and assessed abutting landowners at a front footage rate under the Act of May 1, 1933, P.L. 103, &sect; 1402(b), 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66402(B) as amended. The property owners were assessed a certain amount as their share of the curbing. The property owners paid the money under protest and filed a complaint in assumpsit. The property owners contended that the assessment was improper because their property was not benefited from the curbing that ran along the rear of the property. Furthermore, the property owners had no access to the highway from their land. Two members of the Township board of supervisors testified that there was no special benefit to the property. The court held that without a special benefit, the assessment was invalid notwithstanding the lack of mention of special benefits to the property owners in the assessment statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the Township's motion for a new trial and also denied the Township's supplemental motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant home owners filed preliminary objections to a mechanic's lien claim and complaint filed by plaintiff construction company pursuant to the Mechanics' Lien Law of August 24, 1963, P. L. 1175 (Pennsylvania).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The construction company filed numerous mechanic's liens in connection with work it did on a housing development. The homeowners contended that their property was immune from the lien because the work performed did not constitute an improvement and was not incidental to the erection, construction, or repair of an improvement. Moreover, the homeowners argued that the lien was invalid because they had never been the owners of the property on which the work was performed. The court found that the mechanic's lien on the homeowners' property for the construction of a driveway, sidewalk, curb, storm and sanitary sewer and street appurtenant to their lot was valid because the work was incidental to the construction of an improvement within the meaning of the Mechanics' Lien Law of August 24, 1963. Further, the court found that construction company would have had a right to file a mechanic's lien prior to 1874, when a provision of the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1874 stating that the General Assembly was prohibited from creating or extending liens became effective. At the time the building was commenced and the lien attached, the street and pavement areas were still privately owned.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found the liens were valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a retired fireman, brought an action against defendant city pension fund board of managers in mandamus seeking the reinstatement of his pension. The city filed an answer and new matter. The fireman filed a demurrer to the answer and new matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fireman retired at 63 years of age, having been employed by the city for approximately 33 years. He retired for reasons of disability, for which he later received disability benefits. The city terminated his pension, citing new rules that deducted from a pension any disability benefits received. The court found that the fireman was governed by state law regarding his retirement age. Under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 39321 (1959), he was entitled to retire without regard to disability at any time after age 55, whereas the city attempted to allow that only after age 65. The court held that the city only had statutory authority to create the pension fund, not to change the eligibility requirements for pensions. Thus, the city had no right to control by ordinance the age and length of service requisite to the fireman's retirement. Instead, the rules adopted by the board of managers were applicable. They rendered the fireman eligible for voluntary retirement without reference to disability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the preliminary objections filed by the fireman. The court found that the fireman's pension could not be terminated or reduced by the amount received as disability benefits. Thus, the court decreed that the pension be restored.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff individual brought an action in trespass against defendants, a justice of the peace and a deputy constable. Plaintiff alleged that defendants violated her right to privacy by serving a warrant upon her at an unreasonable and improper hour after it was issued and that the warrant was employed for an unlawful purpose, to wit: to scare, frighten and alarm plaintiff. Defendants filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was involved in a matter of disorderly conduct. Using registered mail, defendant justice of the peace mailed a summons for a hearing to plaintiff. Three days later, he issued another summons for the same offense. That same day, defendants drove to plaintiff's home and served the second summons on plaintiff at about 12:55 A.M. Defendants' demurrer asserted privilege and contended that their actions were proper. Plaintiff argued that by proceeding to her home late at night to serve a second summons, defendants made her neighbors aware of her &quot;criminal status&quot; so as to violate her right of privacy. The court held that plaintiff did not have a right of privacy sufficient to prevent notoriety being given orally in the neighborhood of the fact of her arrest. The court found that, even though defendants went to plaintiff's home to serve a summons when one had already been mailed, such action was not inherently oppressive. The court also concluded that defendants' actions were not so beyond the pale of their authority that they were not protected by judicial privilege. As a result, the court determined that plaintiff failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation's capital stock was resettled by the Department of Revenue pursuant to &sect; 1105 of the Fiscal Code, Act of April 9, 1929, P. L. 343, as amended, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 1105, and approved by the Department of the Auditor General. The Board refused the corporation's petition for review and upheld the order. Upon further appeal, the court dismissed the appeal. The court held that the corporation's production of coffee and tea concentrates and coffee tapes did not constitute either manufacturing or processing under the Act of June 1, 1889, P. L. 420, &sect; 21(a), as amended by the Act of March 15, 1956, P. L. (1955) 1285, and the Act of August 23, 1961, P. L. 1100, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 1871. The corporation's production of coffee products did not constitute manufacturing because the process that the coffee beans underwent was a mere chemical change. The corporation's production of coffee products did not constitute processing because the coffee bean was not considered a fruit nor was the corporation's final product a bottled beverage. Therefore, the corporation was not exempt from the payment of capital stock on such activities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was summarily convicted by a justice of the peace (Pennsylvania) of engaging in the business of selling or otherwise dealing on Sunday in fresh meats, produce, or groceries in violation of &sect; 699.15 of the Pennsylvania Penal Code of June 24, 1939, P.L. 872, as added by the Act of September 27, 1961, P.L. 1695, Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a local manager for a regional grocer. Defendant was present when store employees made Sunday sales to several customers. Defendant had opened the store on Sundays at the direction of his superiors, corporate management. Defendant was paid a flat salary and did not benefit from the Sunday openings. On appeal of his convictions, defendant contended that the Act was unconstitutional because it discriminated against larger stores by not applying to stores with fewer than 10 persons. He also contended that the statute was vague and that the transactions at issue fell within the &quot;preparation&quot; exception to the Act. In reversing the convictions, the court did not pass upon the constitutionality of the Act. Instead, it found that the portion of the law that excepted businesses which &quot;prepared&quot; food for human consumption from the reach of the Act applied to the store. The store baked, cooked, and prepared deli food for customers. It did not matter that the actual items sold on Sunday were not items prepared by store employees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court was a complaint in mandamus filed by plaintiffs, potential candidates for public office of an independent political party at an upcoming general election. Plaintiffs sought an order of the court directing defendant, the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, to accept and file their nomination papers and to certify their names as candidates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nomination papers had been rejected by defendants as not having the requisite number of signatures required by law. The court first noted that there was a difference between the less familiar election process related to nominees for public office by political bodies and the more familiar process relating to nominations by political parties. Political bodies and political parties were not the same. Section 951 of the Pennsylvania Election Code, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 25, &sect; 2911, provided for nominations by political bodies. The authority to use multiple-candidate nomination papers such as those used by plaintiffs was peculiar to nominations by political bodies; there were no comparable provisions found pertaining to nominations by political parties. The court found that it could not agree with defendants' argument that candidates named in a multiple-candidate nomination paper had to not only be limited to those filing in the same filing office and be exclusively state-wide or exclusively district candidates, but also that the candidates had to obtain the same number of qualifying signatures for their respective offices.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating the Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, &sect; 651, after he allowed a poolroom to be open on a Sunday. He was a stockholder in the poolroom. He was convicted of the offense by the justice of the peace. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's argument that he was wrongfully convicted under Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, &sect; 651, because he was a stockholder and not a licensed keeper, proprietor, owner, or superintendent of the poolroom. A stockholder was in every sense a proprietor or owner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a company organized by the Pennsylvania Act of May 12, 1871, P. L. 787, challenged a decision of the Board of Finance and Revenue of appellee, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which refused the company's petition for review and sustained an action taken by the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue in imposing a bank shares tax under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect;&sect; 1931, 1991 on the company's capital stock for the calendar year 1959.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company engaged in three classes of business: investments, real estate, and receiving deposits and making secured loans. Up to and including 1959, the company filed shares tax reports and paid the bank shares tax. In 1961, the company complied with &sect; 801 of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 2852-801. Under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 2852-3, the company was no longer subject to the shares tax imposed on banks and trust companies and was subsequently taxed as a business corporation. In the instant action, the company contended that it should never have been required to pay the shares tax because it was not the type of institution contemplated by Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect;&sect; 1931, 1991 and that it should have been taxed as a business corporation, not as a bank. The court agreed, finding that the company, although it did perform limited banking activities, was neither a banking and savings institution within the purview of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 1931, nor a company organized as a bank and trust company, nor a trust company within the purview of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 1991. Thus, the company was not subject to the tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered judgment for the company and directed that the Department of Revenue and the Department of the Auditor General to resettle the tax accordingly.</SPAN></P>

L. 58, &sect; 831) of the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code of April 29, 1959, waived a hearing before a justice of the peace (Pennsylvania) and evidence was presented showing that chicken feathers had escaped from the trailer in which defendant was transporting live chickens.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the blowing of chicken feathers off the live chickens was unavoidable and could not be prevented. The court determined from the testimony that the blowing feathers, even in the large quantities which a trooper had observed, were not in any way hazardous, or did they in any way injure the road surface. The court determined to the contrary, from the testimony that it might have been concluded that for a rural area the feathers were beneficial as fertilizer and that the feathers did not remain on the road so as to detract from appearance and thus injure Pennsylvania's growing tourist business. The court held that the blowing of feathers from live poultry was not a dropping, sifting, or leaking and that the term &quot;otherwise escaping&quot; in &sect; 831 (1959 P. L. 58, &sect; 831) of the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code of April 29, 1959, was too broad to include the unpreventable escape of feathers. The court also held that the feathers of chickens were not the main &quot;contents&quot; of defendant's truck and were, therefore, not in the purview of &sect; 831.</SPAN></P>

The initial plan was accepted by the board on several conditions, including that final approval would not issue until the board was satisfied that public water and sanitary sewer systems would be available to the tract. The board subsequently refused to approve the developer's final plan on the ground that sewer services were not available. In upholding the board's refusal, the court rejected the developer's assertion that the decision was arbitrary, unreasonable, and unconstitutional. Instead, noting that the board had the power, but not the obligation, to establish and construct a system of sewers and drainage, the court concluded that it had no authority to require the board to approve a subdivision plan without sewers when such a plan could be detrimental to the health and welfare of the community. Thus, the court found no abuse of the board's discretion and declined to say that the refusal was not in the best interests of all of the township's residents.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 65402. Intervenor, an elector of the township, moved to dismiss the petition on constitutional grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition alleged that the township had a population in excess of 10,000 persons and requested a decree ordering the election of two additional supervisors. The Act of July 13, 1961 provided that a court of quarter sessions, upon petition, &quot;may provide&quot; for the election of two additional supervisors. In his motion to dismiss the petition, intervenor alleged that the Act of July 13, 1961 was unconstitutional because it gave unguided discretion to the court and, thus, amounted to a delegation of legislative authority to the judiciary. Petitioners alleged that the Act of July 13, 1961 was valid because its provisions were mandatory and, thus, did not constitute permissive power. In refusing the motion to dismiss, the court held that the provisions of the Act of July 13, 1961 were not mandatory; the Pennsylvania legislature could not have intended a petition signed by only five percent of a township's electors to be absolutely determinative. The court held that the Act of July 13, 1961 lawfully conferred discretionary power upon the court; statutes authorizing a court of quarter sessions to deal with municipal affairs did not need to set for the intended standards in precise detail.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A corporate fiduciary and an individual court-appointed trustee of a testamentary trust dating back to 1914 filed their fifth account which contained a credit against principal of $ 10,000 as corporate trustee's compensation. The trust was to continue until 1985. The guardian and trustee ad litem objected to this item as an interim commission on principal. The auditing judge disallowed the credit. The trustee filed exceptions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the trust at issue came into being in 1914, Pennsylvania law did not allow interim commissions on principal. Thereafter, the Act of May 1, 1953, 1953 Pa. Laws 190, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 20, &sect; 3274 et seq., permitted the payment of interim commissions to a trustee out of principal. At issue was whether the Act was constitutional so as to permit the payment of the interim commission here. The court upheld the decision of the auditing judge disallowing the credit. The court noted that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had ruled that the Act of 1953 was unconstitutional with respect to estates created prior to its enactment so far as it concerned the payment of principal commissions to trustees who had received commissions as executors. The court concluded that the Act was also unconstitutional as to the payment of interim commissions. While the result might be that trustees in pre-1953 trust estates would not be fully or adequately compensated under this dispensation, the fact remained that they continued to be bound by the law in effect at the inception of the trust. They could not legally receive compensation not contemplated for them when they took up their duties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the trustee's exceptions and confirmed the adjudication absolutely.</SPAN></P>

The issues were whether &sect; 8(11) of the Pharmacy Act of 1961 was unconstitutional and whether there was sufficient evidence to prove that the items advertised were within the purview of the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A citation charged the pharmacist with two violations under the Pharmacy Act of September 27, 1961, P. L. 1700, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 63, &sect; 390. The court noted that the statute prohibited advertising prescription drugs, but the citation was for advertising dangerous drugs and/or narcotics. The court opined that although it would be in the public interest to obtain prescriptions at as cheap a price as possible, the advantages of free enterprise in the field could be too high a price to pay where protection of the public was involved, creating an atmosphere of easy availability. However, the court found that no evidence whatsoever was presented from which the Board could have concluded that the items advertised were dangerous drugs or narcotics within the meaning of the Act. The court concluded that the items advertised were brand names and that it was necessary for the Commonwealth to prove the composition and contents of the items or to have the Board take official notice of them. The court decided that the Board may not have considered the specific meaning and composition of dangerous drugs or narcotics in finding that the advertisement was improper.</SPAN></P>

After hearings, the Commission ordered the district to desist from assigning teachers of certain races to certain schools and ordered the district to desegregate schools. The court dismissed the appeal in part and sustained it in part. The Commission had the power under the Act to act as the complainant. The legislature did not give the Commission the power to deal with racial imbalance or de facto segregation in the public schools. The Commission's findings in support of its conclusion that the district was in violation of the Act's provisions prohibiting discrimination against pupils by reason of race were not supported by substantial evidence.

The court denied the business' petition for an appeal from the judgment given by the Alderman. The city filed a complaint in assumpsit to which the business filed an answer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business argued that the tax levied against it was unconstitutional and therefore it should not have been required to pay it. On review, the court agreed in part. It determined that the ordinance was partially void. It further noted that the ordinance itself provided that if any part of it was found to be void, the remaining part of it would continue to stand. The court interpreted this as the framers intent that the ordinance would not be found void in total, but that any void portion would be omitted. The court noted that if a tax was levied on an occupational privilege, it must have applied to all who shared the privilege. Part of the class could not have been excused, regardless of the motive behind the action. The effect and result of the regulations in question was that the tax was not imposed on all individuals enjoying an occupation within the city. It was clearly imposed only on those earning more than $ 800 a year and on those over the age of 18. This was void under Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subscribers filed a quo warranto action to dissolve an association on the ground that the Blue Shield Regulatory Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 2851-1501 (1939), as amended, under which the association was operated, was unconstitutional and void. The subscribers claimed that the Act was void insofar as it operated to exclude podiatrists and podiatry services from the association plan. The association demurred to the complaint. The court held that the exclusion was based upon a reasonable classification related to the difference in the scope of practice by podiatrists and other doctors, it was not arbitrary or unconstitutional. The court also held that the complaint failed to set forth a cause of action in that: (1) the Act met all constitutional requirements, and (2) the complaint lacked the requisite allegations indicating that the subscribers had an interest in the complete forfeiture of association's charter and the distribution of all its assets, which was so different and distinct from the interests of the members of the general public in such matters that the subscribers were entitled to bring this suit in their own names, and not on the relation of the attorney general.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs contended that the act was unconstitutional and void because it tended to lessen and eliminate the competitive practice of podiatrists in relation to those services they performed for the care of the human foot in common with doctors of medicine and of osteopathy. They contended further that defendants had individually and collectively combined and conspired, intentionally and maliciously, to interfere with legislation which would permit podiatrists to register as doctors under a certain insurance plan. Plaintiffs accordingly requested the court to restrain defendants from engaging in and continuing their unlawful and malicious conspiracy and asked for damages. The court sustained defendants' demurrer. The court held that the act was constitutional and that the type of activity complained of by plaintiffs was exactly that kind of activity which was most essential to the maintenance of a free society, namely, the right to petition the legislature. The court held further that this was one of the rights guaranteed in Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant brought petitions to quash an indictment and, in the alternative, to suppress certain oral and written statements of defendant, and to suppress certain items of physical evidence. Defendant was charged with murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A body was found on the fourth floor roof of a hotel, directly below defendant's ninth floor room. The window in defendant's room was broken, with portions of a venetian blind protruding therefrom. The court rejected defendant's contention that his constitutional right of privacy was violated by an illegal police search of his hotel room. The court held that the circumstances were so unusual that the police had a right to enter the room without a search warrant. Defendant further contended that a written statement obtained after his attorney had called police and not been allowed to talk to defendant, should have been suppressed. Police officers did not inform defendant that his attorney had called. The court concluded that the failure to inform defendant of the call was fatal to the Commonwealth's contention that there was an intelligent and understanding waiver of counsel. Even if defendant had the volition to waive the right of counsel at this time, he did not possess the capability to do it, because this crucial fact was known to the detectives, but unknown to him. Without this knowledge, there was neither the intelligence nor the understanding that a waiver required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion to quash the indictment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former husband and defendant former wife filed exceptions to the trustee's report relating to the sale of entireties' property and the proposed distribution of the proceeds. The parties purchased real property, then divorced, with the husband continuing to live in the home and receiving rents until the property was sold at public sale. Both parties argued that the proposed distribution was against the weight of the law and the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife argued that the trustee lacked the authority to divide the rental proceeds between the parties. Both parties objected to the distribution to the bank. The trial court did not have a hearing, prior to the sale of the property, to determine its value by the testimony of two impartial witnesses, as required by the Act of May 10, 1927, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, &sect;&sect; 501, 502. The equity court had no jurisdiction to hear suits for the division of accrued rents on property held by divorced spouses. Here, an accounting and the sale of the property were sought. The court found that any division of rents was based upon the rents actually received from the property. The court did not include the rents prior to the date of divorce. The wife volunteered to pay taxes and was not entitled to recover from the husband. The husband had a right to the wife's share of the rents, but the husband's share was subject to the deduction for her share of the expenses. The wife was liable for the joint mortgage loan, but not for the home improvement loan that the husband secured after the divorce. The court approved the expense amounts and the distribution of the balance to the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined the amount that the wife owned to the husband for her share of the expenses. The court reduced the husband's debt to the wife by the amounts paid on the liens. The court dismissed the wife's objection to the payment to the bank. The court ordered payment to the court reporters, payments for water and real estate taxes, additional trustee fees, and payments to the bank.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, citing the Pennsylvania Bituminous Coal Mine Act of July 17, 1961, P. L. 659, &sect;&sect; 226, 228, 242(d), filed a motion to quash an indictment charging him with violations of the Act in an incident involving a mine explosion in which it was alleged that defendant failed to make entries in his assistant mine foremen report book and in his mine examiner's record book of the discovery of an accumulation of explosive gas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth contended that the presence of gas was an &quot;unusual occurrence.&quot; Defendant argued that the presence of gas alone was a usual occurrence. The court quashed the indictment. The court noted that it had been stipulated that defendant had not detected any accumulation of gas on his mine examiner examination and could not be charged in that capacity. The court observed that the presence of gas in a gassy mine did not constitute a violation of law and that the Act contemplated the finding of gas and set forth provisions on its removal. The court stated that the presence and subsequent elimination of methane gas from a gassy mine did not constitute an unusual occurrence such as would require notation by a mine foreman. The court noted that the expression &quot;unusual occurrence&quot; in the Pennsylvania Bituminous Coal Mine Act of July 17, 1961, P.L. 659, &sect; 226 was so vague that great differences could arise in its application to factual situations. The court felt that a holding that the conduct charged constituted a crime would render &sect; 226 unconstitutional because the phrase &quot;unusual occurrence&quot; failed to give an assistant mine foreman adequate notice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the indictment charging defendant with failing to make proper notations in his mine examiner's and assistant mine foreman's record and report books.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the court was whether the contractor was entitled to file a mechanic's lien for the labor and materials furnished in constructing the parking lot in question. The court held that the contractor was entitled to file a lien for the labor and material furnished in constructing the parking lot, since it was an essential and integral part of the construction of the restaurant itself. The court held that there was no merit in the contention that the Mechanic's Lien Act of 1901 was unconstitutional if a mechanic's lien was permitted for the construction of a parking lot. The court held that since labor and materials for construction of a pavement were proper subjects of a mechanic's lien prior to the adoption of the Constitution in 1874, so also would have been the labor and materials for construction of a parking lot, so long as its construction was an integral part of the construction of the main improvement, such as the restaurant in the instant case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners bought a large tract of land. Previous owners had developed plans for subdividing the land into 71 lots. The Commonwealth notified the property owners by letter that the land was to be affected by two proposed highways. Under &sect; 219 of the State Highway Law, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 670.219, the owners were prohibited from making use of the area within the proposed highway's limits although no condemnation had taken place. Further, the project was not final. The property owners sought the appointment of viewers to appraise the value of their property taken, and the Commonwealth claimed that no taking had occurred. The Commonwealth sought the dismissal of the petition. The court denied the Commonwealth's objections. The court held that it was completely unrealistic to say that the property rights of the property owners were not adversely affected by the proceedings. The rights of the property owners to the free use and enjoyment of their property was materially abridged, as was the power of disposition at the will of the owners, and they were entitled to compensation assuming they were able to establish their loss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to his dismissal, the employee was a business manager at a state hospital for the department of health. The employee's position was a merit system position under The Pennsylvania Admin. Code of 1929 &sect; 2111(c). In 1963, the state legislature enacted the Civil Service Act of August 5, 1941 (Act), Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 741.1 et seq., bringing thousands of state employees within the coverage of the legislative civil service. The employee was notified by the department that his position had been placed in the &quot;unclassified service.&quot; The employee was later terminated without reason. The employee appealed the termination to the Commission. The Commission found that the employee had no right to a hearing because his position was in the unclassified service and that the Commission had no jurisdiction regarding the placement of his position as unclassified. The employee filed an unsuccessful equity action requesting a preliminary injunction; the employee thereafter filed the instant mandamus action. The court held that the Commission was required to grant the employee a hearing to determine whether the employee's position was classified or not under &sect; 951(a) of the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant barber was fined for operating his barbershop in violation of Beaver Falls, Pa., Ordinance 805, &sect; X, which limited the hours during which barber shops were allowed to operate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the barber argued that Beaver Falls, Pa., Ordinance 805, &sect; X was unconstitutional. The court agreed because there was no reasonable relation between the avowed purpose of the ordinance and the hours during which the shop was allowed to remain open. The likely true purpose of the ordinance was to compel the recalcitrant barber to conform to the hours desired by other barbers, which was not an object that could be accomplished constitutionally by the ordinance. The number of hours that a barber shop was open had no direct relation to the public health or safety and affected neither. No relation was established by the fact that inspection was necessary to enforce sanitary regulations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The township enacted ordinance which made provision for a general recreation plan and superimposed upon it all the land and appurtenances of the golf club, labeling it a recreation area. Among other statements, the golf club averred that this action by the township constituted an encumbrance on its property and was a cloud upon its title and will impaired and interfered with the sale or use of development by it of the aforesaid real estate. The prayer asked that the ordinance and enabling statute be declared null and void, and that the golf club be granted such equitable relief as may be proper. The township demurred on the grounds that the complaint failed to set forth a sufficient basis for attacking the ordinance. The court dismissed the township's preliminary objections, holding that the complaint set forth a sufficient basis for attacking the ordinance. On the merits, the court granted the golf club's requested relief, holding that the ordinance was null and void. The ordinance deprived the golf club of the lawful use of its property for three years without any compensation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trust was created in 1925 by the residuary clause in the testator's will. The principal was to be distributed at the expiration of 21 years after the death of all his descendants who survived the testator. He expressly directed that all stock dividends were to be treated as principal and not income. A partial account was filed regarding dividends of six percent or less that the trustees received between December 28, 1960 and June 19, 1963. The auditing judge awarded them to the income beneficiaries, and the guardian excepted. The court held that, while the Pennsylvania Rule of Apportionment was law, a settlor's direction in a pre-1939 trust, such as the testator's, violated the statute against accumulations, 1853 Pa. Law 503, &sect; 9 (act), because a stock dividend constituted income under the Rule. Further, the testator directed accumulations in excess of the period prescribed in the act. Thus, &sect; 2 of the Uniform Principal and Income Act was inapplicable because the testator's direction was &quot;contrary to law.&quot; Finally, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided that these small stock dividends should be awarded to income beneficiaries despite a testator's direction to the contrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Eminent Domain Code required that a judge was to accompany the jury to view the property that was to be condemned. Parties usually waived the requirement, but they refused to do so in the case before the court. Both parties sought to enforce the requirement of the Code. In denying the motion, the court ruled that insofar as it made the taking of a view by the judge mandatory, para. 1, &sect; 703, of the Pennsylvania Eminent Domain Code of 1964 was an unwarranted, unreasonable, and burdensome interference with judicial prerogative. Thus, the court declared that the provision was unconstitutional. The court found that the provision improperly deprived the judiciary of its constitutional prerogative to determine the relevancy, probative value, and admissibility of items of evidence, unduly burdened and interfered with the just, speedy, and inexpensive administration of judicial proceedings, and conflicted with Pa. R. Civ. P. 219, as adopted by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

The insurer filed preliminary objections, by demurrer, in which it sought a dismissal of the action. The court sustained the preliminary objections and dismissed the complaint, holding that the insurer was entitled to claim the immunity from common law claims given to employers under &sect; 303 of the Act because the insurer was the alter ego of the employer. After examining a prior erroneous ruling by a federal court, the court held that a workmen's compensation carrier had been given the status of the employer and was not subject to suit as a &quot;third party.&quot; This finding was buttressed by the subrogation provisions of article IV of the Act. In addition, the insurer had no liability under a provision in the policy pertaining to a safety survey by the insurer because that provision dealt only with the fixing of rates of insurance and not safety regulations.</SPAN></P>

The owners argued that the assessment ordinance was applied in a discriminatory manner against them as a class of property owners, and therefore it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city ordinance required rooming houses and hotels to install but one water meter per building to pay the water rent and the city, in turn imposed a sewer rental according to the water rent. The owners of apartment buildings argued that their buildings should be assessed the same as a hotel or rooming house, with only one water meter. The city argued that each apartment unit was to have its own water meter and pay accordingly. The court held that the Act of May 4, 1927, P. L. 519, &sect; 2170, as amended, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 47170 et seq., required the ordinance to equitably distribute the annual apportionment among the same class of property owners. If the ordinance discriminated against apartment houses in favor of rooming houses when they were both of the same class to the owner's financial detriment, the assessment was illegal and unconstitutional. However, the court held that is saw insufficient proof of discrimination; the city had not abused its discretion in regarding each apartment as a single-dwelling unit for sewage rental purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lots at issue were sold at a county treasurer's tax sale. The heir sought cancellation of the purchasers' deed. The purchasers argued that equity should not take jurisdiction because the heir had an adequate remedy at law. The court concluded that it had jurisdiction of the matter because equity suits seeking cancellation and reconveyance of tax titles resulting from unlawful tax sales were proper. Under &sect; 7 of the Law, before there might be a valid sale of property for unpaid taxes, notice first had to be given to the owner. Where a county treasurer served notice upon a predecessor in title rather than upon the present owner, a sale was invalid. A duty was placed upon the tax assessor to investigate public records to find the true owner of assessed property. Notice of the sale was not sent or delivered to the heir at her last known address, known by the tax collector for at least three years and which should have been known by the county treasurer and tax assessor. A letter sent to the lots' address was returned &quot;unknown,&quot; thereby alerting the authorities that the owner received no notice and suggesting that they investigate to see if their records revealed the right owner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator applied for a writ of habeas corpus, challenging his conviction for vagrancy, a violation of the Vagrancy Act of May 8, 1876, P.L. 154 (Pennsylvania), Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator was arrested and charged with larceny. In the course of the proceeding, a charge of vagrancy was added. When the prosecuting witness refused to press the larceny charge, that charge was dismissed, and the case proceeded on the vagrancy charge. A magistrate adjudged relator guilty of vagrancy and committed him to a workhouse for the maximum term of six months. The court stated that in order to be a vagrant, an accused had to be a nonresident, a beggar, or a loiterer. None of these essential requirements applied to relator. There was no evidence whatever under which relator could be convicted of vagrancy. Furthermore, the refusal of police officers to let relator make telephone calls and an immediate hearing without counsel violated relator's rights under Pa. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent died leaving a will in which he named his brother, his widow, and a trust company as executors and trustees. On the audit of their account as executors they received commissions on principal and income. During the term of the trust additional commissions on income were paid to the trustees. The brother died. At the audit of the widow's estate, the remaining institutional trustee asked for additional commissions on principal based on its published fee schedule. An auditing judge awarded additional commissions to the trustee. The remainderman excepted to the award. The court held that: (1) the standard schedule was not in effect so far as the trust was concerned where there was no agreement with the decedent concerning the trustee's compensation and no testimony as to overhead and other costs or unusual services rendered; and (2) where the trust estate had been accepted by the trustee prior to the repeal of a law prohibiting double commissions, the trustee was precluded from requesting a second commission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A proviso to the Act added that articles V and VII, which dealt with procedure and evidence, applied to condemnations effective prior to the date of approval. The court noted that because no reference was made to article VI in the proviso, some would have argued that article VI applied to condemnations before the Act. However, the court held that this was not so because the mention of a specific matter in a general statute implied the exclusion of others not mentioned. Two exceptions were mentioned, and a proper assumption was that no others were intended by the Legislature. The court further held that Article VI did not apply to prior condemnations because &sect; 56 of the Statutory Construction Act, 1937, P. L. 1019, art. IV, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 46, &sect; 556 and case law provided that no law could be construed to be retroactive unless clearly and manifestly so intended by the Legislature. Also, because under Article VI the authority could have been required to pay additional damages, its application would have been unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurance company challenged appellee Commonwealth's settlement against it of the Pennsylvania Gross Premiums Tax under the Act of February 21, 1961, P. L. 33, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 2270.1 et seq. (1961). In a case of first impression, the issue was whether domestic life insurance companies could be classified separately from all other types of domestic insurance companies for purposes of taxation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance company questioned the constitutionality of the Gross Premiums Tax Act, contending that it violated due process and equal protection guarantees of both the Federal and State Constitutions and the tax uniformity clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The insurance company insisted that only premiums received during the year on new policies could be taxed that year. The court observed that the insurance company did not show a lack of proper classification, and it rejected the argument that it was unjustly discriminatory to tax premiums from health and accident policies by domestic life insurance companies while not taxing premiums arising out of identical policies by other types of domestic insurance companies. The court pointed out that the test was whether the tax was placed indiscriminately on every member of a class. The court found that every domestic life insurance company deriving premiums from health and accident business was taxed at the same rate on those premiums, so the tax was within the constitutional limitations for equal protection and tax uniformity. The court concluded it was proper to include renewal premiums in the taxable premiums to be reported.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the insurance company's appeal and sustained the action of the Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon consideration of the complaint and the testimony adduced at the time of the hearing on the preliminary injunction, the court determined that neither the bylaws nor the constitution of the corporation permitted the solicitation or voting by proxy on the question of the proposed merger. The court further found that the solicitation and intended use of votes by proxy at the meeting was invalid and contrary to the statutes and law of Pennsylvania. The court granted the preliminary injunction, holding that because 1933 Pa.

The coroner inserted &quot;Accident.&quot; However, in another part of the certificate, the coroner responded &quot;Unknown&quot; to a question regarding how the injury occurred. The court concluded that no one knew how the insured met his death other than that he died by drowning and that the label &quot;Accident&quot; was inserted without factual foundation. When, as a consequence of its introduction into evidence, a certificate was considered and used by the finders of fact as substantive evidence, there was trial error. The certificate was obviously contradictory in its terms and should not have been received. The insurance company's motion for judgment n.o.v. was discharged and the motion was dismissed.

The light commercial zone did not allow gas stations. The building inspector denied the application and the Board sustained the building inspector's decision. On appeal, the court sustained the Board's action and the oil company filed exceptions. The court dismissed the exceptions. The court found that the 45 day decision requirement in Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 58107(f) did not require notice within 45 days and that it only required that a decision was to be made within 45 days. Therefore, the Board's failure to provide notice within 45 days did not violate that statute. However, the Board failed to provide notice within a reasonable time under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 58107(h). The court found that the error did not result in prejudice to the oil company. The court found that the notice received by the oil company was not so inadequate as to warrant a reversal because the oil company failed to present substantial evidence of prejudice that resulted from the notice.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers filed a suit in equity against defendants, a school district and tax collectors, to enjoin them from collecting occupation taxes from the taxpayers for certain school years on the grounds that their occupation was that of farmer and that, as such, they were not liable for the tax under the &quot;Tax Anything Act&quot; of June 25, 1947, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53&sect; 6851, et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Tax Anything Act authorized local governments to impose a tax upon occupations, but, in exception (4), the act provided that such governments did not have authority to collect a tax on farm products produced in the local school district or on the processing thereof for use. The taxpayers contended that, as farmers, they were exempt from an occupation tax that the borough enacted, ostensibly under the authority of the act. The chancellor agreed, holding that the grant of an authority to impose taxes was to be strictly construed against the taxing authority. Although the act did not specifically exempt the &quot;occupation&quot; of farmer, that fact was not sufficient to show that the legislature intended to permit a tax on the occupation, especially in light of the broad provisions of exception (4). The chancellor held that the school district could not, under the Tax Anything Act, tax the occupation of farmer. The chancellor rejected defendants' argument that his interpretation of the act rendered it unconstitutional under Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1, which provided for uniformity of taxation. The constitutional requirement was met so long as the act was uniform as to all farmers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chancellor entered a decree nisi, in which it was adjudged that the school district and tax collectors were restrained from collecting the occupation tax from the taxpayers who were full-time farmers for certain school years.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractors applied for a building permit to erect six apartment buildings containing 102 dwelling units. The zoning of the area in which the complex was to have been erected was prohibited by the zoning ordinance. The contractors appealed to the Board alleging that a building permit had been denied. The Board granted a variance to permit the erection of the complex. The property owners appealed the decision. The court stated that variances were only to be granted where it was not contrary to the public interest and where the property involved was subjected to an unnecessary hardship unique or peculiar to itself and not to general conditions in the neighborhood, which may reflect the unreasonableness of the zoning ordinance. The court stated that there was not a shred of evidence that there was unnecessary hardship. The court found that the request for a variance was based upon the expectation that the property will be productive of greater financial gain if used for apartments. The court held that this was economic hardship, which did not constitute unnecessary hardship.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In December, 1962, the student inquired of the principal whether he would have been able to continue in athletics after his impending marriage. The student heard nothing further from the principal or from any school authority in relation to this matter until after the passage of a resolution on December 18, 1963, which precluded his participation in athletics. Meanwhile, in the spring and fall of 1963, he played a full season on the varsity baseball team and the varsity football team. It was not until January, 1964 that he was notified that he could not play on the varsity baseball team. The court concluded that the board's delay of over one year in taking action to prevent the student's participation in varsity sports after inquiry was made constituted laches. The court stated that the school district was estopped from preventing the student from playing baseball in the spring of 1964 because of the delay, the board's representation that the student's marriage would not prevent his athletic activities, and the student's participation in sports during the spring and fall of 1963.</SPAN></P>

The building inspector had denied the application because the company had not secured the written consent of the number of nearby property owners required by ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The oil company purchased land, intending to erect a service station. The building inspector denied the company's petition for a permit on the basis that the company had failed to obtain consent from the required number of neighboring property owners, as required by Ross Township, Pa. Zoning Ordinance No. 446, art. IV, &sect; 11. On appeal to the Board, the company contended that &sect; 11 was unconstitutional, and that the ordinance was discriminatory in that a service station was permitted under commercial district &quot;A,&quot; a more restrictive district, but was not permitted under the provisions of commercial district &quot;B.&quot; Evidence was also submitted showing unnecessary hardship to the company and the property's sellers. The Board affirmed the denial, and the company appealed. The court sustained the appeal, finding the property uniquely suited for the proposed use such that the denial of the permit would effect an unwarranted hardship. Thus, the refusal of the permit was a misuse of the Board's authority that should be corrected on appeal. Further, the ordinance allowing neighbors to arbitrarily bar the company's use of its property was an unconstitutional abdication of legislative authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant loaned a prosecutor money in exchange for a judgment note that required the repayment of the loan plus an additional 10 percent in 30 days. Defendant also obtained a security agreement against the prosecutor's chattels. The State charged defendant with a violation of &sect; 6(B) of the Act for charging interest greater than 6 percent without a license. Defendant asserted that the additional 10 percent was attributable to the costs of preparing the security agreement. The court refused to allow defendant to present the testimony of an attorney as to the costs of the preparation of the agreement because it had not been prepared by a member of the bar. The jury was instructed that unless the extra amount charged was interest, defendant was not guilty. The jury returned a guilty verdict, and defendant filed his motions. After a review of legislative history, the court rejected defendant's contentions that the Act did not apply to isolated transactions and that the Act imposed an unconstitutional classification on defendant.

They also argued that the proposed sale proceedings had been improper and that the church's charter did not permit the removal of the parish from the city. The court found that: (1) the general rule was that redress for such disputes had to be sought in the church hierarchy rather than in the courts; (2) alleged claims of irregularity in the proceedings leading to the purchase and sale were meritless and the community members had failed to pursue such claims in the church hierarchy; (3) the community members had no vested rights as lay members of their parish that were being violated by the situation; and (4) there was no basis for relief.</SPAN></P>

The tax was levied upon the occupations of all persons physically residing within the school district. The taxpayers owned real estate in excess of the amount required by Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 6853. However, the school district alleged that the taxpayers failed to allege that they were taxpayers of the school district, because the taxpayers asserted that they resided in a township, but the boundaries of a township and a school district could differ. Furthermore, the taxpayers failed to state a single fact showing that the school district levied both occupation and per capita taxes, much less any fact demonstrating what it was about the classification of taxpayers that was nonuniform, capricious, inaccurate, or arbitrary. The court was not to interfere with the reasonable discretion of the legislative body in selecting the subjects or fixing the rates of a tax. Furthermore, the court held that the taxpayers' remedy was by appeal from an assessment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">City of Pittsburgh, Pa., Fair Housing Ordinance No. 523 (1958) prohibited corporations from refusing to sell residential property on account of the race of the prospective purchaser. When the purchaser attempted to purchase a lot from the land company, its president refused to consummate the sale. Plaintiffs first argued that their reason for refusing to sell to the purchaser was not based solely on his race. Additionally, they argued that the ordinance was invalid and unconstitutional. The court found plaintiffs' statement of their reason for refusing to sell to be unconvincing. The court held that the ordinance was a valid enactment within the authority conferred upon the City by the Act of March 7, 1901, P.L. 20, art. XIX, &sect; 3, cl. XLIII, Pa. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court interpreted Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4603 (1939) under the fundamental principles that all presumptions were in favor of a statute's constitutionality and that the fact that it had gone unchallenged for many years was a strong argument in favor of its continued validity. Additionally, an act should not be declared unconstitutional unless it violated the constitution clearly, palpably, and plainly. The court rejected defendant's contention that the language of the statute was so vague and indefinite as to be violative of due process. The statute's terms were sufficiently explicit to inform defendant what conduct rendered him liable to its penalties. The statute was not unconstitutional because its application might be uncertain in exceptional cases. Areas of doubt were for resolution by the courts, not cause for invalidating the act. A construction of the act as clearly constitutional and only applying to gambling committed within the borders of the state was preferred to one that applied it to acts outside the state. The court also found that the act did not violate the constitution for punishing an illness because gambling was not a physical illness like drug addiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the complaint stated a cause of action cognizable in equity. The court held that it did not and sustained the company's motion for a demurrer. The court noted that there were no facts averred in the complaint which took it out of the operation of the general rule and that equity jurisdiction was not available where a remedy was available at law. Further, the court noted that the landowner had not exhausted his legal remedies because he had not appealed the zoning board's decision to the board. The court rejected the landowner's claim that the board of adjustment had already passed judgment upon the questions when it made its recommendation to the board of supervisors against the issuance of the permit. The court noted that, at that time, the board was acting as the investigatory agency of the board of supervisors. He did not say how he had been irreparably harmed, nor did he explain in what manner the remedies at law open to him were inadequate. He did not say how closely his property was located to that of the quarry site, or whether he was complaining about noise, dust, smoke, or the fact that the value of his property had been or would be depreciated.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 1222, under which a jury might assess costs against a defendant acquitted of a misdemeanor, was unconstitutional. The testimony at the trial disclosed that the alleged oath was clearly false. The court refused the motion, finding that libelous statements were not protected by the U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV, nor were they protected by Pa. Const. art. 1, &sect; 7. The court found that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 1222 was not unconstitutional. The Criminal Court of Pennsylvania had for more than a century followed the practice and procedure of requiring the jury to determine who should pay the costs in all misdemeanors petty in character. The court found that a jury could impose costs upon an acquitted defendant, even if the indictment was defective and no conviction could have been had upon it.</SPAN></P>

The caller made several more phone calls to her asking if she was interested. The prosecutrix called the police, and defendants were arrested at the site where a meeting was set up. The court held it did not need to consider matters of defense because the Commonwealth failed to establish the elements of the crime charged. First, the language of the statute referred only to words or language which were lewd, lascivious, or indecent and no such words were allegedly used. In addition, though the nature and purpose of the calls was reprehensible, it did not meet the purpose of the act, which was to make illegal disgusting and indecent language.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporate funeral director sought to have an employee approved as a temporary or standby funeral director while the regular funeral director was unavailable. The employee did not intend to work full time. The Board denied the corporate funeral director's request and also denied the employee's request to renew his funeral director's license. The denial of the license was based on the employee's request to be part-time instead of full time. The corporate funeral director and the employee sought review. The court sustained the appeal. The court found that the Board erred when it denied the employee's registration on the basis that he planned to a be a part-time director because neither Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 63, &sect; 479.1 or the rules promulgated by the Board required a director to be full time. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the employee was not qualified to serve as a funeral director. Therefore, the Board abused its administrative discretion. The board also erred when it denied the employee's request to be approved as temporary supervisor because the refusal was based on the Board's erroneous denial of the employee's license.</SPAN></P>

Railroad conceded that it owed a penalty for a late payment but disputed the additional amount. Railroad argued that it was entitled to a proportionate reduction of the full statutory penalty that was imposed for the late filing of its final tax returns because the Commonwealth had the use of the funds that the railroad paid at the time of its filing of its tentative tax returns. The Board filed preliminary objections, and argued that its refusal of the railroad's petition was final and not subject to judicial review and that an action in mandamus would not lie to control the judgment of an administrative tribunal when it was used as a substitute or alternative for an appeal. The court sustained the objections, and found that under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 503(e), the action of the Board was final and not subject to judicial review. Additionally, an action of mandamus could not be used as a method to obtain review when the legislature had declared that an agency action was final.</SPAN></P>

Section 1500 allowed signs of a maximum of 15 square feet in the residential district in which the sign at issue was located. The applicant then sought a variance. The township's zoning officer denied the variance. The zoning board affirmed the denial. The applicant filed the instant appeal, arguing that it needed the sign to help people locate its property. The court affirmed the decision of the zoning board. The sign continued to violate the township's ordinance because it exceeded the maximum size permitted under &sect; 1500.

The Act provided a manufacturing exemption after 11 years for businesses organized for manufacturing purposes. The court found that the word organized was synonymous with the word incorporated. The court determined that the legislature did not intend the word organized as used in the Act to have one meaning as applied to domestic corporations and an additional meaning when applied to foreign corporations. The court ruled that the accomplishment of the manufacturing exemption's purpose to provide incentives to business enterprises to establish and maintain manufacturing facilities in Pennsylvania should not be thwarted just because the taxpayer failed to comply with the regulation of disclosing its manufacturing purpose in the certificate of authority granted for the conduct of its corporate business in Pennsylvania. Sustaining the appeal, the court noted that the taxpayer's purpose was stated in its foreign certificate of incorporation.</SPAN></P>

The court considered defendants' exceptions to the adjudication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants instituted proceedings to determine a collective bargaining agent for the employer's employees at an installation in Philadelphia. The employer filed a petition denying the jurisdiction of the PLRB and asserting the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The employer obtained an adjudication enjoining defendants from investigating the proper bargaining unit and collective bargaining agent of its employees. Defendants asserted that the chancellor had no jurisdiction to determine the facts. The court stated that equity had jurisdiction to enjoin invalid administrative action. The record, including an admission by counsel for the PLRB, conclusively demonstrated that the employer was an employer engaged in interstate commerce within the meaning of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 141 et seq. A state agency had no jurisdiction to hear a labor dispute which was arguably subject to the jurisdiction of the NLRB. If a dispute which gave rise to litigation was a labor dispute over which the NLRB might have jurisdiction, the matter had to be litigated in the first instance before the NLRB, and a state agency was powerless to interfere.</SPAN></P>

The Board's preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer raised the defense that the act was constitutional. The taxpayer claimed that the legislature was not entitled to authorize different numbers of supervisors of a particular class of township, depending upon the population of the particular township. The court found no decision or authority in Pennsylvania to support the taxpayer's contention that the Act was unconstitutional. The court held that the legislature had authority pursuant to Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to be relieved of costs on the ground that the Act of March 31, 1860, P. L. 427, was unconstitutional. A jury had imposed costs against defendant, even though it had found him not guilty of unlawfully discharging a firearm at a person.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Separate bills of indictment charged defendant with two counts of unlawfully discharging a firearm at a person, a misdemeanor. A jury found him not guilty of both charges. The jury placed the costs of prosecution on the county for one of the bills. The jury made defendant responsible for the costs associated with the other bill. Defendant filed a motion to be relieved of costs. The court granted his motion. The Act of March 31, 1860, P. L. 427, like its 1805 predecessor, authorized the assessment of costs against an acquitted defendant. While the supreme court had found the predecessor constitutional in 1818, the court stated that more recent decisions required reexamination of the Act's constitutionality. In that regard, the Act was penal in nature and was unconstitutionally vague because it did not set forth the conduct that could result in the imposition of costs. The Act violated Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 1 because the legislature had given juries the power to inflict punishment without setting forth fixed tests or standards. The Act also violated equal protection because counties were solely responsible for costs in felony cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant's motion and set aside the jury's verdict to the extent that it required him to pay the costs of the prosecution. The court vacated the sentence that required defendant to pay costs or give security and that committed him until he had done so.</SPAN></P>

On defendants' motion to suppress and to quash, the court held that: (1) the facts warranting the conclusion of probable cause had to exist when such conclusion was made, and the search warrant could not be issued on a showing not that the law had not been or was not being committed; (2) no crime was being committed when the warrant was issued, and the officer had knowledge of such fact; (3) it would have been possible to have obtained a search warrant after the alleged offense had come into being and to have executed it while the alleged offense was still in progress; and (4) hence, there was no probable cause to support the issuance of the search warrant, to be executed at a future time when the officer believed the commission of the offense was then in progress.</SPAN></P>

The employee was terminated, and the borough refused to give him a hearing because his position was not subject to civil service requirements. The employee filed an action alleging that he was wrongfully discharged. The borough filed preliminary objections to the complaint. The objections were overruled. Pursuant to the Act of May 4, 1927, P.L. 519, all borough police offices were presumed to have been created by statute, making all borough police officers subject to civil service rules. It was clear that the legislature intended to make the Act retroactive; therefore it applied to the employee and his complaint stated a valid cause of action. Because the purpose of the Act was to provide a uniform law applicable to all municipal employees, it was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Among many grounds, the motion alleged that the Act was too vague, indefinite, and uncertain, that it did not define an offense, that it prescribed no standard for determining if the words used were lewd, lascivious, or indecent, and that it impinged on the free speech guarantee. On review, the court rejected defendant's various challenges to the Act's constitutionality, holding that many of the cases cited by defendant were not in point and refusing to hold the Act invalid merely because it did not prohibit other acts that were equally mischievous. The court held that the Criminal Procedure Act of 1960 (Pennsylvania) made it sufficient to charge offenses substantially in the words of a statute, that obscenity was not protected speech, and that the failure to define obscenity or to include the standard for a determination in the statute at issue was not fatal to its validity.</SPAN></P>

A sample of defendant's product was analyzed in August of 1960. The guaranteed analysis appearing on the sample can indicated not less than three percent of crude fat. The analysis of by the Commonwealth's agriculture department revealed that the amount of fat found in the sample was almost four times that percentage. A justice of the peace found defendant guilty of distribution of an adulterated commercial feed. In its petition for allowance of appeal, defendant claimed in part that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 3, &sect;&sect; 57.3 and 57.6(c) were ambiguous and vague without reference to limitation or tolerance of variance and that vegetable and animal content necessarily had a degree of variation. The court refused defendant's appeal because defendant was properly found guilty on the proof submitted before the justice of the peace and &sect; 57.6(c), considered as a whole, was a valid exercise of the Commonwealth's police power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that it could not substitute its judgment for that of the Secretary. The court could merely decide whether, on the evidence presented, a violation of The Vehicle Code (Pennsylvania) occurred. If it did, then in the absence of important mitigating circumstances, the suspension had to be sustained. For appellant to succeed, the court had to find by a preponderance of evidence (a) that a violation did not occur, or (b) if a violation did occur, that there existed such attenuating circumstances as would justify setting aside the suspension. The court set aside the suspension. The right of the Secretary to suspend appellant's license because of the fatal accident and after conviction by a jury on the charge of involuntary manslaughter was not questioned. However, the Secretary, with full knowledge of all of the important facts in the case, could not suspend appellant's license based on exactly the same facts. The imposition of an additional suspension constituted a double penalty. Appellant's driving privilege was restored.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 1827.2 et seq. (1953).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state bank merged with a national bank, and the state bank was the surviving corporation. The Commonwealth imposed a domestic excise tax upon the subsequent increase of the authorized capital of the surviving state bank that was equivalent to the exact value of the capital of the component national bank on which no bonus or excise tax was theretofore payable because the national bank had been exempt from such tax. The bank paid the tax under protest, and unsuccessfully petitioned a board for a tax resettlement. On appeal, the bank argued in part that the board erred in refusing to vacate the order, and in refusing to allow the bank a credit for excise tax purposes for the full par value of the shares of stock in the national bank outstanding at the time of the merger. The Commonwealth claimed that the new capital stock of the surviving bank was fully taxable under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 1827.2(f) (1953), which only applied to state banks. The court observed that the national bank lost its immunity from taxation under &sect; 1827.2(f) when it surrendered its national charter and became a state corporation, thereby subjecting itself to the jurisdiction of the domestic excise tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two plaintiffs argued that the court should declare the statutes unconstitutional and order the legislature to reapportion prior to the general election, enjoining by such an order further election procedures as to those candidates who had already been nominated. Defendants and two other plaintiffs suggested that the matter of reapportionment be held in abeyance until the legislature was given an opportunity to reapportion at its next session. The court stated that immediate injunctive relief could only result in stopping the election machinery, thereby denying the electorate the right to vote for those persons who had been duly nominated in the primary election. Furthermore, it had not been clear until a recent United States Supreme Court decision that reapportionment presented a justiciable issue. The legislature had been informed by that decision, as it had not been before, that constitutional apportionment was a matter that could be adjudicated if the legislature failed to make a reapportionment. Accordingly, there should be no attempt to adjudicate the reapportionment issue until the legislature had had an opportunity to reapportion the districts at its forthcoming session.</SPAN></P>

There was evidence that the cousin's mother was the sister of the deceased's mother, thus allowing the cousin to inherit. The trustee excepted to the account on the ground that the cousin had not proved that no heirs existed on the decedent's paternal side of the family. The court found that a statute making the children of a supposed marriage legitimate, which would have required that the distribution be withheld until it was established that no heirs existed on the paternal side of the deceased's family, was not applicable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The estate was established as a corporate body under Pennsylvania Act of April 5, 1862, P.L. 407, after the decedent left the residue of his estate to the County Commissioners for road improvement projects and for the poor. The decedent's will, as drafted, was defective but his heirs and the Commonwealth created the corporate body to carry out the intent of the testator through a charitable trust instrument and enabling legislation. The Commissioners oversaw the estate and bought shares of stock. The auditors filed a declaratory action for a determination of whether the Commissioners as fiduciaries of the estate could invest the funds in stock because Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect; 7, (1874) did not allow counties to be stockholders. The court found that statutory scheme that enabled the Commissioners to serve as the estate fiduciaries was constitutional. Because the corporate body was a separate entity, there was no violation of the prohibition against county government investments in securities. It was lawful for the Commissioners to invest the permanent capital fund of the estate in securities that were legal investments for funds in the hands of fiduciaries.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner sought review of a decision of the Zoning Board of Adjustment of Lower Gwynedd Township (Pennsylvania), which affirmed the order of a zoning officer for the removal of a sign from the owner's property that was not in compliance with Lower Gwynedd Township, Pa., Zoning Ordinance art. IX, &sect; 1500 (1941, as amended). The court adopted the zoning board's findings of fact in toto.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner was a chemical and paint manufacturer, and the property in question was used as an experimental farm to test some of the property owner's chemicals. The property was zoned for residential use. The sign advertised the property as a research farm for a chemical. The sign was significantly larger than the sizes allowed under &sect; 1500. On appeal, the court affirmed the order of the zoning board. Section 1500 was constitutional because it was an ordinance that preserved the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare, and it was not unjustly discriminatory, arbitrary, unreasonable, or confiscatory in its application to the property. The sign was not incidental to and an accessory to the main operation and use of the property as a farm. The sign related to a chemical manufactured by the property owner at another location; it was immaterial that the chemical was used on some of the plants on the property. The sign was not necessary to the property's use as a farm. The court found that the property owner's appeal was in essence an application for a variance, which could not issue because no abuse of discretion by the zoning board had been established.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the zoning board, which upheld the order of a zoning officer that ordered the property owner to remove an advertising sign from its property.

The female children were given the income for life and upon death, provision was made for each of their children for equal portions of said one-fifth part for life or in remainder upon marriage and issue born. One died in 1939, survived by two married daughters with issue and one unmarried son. The son died in 1959. The court found that the remainder interests of the decedent's daughters had to vest, if at all, within the rule against perpetuities because they and their brother were all born in the testator's lifetime and no other child was born to the decedent after the testator's death. The court determined that since the daughters had married and had issue born at the time of the decedent's death, they had then a vested interest in the remainder of their brother's one-third portion subject to be divested if he had issue born, in which event he would have received the corpus of his one-third portion.

The court relied upon a case, which stated that a rational evidentiary relationship existed between the results of a radar and the speed of a car checked by them. The court found that it took judicial notice of the accuracy of radar. The court stated that the fact that radar was new was no reason to reject its use as a means of measuring speed of vehicles.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners contended that the action of the township zoning inspector and the Board resulted in an improper, unreasonable and arbitrary exercise of the police power and that Pulaski Township, Pennsylvania, Zoning Ordinance art. XIV, &sect;1(2), was unconstitutional in its application to the landowners in that it violated the liberties, rights, and privileges guaranteed to them by Pa. Const. art. 2, &sect; 1 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV in denying the landowners the use and benefit of their property without compensation. This zoning ordinance was adopted by the Township under the authority of the Act of May 1, 1933, P. L. 103 (Pennsylvania) and its supplements and amendments, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 67001, et seq. The landowners argued that this grant of power to the township supervisors was a transfer of the discretion to invoke or not to invoke the police powers of the State to local authorities in this area. The court noted that considerations of the general welfare alone were sufficient to support the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance, and it was not necessary that it also be substantially related to preserving or promoting the public health or safety or morals.</SPAN></P>

Objectors filed a rule on the board to show cause why the petition should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The rule was based on the alleged unconstitutionality of the amendment to the Act of 1961 as being an improper delegation to the court of quarter sessions of legislative power in violation of Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 because it failed to establish any standards to guide the court in performing its function under the Act. In discharging the rule, the court held that the Act of 1861 did not give the court unfettered discretion that amounted to abdication by the legislature of its function and a usurpation of that function by the court. The Act limited the court's action to providing for the election of two additional supervisors, and the choice of the additional supervisors was left to the electorate. Further, the language of the Act was peremptory, requiring the court to act. Finally, there were sufficient standards present to constitute a valid delegation of power to the courts of quarter sessions.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that the statute was not unconstitutional because the term &quot;improper conduct&quot; was not vague and indefinite but rather had a definite meaning, that is, that the Secretary could suspend an official inspection station license where the business was being conducted in an inappropriate, unfit, or unsuitable manner.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the taxpayer argued that it did not register as a foreign corporation engaged in business in Pennsylvania, and that consequently it did not receive a certificate of authority to do business in the Commonwealth, and that therefore it was exempt from the Excise Tax Act. The taxpayer conceded that it did register in the Department of State the power of attorney and statement provided for in the Act of June 8, 1911, 1911 Pa. Laws 710, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 3142; however, the taxpayer argued that registration with the Department under the Act of 1911 was not the same as issuance of a certificate of authority to do business. The Board contended that the document received by the taxpayer upon its filing a power of attorney and statement with the Department was a &quot;Certificate of Authority.&quot; The court dismissed the appeals and held that the taxpayer was liable for the foreign excise tax for the privilege of doing business in the Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fire department was organized as a nonprofit corporation to support a fire engine. In order to maintain an engine, the fire department erected a firehouse. The county board assessed a tax upon the firehouse and refused to exempt it completely from taxation. The fire department sought review. The court dismissed the appeal. The court held that the amendment, the Act of August 14, 1959, 1959 P. L. 707, &sect; 1, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 5020-204(c), to the Act of May 22, 1933, 1933 P. L. 853, &sect;204(c), which included the words &quot;fire and rescue station&quot; to exempt properties was unconstitutional because no attempt was made to define what was meant by the words &quot;fire and rescue station.&quot; The court opined that the way that the amendment was drafted did not come within the strict limitation of the exemption provisions of Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1. The court reasoned that it could not find that the services that the fire department rendered were &quot;legitimate subjects of charity.&quot; The court concluded that the record indicated that a considerable amount of the fire department's operating income was derived from non-exempt activities, such as the sale of alcoholic beverages.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. tit. 31, &sect; 700j-402 (1959). The farmers filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer to the Commission's complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission's sole complaint against the farmers was that they had been selling milk in lawfully limited quantities at the farm where it was produced, but from which the milk was temporarily removed for pasteurization in their plant. The farmers contended that the amendment, which they allegedly violated, was a denial of equal protection of the laws in violation of the U.S. Const. amend XIV and that it was special legislation and violative of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 7. The question was whether the proviso in the 1959 amendment, which barred a farmer from selling milk that had at any time left the farm prior to its sale to the consumer, was reasonable, necessary, and founded upon a real distinction in order to safeguard the public health or promote public interest. The court found that it was not. It was apparent that the prohibition against temporary removal of milk from the producer's farm was unnecessary to protect the public health; the public was abundantly protected under the provisions of the Milk Control Law. The classification could not rest on the tenuous fact that the milk has been temporarily removed from one of the farmers' properties to another for pasteurization.</SPAN></P>

The panel recommended the adoption of a survivors' and dependents' pension plan to be financed by equal contributions from the firemen and the city. On appeal, the court sought to determine whether it had the duty and power to command the council of the city to pass ordinance consonant the with the findings of the negotiation panel under the provisions of the Act of 1947. The court concluded that the act did not require defendants to enact the legislation as prayed for, and if it did, it could not have been enforced because it attempted to delegate a nondelegable function under the Constitution. The court concluded that had defendants refused to submit the disputes to conciliation as required by the act, or had they refused to consider the recommendations of the panel, it could have compelled them to follow the directions of the statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agent had for years represented persons before the zoning division of the Board and before the Board itself.

The agent averred that his right to appear before the Board for a party he represented had been unlawfully denied by Rule 8. The court disagreed, denied the motion for summary judgment, and dismissed the complaint. The court found that (1) Rule 8 was valid and enforceable and did not violate 1929 Pa.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was the practice of the trustees when they purchased bonds at a price above face value, to amortize the premiums so paid out of income to the date of their respective maturities or the date when the bonds were called for payment, generally at 100, whichever was earlier. That was done by charging income periodically, as receiving, and crediting the amount to an amortization reserve. As such bonds were sold or paid off, the premium paid upon them was charged against the reserve and the amount of any profit or loss, after providing for amortization, was credited or charged to principal, as the case was. Petitioner, who had an interest in one-ninth of the income and a contingent interest in a stirpital share of the principal, objected to amortization out of income in any amount, and contended that all premiums had to be borne by principal alone. He therefore insisted that the entire sum expended for premiums, which was charged to income and credited to the amortization reserve during the period covered by the accounting, should be distributed to the income beneficiaries. The court refused the beneficiary's request and confirmed the accounting.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent had two children, both of whom were citizens of the United States by birth.

The company filed a petition for modification and the award of the referee was in favor of the widow. The company appealed the award to the Board and the award was disallowed. Thereafter, the widow appealed to the court. The company contended that, since the widow removed from the United States to her native Italy, she was not entitled to compensation benefits because &sect; 310 of the Pennsylvania Workmen's Compensation Act of June 21, 1939, P. L. 520, precluded a non resident alien dependent from obtaining compensation. The court held that the Italian-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation, ratified in 1949, invalidated &sect; 310 by virtue of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution and that the widow was entitled to compensation. The court concluded, therefore, that the Board committed an error of law in reversing the award of the referee, thereby denying the widow compensation because her removal did cause a change in status.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimants sought an audit of the account filed by respondent trustee. The issue was what rules of apportionment applied to the inter vivos trust pursuant to its termination following the death of the cotrustee and life tenant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trust was created with a nominal sum. By its terms, the settlor reserved to herself the income for life. Following her death, she provided for the payment out of principal of certain pecuniary gifts and directed that the balance of principal be held in further trust to pay the net income to her son for life. The settlor left her entire residuary estate to the trustees under the trust. By the deed of trust, she reserved the right to herself and all beneficiaries under the trust to make subsequent additions to the corpus, which were to be held subject to the provisions of the deed. The issue was whether the Uniform Principal and Income Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 20, &sect; 3471 (1945), controlled apportionments from the principal so added. The court found that it did not. Because the decisional law of the Pennsylvania Rule of Apportionment established a vested property right in the life tenant, the retroactive provisions of &sect; 17 of Act, which took income belonging to the life tenant and passed it to the remainderman, rendered it unconstitutional as applied to trusts created prior to its enactment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties stipulated that defendant lived on a farm which was his livelihood and that one day he found three deer destroying its crops and killed them with a .22 caliber rifle, which was the only gun he owned. Defendant argued that in requiring that deer not be killed with anything smaller than a .25 caliber rifle, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 34, &sect; 1311.724(2) violated his right under Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, to protect his property. The Commonwealth claimed the provision was a reasonable regulation of the means used to protect one's property. Noting that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 34, 1311.704, allowed killing deer in hunting season with a .22 caliber rifle, the court found it incongruous that deer could be killed by such a rifle during in season, but its killing by the same rifle to protect one's property was a criminal offense. Noting that when strict compliance with the terms of a statute was impossible, compliance as near as could be was allowed, and that the Commonwealth's interest in protecting wildlife had to be enforced via reasonable restrictions, the court found that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 34, &sect; 1311.724(2) was unduly burdensome and violated Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was driving a combination truck tractor and semi-trailer when he was stopped by a police officer. The combined weight of the truck tractor, semi-trailer, and it load exceeded by 42,500 pounds the weight permitted by law. Defendant pled guilty to the charge of operating his vehicle with a combined weight in excess of the legal limit. The justice of the peace ordered defendant to pay a fine of $ 4,200. On appeal, the court held that defendant was not permitted to attack the information on the ground that it was filed under the improper statutory provision. The court stated that defendant's guilty plea admitted all of the averments of fact and waived any defects in form of allegations and all defects that were not jurisdictional. The court determined that an appeal from a summary conviction waived all procedural or other irregularities. The court found that the fine imposed on defendant was not excessive. The court noted that a state, in the exercise of its police power and in the absence of congressional action, could impose reasonable restrictions on the weight and size of vehicles that travelled its highways and prescribe a graduated scale of fines for violations thereof.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court considered the exceptions filed by the life tenants under a trust created by the settlor through a deed of trust and the exceptions filed by the appointed guardian ad litem for minor beneficiaries under the trust and by the trustee ad litem for unascertained remainderman. The parties disputed whether the life tenants were entitled to certain dividends and profits from the sale of stocks under the Pennsylvania Rule of Apportionment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The life tenants, the guardian ad litem, and the trustee ad litem disputed whether the proceeds from transactions related to stock held by the trust constituted income that were payable to the life tenants under the terms of the trust. Exceptions were made to the adjudication made by the president judge of the court. Upon consideration of the exceptions, the court dismissed the exceptions, the court ordered the trustee of the trust to make certain apportionment calculations, and confirmed the prior adjudication completely. The Rule of Apportionment applied to the trust, given the date of the creation of the trust, but the Rule of Apportionment only applied in several situations, which the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania refused to enlarge upon, given the complexity and lack of practicality of the Rule of Apportionment. A certain sale of stock by the trustee was not an apportionable event, and the entire proceeds remained with the trust's principal. Dividends on other stock were apportionable and the trustee was directed to make the appropriate calculations. A stock split did not trigger apportionment where any part of the stock dividend came from the &quot;capital surplus&quot; of the stock.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the exceptions filed by the parties and held that the sale of certain stock and a stock split did not constitute apportionable events and that the life tenants were not entitled to receive the proceeds from those transactions as income, and that the issuance of other stock dividends constituted apportionable events. The trustee was instructed to make certain apportionments, and the adjudication was confirmed absolutely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers based their claim that the occupation tax was invalid on three principal grounds. Those grounds were that it violated the &quot;uniformity&quot; clause of Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1, that it was based on an invalid assessment, and that it purported to tax certain occupations that could not by law be taxed. The school district contended that remedy available to the taxpayers for improper valuations was by way of appeal from such assessments rather than by a suit to invalidate the entire tax resolution. The court agreed with the school district that the taxpayers had no right to judicial review until they had exhausted their administrative appeal of the assessments. The court held that even though some of the taxpayers' occupations were improperly valued, that fact furnished no basis for declaring the tax resolution unconstitutional or for enjoining its enforcement. However, the court found that the school district's resolution was invalid under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 46, &sect; 555 (1937) insofar as it purported to levy a tax on the occupation of farmers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

Ann. tit. 34, &sect; 1311.808, was unconstitutional in that the definition of &quot;safety zone&quot; was vague, indefinite, and unspecific. The court held that: (1) the transcript was fatally defective because defendant was charged with violating the second paragraph of &sect; 808, under which the offense of hunting was not complete unless the acts were done willfully; however, the statement of the offense charged omitted the word &quot;wilfully,&quot; and the finding of guilty by the justice likewise omitted the word &quot;wilfully&quot;; (2) defendant did not waive the error in the transcript by taking an appeal because the error went to the jurisdiction of the justice; and (3) it was unnecessary to consider defendant's constitutional issue because the first ground for quashing the transcript was sustained.</SPAN></P>

A logical implication from the words of the statute was that the legislature required a showing of scienter on the part of the seller as one of the conditions of conviction under the statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A summons in trespass was issued. A justice of the peace (Pennsylvania) rendered judgment in favor of plaintiff. Defendant presented a petition for special allowance of an appeal under the Act of May 17, 1956, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 42, &sect; 913a. Plaintiff then filed a petition to dismiss the appeal. A rule to show cause on plaintiff's petition was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his petition for special allowance of an appeal, defendant contended that an injustice had been done by virtue of the justice of the peace's verdict. When the case was argued on defendant's petition for special allowance of an appeal, the question of the constitutionality of the Act of May 17, 1956 was argued. The Act of May 17, 1956 allowed a right of appeal in a trespass cases where a judgment exceeded $ 100. In affirming plaintiff's judgment, the court held that the Act of May 17, 1956 was constitutional because it merely increased the monetary amount in cases in which an appeal could be taken. The intent of the Act of May 17, 1956 was to allow an appeal by special exception only in cases where a real miscarriage of justice had occurred before a justice of the peace. Defendant only inferentially alleged that the justice of the peace did not render a verdict in accordance with the evidence produced before him; defendant did not object to the justice of the peace's jurisdiction. Because there was only a conflict in the evidence before the justice of the peace, the court was unable to say that the justice of the peace abused his discretion in rendering judgment for plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court made the rule to show cause absolute and struck off the order allowing the appeal. The court affirmed plaintiff's judgment and ordered defendant to pay costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners contended that they were deprived of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. The truck operator was more than a driver who moved only under specific and direct orders from the principal. His title was &quot;operating engineer&quot; and he had other duties in connection with construction activities of the principal. Under the circumstances, it was apparent that since the operator was operating within the scope of his duties and the carrying of that burden and the time of its being carried was a matter of discretion with him, the principals were bound by the actions of their agent. Under the facts, which placed the fine upon the operator and impounded the truck in default thereof, was not unconstitutional, and further, the contention of the owners that they had no notice of the arrest and conviction was of no avail because notice to the agent was notice to the principal. The purpose of the Act of May 1, 1929, P. L. 905, as amended by the Act of June 30, 1955, P. L. 225, Pa. Stat.

Ann. tit. 50, &sect; 1304, in consideration of the discharge of a patient from a mental institution following a determination by medical authorities that his mental illness was in remission. The patient had been adjudged not guilty by reason of insanity on a charge of larceny prior to his commitment. The patient was remanded to custody pending the court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court considered an apparent conflict between provisions of the Act. Under &sect; 801(6) of the Mental Health Act, the patient was entitled to release from confinement in a mental hospital as soon as he was restored to mental health and was competent to manage his own affairs. Section 604 of the Mental Health Act suggested that if a patient was acquitted of a crime due to insanity, if he was committed to a mental hospital under the Act, and if he regained his mental health, he was not automatically entitled to his freedom. Medical authorities, in light of the patient's past criminal and mental health histories, opined that the patient was likely to violate the law again in some manner. The court ordered the patient's release, conditioned upon his compliance with a plan for psychiatric outpatient probation. The court held that its remedy of a conditional release of the patient did not conflict with the purpose and the scheme of the Act, and that it was not a usurpation of power for the court to fashion such a remedy. Under &sect; 801(6) of the Mental Health Act, the patient was entitled to release, and &sect; 604 of the Mental Health Act did not authorize further confinement of the patient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered and decreed that the patient be released from custody, subject to his compliance with several conditions set forth by the court for psychiatric outpatient probation.</SPAN></P>

The court sustained the demurrer and concluded that mechanic's liens were not allowed for fencing where the owner's buildings had been erected some substantial time before the fence. The court refused to allow the mechanic's lien because allowing a lien for fences would have violated Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 7, as such liens did not exist prior to the adoption of the Pennsylvania Constitution in 1874. The court rejected the subcontractor's contention that a mechanic's lien for the fence installation was permitted under Pa. Stat.

The court granted the petition and ordered that the lien claim be stricken. The court noted that other houses remained unfinished at the time when the supplier filed its lien claim. However, the court ruled that, under the Act, a separate lien claim had to be filed within six months after a claimant's last work upon the particular house against which the lien was filed. The court ruled that by furnishing materials, the lien was preserved only as to the particular house to which the material went, not to the entire property covered by the contract.

The fact that the &quot;drag-strip&quot; was located in a rural neighborhood did not permit the conclusion that the operation thereof could not possibly be a nuisance in fact, even if it was not a nuisance per se.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a complaint against defendants, the City of Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Housing Authority, to have an ordinance authorizing the Authority to purchase or condemn lands declared unconstitutional and to restrain defendants from acting on the authority contained in the ordinance. Defendants filed preliminary objections to the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's complaint attacked the power of the City to authorize the Authority to acquire non-contiguous structures and tracts in a general area and to thereafter rent them as a low-income housing project and the power of the Authority to act on the authorization. In response, defendants averred that the complaint failed to state a cause of action because the Housing Authorities Law of May 28, 1937, P.L. 955, 35 PS &sect; 1541 et seq. (Pennsylvania), contained ample power to support the project authorized by the ordinance and there was no requirement that a project be contiguous. The court determined that the power to take property indiscriminately over a large area and replace owner-occupants or tenant occupants with families of admitted low income was a drastic power, not one to be granted lightly, and had to be grounded on a legally sufficient base of authority. The court also noted that the issue of whether the project would be competitive with private enterprise, an issue that merited consideration, could not be decided on the present state of the record. The court concluded that, at the pleadings stage, the complaint stated a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered an order dismissing defendants' preliminary objections and ordered defendants to answer the complaint within 20 days.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the Act was constitutional and that special allowance was only to be granted for cause shown. Additionally, the court found that defendant did not allege sufficient grounds to permit the appeal by special allowance by asserting that his negligence was improperly found, or upon allegations that plaintiff was contributorily negligence. Mere conflicts of evidence did not support an order permitting the appeal, and defendant was unable to provide proof that he asked for a continuance in order to allow time for his procurement of an additional witness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustees who had been the executors of an estate that created the trust that the trustees had administered for many years, filed a third account and requested additional compensation for their services as trustees. The court rejected this request because, under the authority of the Act of May 1, 1953, P.L. 190, it had no authority to award compensation to the trustees for services as trustees except on assets, which did not pass through their hands as executors regardless of the character and nature of their services as trustee. The court did agree that some retroactive compensation could be allowed under the Act of May 1, 1951, P.L. 190, as interim compensation prior to the termination of the trust because the remainder principal interests were not deprived of anything they would otherwise receive, as the trustees were entitled to a commission on the termination of the trust. The court also found that the request for attorney fees should be refused, as the amount received by counsel earlier was adequate and not disproportionate. Finally, the court determined the amount owed to the guardian ad litem and trustee ad litem appointed by the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fundamental question involved was whether the Act of 1955, making it a misdemeanor to engage in the budget planning business, was an unconstitutional exercise of the police power of the State in violation of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1 and 9, and Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 7, or the U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The Commonwealth contended that the act did not arbitrarily, unreasonably. and unnecessarily interfere with private business or property and that in did not prohibit the business of budget planning. The court rejected the Commonwealth's argument. The court held that the act was in fact an absolute prohibition against the business of budget planning and to deny the budget planner the right, at the request of the debtor, to receive money from the debtor and distribute the same among certain specified creditors in accordance with a plan agreed upon, constituted a nullification of a vital factor of the budget planning business. The business of budget planning was not inherently immoral or dangerous to public welfare and, therefore, it should not have been prohibited. The act unduly restricted the liberty of persons, guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, to engage in a useful business.</SPAN></P>

Ann. tit. 42, &sect; 913a, the motorist was not permitted to appeal because the judgment amount did not exceed $ 100, and because the motorist had not petitioned the common pleas court for special allowance. The motorist moved for judgment on the pleadings. He contended that the Act was unconstitutional because, as his case involved more than $ 20 he had an absolute right to a trial by jury. The court denied the motion and entered judgment for the prothonotary. The court held that the motorist was not deprived of his constitutional rights by requirement to apply for a special allowance of an appeal. By failing to make such a timely application, he lost his right of appeal.

The taxpayers sought to restrain collection of additional taxes for the district over three years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers argued that the Public School Code of March 10, 1949, P. L. 30, &sect; 1701, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 17-1701, et seq., as amended, permitted an unlawful delegation of authority by the member school districts and that all taxes collected and paid over to either the board or the authority were void. The court disagreed, and noted that the school board or its representatives had a voice in the control of the joint school district in fixing the amount to be expended and the proportion to be paid by each district. The school directors of the individual districts then set the millage and the per capita tax to be paid. The directors were still answerable to the electorate and could be voted out of office if their acts displeased a majority of the district voters. Therefore, the court held that the electorate had reasonable control over the acts of the board and the statute did not give an unreasonable delegation of authority. Accordingly, the statute was constitutional. The court held that laches gave the taxpayers no standing to seek the other relief sought regarding the tax rate increase, because of the length of time they waited before petitioning the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners contended that a swimming pool was not within the constitutional definition of the word &quot;structure&quot; as used in the Pa.

The court first went through the history of the mechanic's lien statutes and found that the phrase &quot;structures or other improvements&quot; in the 1901 Act might have been intended to change the settled law, but it could not constitutionally extend the right to file a lien to claims not measuring up to the standard of Pa. Act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 695, &sect; 1. Although the 1836 Act did not designate the character of the building to which a mechanic's lien might attach, if the structures were of a substantial and permanent character and might in any reasonable sense be known as buildings, they could be encumbered by a lien. The court stated that Pa. Mechanic's Lien Act of June 4, 1901, P. L. 431, &sect; 2, Pa. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supplier, a foreign corporation, entered into a fair trade agreement with many of its dealers whereby it set minimum retail prices for its products.

Upon the hearing, the court discovered that the supplier also operated its own retail outlets in the state and actively solicited patronage from customers equally available to the dealer. The court held that the agreement was a restraint of trade that was not specifically exempted by the Miller-Tydings Act or the McGuire Act of July 14, 1952, 66 Stat. 632, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 45(a)(5) because such exemptions were not available between persons in competition with each other.

Furthermore, the regulation by the Secretary of Revenue (Pennsylvania) providing that a station wagon must be registered according to its use was invalid because the legislature had not delegated such power to the Secretary, nor could the legislature give the Secretary the power to create a criminal offense and define the punishment therefor under Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a bus company, appealed from an action of respondent, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, by its Board of Finance and Revenue, in refusing the company's petition for redetermination of the amount of fuel use tax assessed for a certain month, which assessment was made by the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue under the provisions of the Fuel Use Tax Act of 1952, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 2614.1, et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company was formerly a duly authorized operator of intrastate motor buses within Pennsylvania and other states and was licensed under the Pennsylvania Fuel Use Tax Act of 1952. In its report of fuel use for the month at issue, the company apportioned the fuel tax for that month on the basis of the percentage of fuel use for mileage traveled over Pennsylvania highways, as compared to the total miles traveled, and paid the tax based upon the apportionment. The Department performed an audit and imposed the fuel use tax upon all fuel placed in the company's buses within Pennsylvania during the month. The company was denied sought a redetermination by the Board, and the company appealed. The court found for the Commonwealth, concluding that the tax was properly assessed because it was an excise tax on local use, and its incidence was on the privilege of placing the fuel into the company's supply tanks, in which transaction the fuel was used within the meaning of the Fuel Use Tax Act. Further, the tax did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment or the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, as it was too indirect and remote from the function of interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found for the Commonwealth and directed that judgment be entered in its favor unless exceptions were filed within 30 days.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The class representatives attacked the taxing ordinance on the basis that the lack of uniformity of the tax was discriminatory and confiscatory in nature. They claimed that the tax violated Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1. That section provided that all taxes were to be uniform upon the same class of subjects within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax. The basic argument advanced was that such a tax was inequitable in its application because it in effect discriminated against a method or mode of transacting business. They asserted that it had to be agreed that if one conducted his business by the use of an automatic vending machine, he had to pay a tax. Whereas another person engaged in precisely the same business did not pay the same tax if he did not have the machine, although he may in fact sell the same product. The court dismissed the exceptions. The court upheld the ordinance because although it was discriminatory, there was a rational basis for the separate classification of taxable subjects.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance also required that each business pay a licensing fee. The photographer commenced an action in equity against the borough and the borough officials. The photographer sought an injunction estopping the borough from enforcing the ordinance. The court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional and issued the injunction. The court held that the ordinance as imposed against the photographer was nothing more or less than a tax imposed upon it for revenue purposes. As such, the court opined, the ordinance was void. The court reasoned that the ordinance was void because it contained no regulations, the license fee imposed by the ordinance bore no reasonable relation to the cost of enforcing the ordinance, and exempted residents of the borough and applied only to transients.

The taxpayers filed an application for a preliminary injunction estopping the Board from holding the hearing. The court refused the application. The court held that the Board's first order that assessed the tax owed at none was in effect. The court opined that the Board's order fixing a rehearing did not determine any of the issues involved in the administrative hearing. The court reasoned that there was a statutory remedy in which not only the validity of the assessment of taxes under the Pennsylvania Sales Tax Act could have been determine, but also there was statutory authority for the Board to make its order for the Board to conduct its rehearing.

The title of the resolution expressed a purpose of imposing a tax on certain transactions and privileges relating to new construction and additions constituting new dwellings used for residence. The construction company filed a complaint to enjoin the collection of the tax, alleging that the resolution was unconstitutional. The school district's answer denied the construction company's legal conclusions as the grounds for invalidity, but raised no issue of material fact. The court determined that the resolution was inoperative because it was vague and indefinite and no taxable subject was stated in the resolution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff municipal sewer authority sought an appointment of a board of viewers to assess the benefits of a sewer to defendant property owners.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sewer was constructed under an ordinance permitting assessments of property owners according to the front-foot rule. Two years after the construction of the sewer, the sewer authority attempted to assess the property owners for the construction of the sewer even though the sewer was not laid along any of the frontage of their property. The property owners alleged that the assessment violated the due process of law provisions of U. S. Const. amend. XIV. The property owners also alleged that the sewer authority lacked the authority to levy an assessment for improvements against their property after the improvements were installed. The sewer authority alleged that the property owners benefited by the sewer's construction, were using the sewer, and should pay for such benefits. The court held that the sewer authority lacked the authority to assess the property owners for the sewer's construction or to pass an ordinance after the sewer's construction to include assessments based on the benefit theory. The court held that the ordinance providing for assessments on the front-foot rule was not broad enough to support an assessment on the theory of benefit.</SPAN></P>

Ann. tit. 27, &sect; 333 (1953). The railroad company brought a petition for a rule to show cause why the petition in escheat should not be dismissed, arguing that the statute of limitations had run. The court ruled that the statute of limitations was an affirmative defense to be pleaded in a responsive pleading under the heading &quot;New Matter&quot; pursuant to Pa. R. Civ. P. 1030, and that it was not, therefore, a proper subject of preliminary objections. Further, the court held that the fact that the statute of limitations could have run against the owners of the property in controversy as between them and an accountable corporate custodian did not operate to defeat the commonwealth's escheatage. Also, the court found that a statute of limitations provided a procedural limitation but did not deal with substantive rights. The court discharged the petition for a rule to show cause why the proceeding should not be dismissed, concluding that the defense of the statute of limitations was not properly before the court.</SPAN></P>

The Fiduciaries Act provided that in cases where one person fulfilled the duties of executor and trustee, the person was not to receive more than one commission. The trustee's acceptance of the trust was not as of the date of death of the decedent or upon probate of the will, or even as of the date when commissions were received, but was of the date when the corpus of the trust was actually received by the trustee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sidewalks were originally constructed in front of the property belonging to plaintiffs and other abutting property owners under an agreement whereby the property owners paid for materials and the WPA (Pennsylvania) supplied the labor. Subsequently, other abutting property owners, entirely at their own expense, constructed sidewalks parallel with and contiguous to those built with WPA aid. Some years later, the township entered into an agreement with the Department for the construction of new sidewalks. The new sidewalk construction was to be accomplished on the property of every abutting owner where a sidewalk had previously existed and on some additional property. Property owners that constructed their own original sidewalks were exonerated under a township ordinance from payment of an assessment for the new sidewalks. The court entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs. The ordinance in question violated the tax uniformity provision of Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1. All property owners who had sidewalks were in exactly the same position when the new construction was undertaken. All had sidewalks that were temporary in nature. Taxpayers in the same circumstances had to be taxed alike.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners applied for a 20 percent reduction in their assessed tax on machinery pursuant to 1957 Pa. P.L. 954. The Board denied the request and the property owners filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the reduction. The Board filed preliminary objections. The court denied the objections and granted the mandamus relief. It found that the Board's assessment which assessed 100 percent of the assessed valuation was without warrant of law and that the relief sought by the property owners was not within the discretionary power of the Board to review on appeal. Once the board admitted that it had not given the 20 percent reduction, and once it was conceded that the 20 percent reduction was not within the discretionary power of the Board to refuse, the property owners, who had a direct interest, could bypass an appealing to the board and could pursue mandamus relief. Mandamus relief was warranted because the property owners showed the existence of a legal duty on the part of the Board to do the act requested; the existence of the property owner's interest in the result; the absence of any other adequate remedy at law; and an antecedent demand and refusal.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the Act was not passed in furtherance of one religion over another, and had not become vague and discriminatory. The court ruled that statutes permitting conduct on Sunday otherwise prohibited by the Act did not prejudice defendants because none concerned any field of employment related to that of defendants and none were inconsistent with the preservation of a prescribed period of cessation from labor. The court noted that it could not inquire into the district attorney's motives in aiding in prosecution of some violators and not in all possible prosecutions, and that such motive was no defense to a clear violation of the law.

The question before the court was whether a turkey shoot was prohibited under the Act of Assembly of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, &sect; 699.4 (Pennsylvania). The Act forbade any game, hunting, shooting, or sport on Sunday, unless otherwise allowed by law. In defendant's case a turkey shoot was publicly advertised; some 50 or 60 persons gathered together for the affair. The usual turkey shoot was a contest where the participants shot at targets and the winners were rewarded with a turkey for a prize. Under all of the facts in the case the court ruled that a turkey shoot as participated in by defendant was a shooting as contemplated by the Act and as such was prohibited by the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner trustees sought an adjudication of their account of a trust. Respondent income beneficiary and respondent guardian and trustee ad litem for the trust principal each filed two objections to the account.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The income beneficiary complained that the trustees failed to apportion to income shares of common corporate stock acquired in a stock split. The trustees' account carried the shares in principal. The income beneficiary also complained that the trustees failed to apportion the proceeds of sales of common stock to income when they apportioned the entire proceeds as principal. He claimed that the proceeds of sale were apportionable to income to the extent that they represented undistributed corporate earnings applicable to such shares which earnings were accumulated from the date of the creation of the trust to the dates of sale. The guardian and trustee ad litem complained of the inclusion in the principal disbursements to the life beneficiary that were loans of cash and shares. The court held that the proceeds from the sale of the stock that had been split were apportionable to the principal as there was no capitalization of earnings of the split stock and the transaction was a pure stock split. The income beneficiary was not entitled to the accumulated earnings of the corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that all distributions due the income beneficiary as a result of the apportionment be withheld until he gave immediate adequate security for the amount of prior loans from principal. The trustees were directed to collect the cash advanced and the shares of stock loaned within 90 days of the final adjudication. The fees awarded to the guardian ad litem and to the trustees were to be borne equally by principal and income.</SPAN></P>

Defendants filed a rule to show cause why judgment should not be arrested. They claimed that the &sect; 415 of the Penal Code violated the right to free speech embodied in U.S. Const. amend. I, and the right to freedom of the press of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. They also claimed that the statute was violative of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court discharged the rule. The court held that the statute did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV because there was nothing vague or indefinite about the statute since there was no doubt it was proper to the legislature to provide that the publication of anonymous writing that maligned a politician's personal character or political actions was actionable. The statute did not violate the Freedom of Speech because the statute was a libel statute for which there was no guarantee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner contended that, although the was the record owner of the land and was listed on the tax rolls as the owner, not notice was sent to him regarding a sale of the land for unpaid taxes and that he did not know about the sale until after the purchaser had acquired his treasurer's deed. The court determined that no notice was sent to the landowner by the treasurer, but the treasurer had instead sent notice to the landowner's grantor. The court held that the failure of the treasurer to notify the landowner of the sale violated the requirements of the Pennsylvania Act of May 29, 1931 (1931 P.L. 280, &sect; 7, as amended (Pa. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the entry of a temporary restraining order by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, defendant prosecutor filed preliminary objections to plaintiff company's complaint, which sought to enjoin the prosecutor from interfering with the company's exhibition of a certain motion picture and claimed that the obscenity statute, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4528 (1939), was facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company was the owner of the exhibition rights to a certain film and its complaint alleged that the prosecutor had threatened to arrest anyone showing the film in the company's public theaters. The prosecutor responded, inter alia, that the complaint failed to state a cause of action and the company had an adequate remedy at law. In sustaining these objections and denying injunctive relief, the court ruled that the entry of a temporary restraining order by the supreme court was not an adjudication that the complaint stated a cause of action. The obscenity statute did not violate procedural due process or freedom of expression, and the facts alleged by the company did not indicate that the prosecutor had attempted to establish impermissible precensorship. There was no constitutional right to exhibit an obscene film, and whether the film was obscene was a question of fact for a jury in a criminal prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The preliminary objections were sustained and the complaint was initially dismissed, but a reargument on the merits was ordered after an appeal, and the application for injunctive relief was then denied on the merits.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed one defendant's conviction on the ground that the evidence showed that his truck was not overweight. The court affirmed the conviction of the other defendant, whose truck was overweight. The court ruled that the statute was a constitutional exercise of the Commonwealth's police power. The court held that the right to use the highways was not unrestricted. The Commonwealth could pass legislation that was designed to promote safety and to promote the free movement of traffic. The court held that the statute in question was passed for both of those purposes. Reasonable restrictions on the weight and size of vehicles traveling on highways was a valid exercise of police power and was equally applicable to intrastate and interstate traffic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company entered into reinsurance contracts with foreign insurance companies. The lower court held that the company was taxable for proceeds on these contracts. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. It agreed with the company that the Tax on Contracts with Unauthorized Companies Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect;&sect; 2265-2266 (1917) could not have been construed to have imposed a tax on the making of contracts for reinsurance with insurance companies that were not authorized to do business in Pennsylvania. It noted that the Act was intended to protect the revenue when the Commonwealth taxed reinsurance premiums. The statutes should thus have been construed to avoid imposing tax on the making of reinsurance contracts when loss of revenue was no longer involved. The court determined that because there was now no tax imposed on premiums received for reinsurance by domestic or foreign insurance companies which were registered and authorized to do business in Pennsylvania, there remained no valid basis upon which the tax imposed by the Act could have been computed, insofar as it related to the percentum tax imposed on premiums received for reinsurance in the instant case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife argued that the driver's motions for judgment of non-pros and for judgment on the pleadings should be denied. The court disagreed and ordered that depositions be taken to determine if the husband and wife's delay in filing was barred by the statute of limitations. They argued that the statute had been tolled because of the driver's military service. The court noted that the Act of 1861 said, &quot;no civil process would issue&quot; against any person in the service of the United States. That provision made the issuance of the original summons void and nugatory. If the statute had been tolled by the driver's entry into the military service, there remained 11 months and 10 days of the two-year period to run after his discharge. This period expired, allowing for the additional 30 days after discharge. The court found that the husband and wife could not have, on the one hand, claimed that the summons was good and therefore tolled the statute, and at the same time taken advantage of an act that declared that process would not have issued, thus vitiating their summons. The court thus ordered that depositions be taken to reveal whether there was a valid cause for the delay.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was no unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the court of quarter sessions. Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 11 conferred upon the court of quarter sessions exclusive jurisdiction to grant or refuse a petition to divide an election district into one or more separate districts. The court found that the statute set forth definite standards, policies, and limitations that had to be met.

Before the court were the prothonotary's preliminary objections to the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The litigant filed a complaint in trespass, which was tried by a justice of the peace. Upon an adverse decision, he sought appeal. The prothonotary refused to enter the transcript on his docket, asserting that under the Act of May 17, 1956, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 42, &sect; 913(a) there could be no appeal of a judgment under $ 100 except by petition to the court of common pleas. The litigant contended that the act violated Pa. Const. art. 1, &sect; 6, which provided that the right to a trial by jury was to remain inviolate. The court overruled the prothonotary's preliminary objections. First, the court held that an action in mandamus was a proper vehicle to challenge the constitutionality of the statute. Secondly, the court found that the action of filing the transcript was purely ministerial and thus subject to a complaint in mandamus. Thirdly, the court agreed with the litigant that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 42, &sect; 913(a) was unconstitutional in that it placed an unreasonable restriction on the right to a trial by jury. Under the statute, the right to a jury trial in such cases became a matter of discretion with common pleas courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled the prothonotary's preliminary objections to the complaint and granted him leave to file an answer within 20 days after receipt of notice of the entry of the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The churches alleged that four of the five conditions set forth under the Act of June 25, 1913, P. L. 551, Pa.

Vacating the burial ground, the court held that &sect;&sect; 48, 49 disclosed five separate conditions under which it had jurisdiction to decree the vacation of a burial ground and authorize its sale. The evidence presented fully satisfied four of the conditions: by reason of the growth of the municipality as well as for sanitary purposes, it was deemed necessary or desirable, in the opinion of the churches, to change the location; the interest of public health permitted the interment of the dead; the cemetery had ceased to be used for interments and had become so neglected as to become a public nuisance; and the remains of the bodies interred in the neglected or disused cemetery interfered with and hindered the improvements, extension, and general progressive interest of the city.</SPAN></P>

There was no evidence that the building in which defendant's animals were housed was kept in an unsanitary manner. The keeping and maintaining of the chickens, rabbits, and horses in the borough was not a nuisance per se. Sustaining the appeal, the court held that the ordinance, insofar as it prohibited the keeping of chickens, rabbits, and horses within the borough, was unreasonable, arbitrary, prohibitive, was not a regulation necessary for the comfort, convenience, and safety of the residents of the borough, and was, therefore, to that extent unconstitutional and void. The borough had no power to arbitrarily prohibit the maintaining of a slaughter house or the keeping of horses, chickens or rabbits in the borough, as a statute gave it no such power. The evidence did not indicate that defendant's slaughter house was maintained or the chickens or rabbits kept and slaughtered and dressed in an unsanitary manner, nor that they were in any way detrimental to the health, safety, comfort, morals, or welfare of the community.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the City of Monessen, filed an action against defendant, the Rostraver Township School District. The parties sought a determination as to whether both the City and the School District were permitted to levy one percent wage taxes on the residents of areas that were annexed by the City but remained a part of the School District under Act of June 25, 1947, P. L. 1145 (Pennsylvania).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City annexed two portions of the Township of Rostraver, which was where the School District was located. It was decreed that the annexed areas were to remain a part of the School District. At the time of the annexation, both the School District and the City had levied a one percent wage tax on the residents of their respective municipalities. The issue was whether or not both the City and the School District were permitted to levy one percent wage taxes on the residents of the areas or whether the moneys collected by the special tax collector of the Township, which was being held in escrow, should be divided equally between the City and the Township. The court held that pursuant to the Act of June 25, 1947, P. L. 1145 (Pennsylvania), no more than a one percent tax could be levied on the residents of the area. The levying of the tax by both the city and School District would have resulted in the people of the area paying more taxes than the people in other sections of the same municipalities, which would have been unconstitutional. Thus, the amounts at issue collected by the special tax collector were to be divided equally between the City and the School District.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a justice of the peace (Pennsylvania) for failing to comply with the terms of township ordinance that regulated soliciting and peddling with the township and required such solicitors and peddlers to obtain a license. Defendant appealed the conviction, and a hearing de novo was had by the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was an employee and divisional sales manager of a corporation. Defendant, in the furtherance of the corporation's business, was attempting to obtain orders for the sale of nursery stock, which was not ready for immediate delivery. Defendant did not contend that his conduct did not violate the ordinance but attacked the ordinance itself. First, the court held that the ordinance did not constitute an unreasonable and unconstitutional interference with, and burden upon, interstate commerce in which defendant was admittedly engaged. The ordinance was a legitimate exercise of the township's police power. Second, the court rejected defendant's contention that the yearly license fee was unreasonable. It was clear that in addition to the clerical work imposed upon the chief of police or his designated subordinate, the infiltration into the local community of strangers, in considerable number, naturally augmented and increased the duties of the police force. Finally, the court found that the regulation of peddlers and solicitors fell within such an area of public safety that the township could enforce reasonable ordinances to protect its residents and citizens.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court adjudged and found defendant to be guilty of violating the ordinance and directed him to pay a fine and the costs of prosecution.</SPAN></P>

A preliminary injunction was entered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance declared certain structures to be nuisances and ordered their abatement after notice was given to the owners. The owner received from a sanitary officer and a building officer a letter stating that his dwelling house was a &quot;public nuisance&quot; and that it was to be abated and removed. The ordinance provided for no hearing. Instead of an appeal before a court, the ordinance provided for a penalty section that could amount to a $ 5,200 fine in a year or 14 months imprisonment. The court ruled that the ordinance was void and a violation of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9's prohibition against depriving a citizen of property, except by the judgment of his peers or the law of the land. The law of the land, ruled the court, implied notice and the right to appeal and answer a remedy. The court ruled that the ordinance was also invalid because it was unreasonable. The ordinance condemned any structure that was not fit for human habitation. The court ruled, however, that a secure structure that was not an infringement upon the public safety, and was not a nuisance, could not be made one by legislative fiat, and then prohibited. The ordinance was vague, indefinite, and uncertain.</SPAN></P>

The justice of the peace passed upon the conflicting facts after seeing and hearing the parties and their witnesses testify. There was no objection to the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace, the action being one of direct trespass, and not trespass on the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board refused appellants a variance to open a funeral home. They appealed. The trial court affirmed, and appellants filed exceptions before the court en banc. The court agreed with the trial court that funeral directing was not a profession, that the property was not subject to a nonconforming use, that there was no provision in the ordinance for a special exception and that there was no unnecessary hardship that would warrant a variance. However, the court found that the reasons for denying a variance, that a funeral home would be depressing, would create a traffic hazard and decrease property values, and that the zoning code provided for funeral homes in business districts, were arbitrary. The court found that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional in that it had no relation to the public good regarding health, safety, and the general welfare, and that it permitted the zoning board the control the details of each case. Thus, because the ordinance permitted a church next to appellants' property, and the Board had allowed variances to a hospital and a shopping center, the neighborhood's character had changed such that appellants should have been allowed their funeral home.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant licensees challenged orders from the Pennsylvania State Athletic Commission, which revoked their respective licenses to act as a manager of boxers after they were cited for alleged violation of the Pennsylvania Athletic Code of August 31, 1955, P.L. 531, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 4, &sect; 30.101.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After finding that the two licensees had violated the Pennsylvania Athletic Code, members of the Commission voted to revoke their respective licenses to act as boxing managers. On appeal, the licensees argued that the words &quot;sham or collusive boxing match&quot; and acts &quot;detrimental to the interests of boxing&quot; were too vague, indefinite and uncertain to be properly enforced, and vested too much discretionary power in the Commission. The court disagreed, concluding that the phrases needed no definition by the legislature and upheld the Code as constitutional. However, the court did note that that there was no evidence in the entire record to support the Commission's findings of fact, especially since the revocation was based upon acts that were suggested by the commissioner of boxing and known to the Commission at the time the managers' licenses were issued. Moreover, all of the things of which the Commission complained were based upon acts that occurred prior to the effective date of the law. The court concluded that the Commission acted contrary to the evidence, that its action revoking the licenses was arbitrary and capricious, and amounted to an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the appeals and directed the Commission to reinstate the two boxers manager's licenses that it had previously revoked.</SPAN></P>

The court denied defendant's request for a special allowance and held that the mere fact that the vehicle was titled in plaintiff's husband's name did not conclusively establish ownership in her husband so as to prohibit her from recovering for damages to the vehicle. The court noted that counsel for plaintiff stated that both plaintiff and her husband would join in a release to defendant. The court also held that it could not grant the special allowance on the ground that defendant was not negligent and plaintiff was contributorily negligent, because the court was not presented with the actual facts that concerned the accident.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. tit. 62, &sect; 1974 (1951), which demanded judgment against the husband and wife for public assistance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department filed a complaint under &sect; 4 of the Support Law in order to recover public assistance payments made to the wife. The husband denied liability on the ground that when the assistance was given to his wife, she had left him without reasonable cause. There was a jury verdict in favor of the Department. The court denied the husband's motions for new trial because there was sufficient evidence to submit the liability issue to the jury and that there was a proper verdict. As to his motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, there was no requirement that the Department had to proceed under &sect; 3 of the Support Law to secure an order of support taking into consideration his financial ability to pay before commencing an action under &sect; 4 of the Support Law, which was essentially an in rem proceeding. The court noted that the 1951 amendments to the Support Law broadened the right of the Commonwealth to reimbursement and eliminated the necessity of proving the husband's ability to pay. The only requirements were that he be liable for the support of the recipient, and that he owned property at the time assistance was given. Finally, &sect; 4 of the Support Law was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

At issue was whether the Act of May 1 (Act), 1953, P.L. 190, applied retroactively with respect to the services of a trustee rendered in a trust created prior to the effect date of the Act. The court acknowledged that a statute was unconstitutional and hence invalid in its retroactive application if such application destroyed a substantial property right. The court concluded, however, that substantial property rights would not be destroyed by retroactive application of the Act. The court reasoned that the payment of compensation was essentially procedural pertaining to trust administration and had no adverse effect upon remaindermen. The estate was required to bear the charge for the trustee's compensation and the remainderman had no cause to complain if part of such compensation was prepaid before the trust terminated. The court held that the life tenants' loss of future income that the amount of interim principal compensation would produce was minor and was but incident to a change in a rule of trust administration.</SPAN></P>

The attorney argued that he only practiced federal law from his office and residence in Philadelphia County. He was listed in the local telephone book as an attorney. The court held that the real point concerned practicing law of any kind and being subject to regulation as to mental and character fitness in the public interest. The right to practice law was not such a privilege or immunity as guaranteed by the U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Rather, the lives, liberty, and property of the public were at stake and a state could attach conditions to an attorney's license aimed at the public's protection. The attorney also contended that the Act of April 28, 1899, 1899 Pa. Laws 117, as amended Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 1608, was unconstitutional.

The senator was elected and the citizens brought a petition contesting the validity of the election under Pa. Stat.

The senator brought a motion to quash the petition contesting the election. The court ruled that a presiding officer could be compelled to issue a writ and set a date for the holding of an election but the court could not substitute its discretion for his in determining what date should be set. Further, the court held that the power to throw out a ballot for irregularities must be exercised very sparingly and with the idea in mind that either an individual voter or a group of voters were not to be disfranchised at an election except for compelling reasons.

The court found that the school districts took title to the property in their names as required by Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 17-1704. The court found the intention of the legislature was to authorize any school district, whether joint or not, to be able to condemn land as set forth in Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 508. The court also rejected the property owners' contention that even if the school district had the authority to condemn the subject property, the authority granting said power did not provide for just compensation being first made or secured and that it was unconstitutional. The court found that each of the joint school districts was pledged for the payment of damages that could be awarded in the condemnation proceedings and the taxing power of each was security for any action to establish or maintain the joint school.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the term &quot;aged&quot; was not so vague a term as to make the statute indefinite. The Commonwealth Department of Welfare, which was responsible for the supervision of commercial boarding houses for the aged, defined an &quot;aged&quot; person as someone over the age of 60. The court held that the department's definition was reasonable. The court rejected the owner's allegations that there was no logical basis for the classification of elderly people and that the statute was an unlawful exercise of the Commonwealth's police power. The court held that the concern for the protection and safety of elderly persons was a valid exercise of the Commonwealth's police powers. The court further held that the statute did not deprive the owner of her property without due process in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The owner was entitled to resort to mandamus proceedings if a license was unreasonably withheld from her.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued a permanent injunction to restrain the owner from operating and maintaining a commercial boarding home for the aged without a license.

In the court's opinion this was largely a moot question, because the stipulation expressly provided that no question of negligence on the part of either party was involved in the case. For the purposes of this suit, the landslide was caused solely by forces of nature, and not by the failure of either party in its duty to maintain and support the hillside.</SPAN></P>

The owners alleged that the water contained earth, silt, mud, dirt and debris, which caused the lake adjoining their property to be discolored, contaminated and polluted. The court held that the damages were not consequential because they were not the result of an act lawfully done by another. They were the direct result of an act unlawfully done by an agent of the turnpike commission, in the execution of its plan of construction of the turnpike. The court held that the damages might have been better termed &quot;resultant damages.&quot; The court held that they were the direct result of a willful and deliberate illegal act done at the direction of the turnpike commission.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the jury found him guilty of the other charges. He filed a motion in arrest of judgment, alleging that, as to the loitering and prowling charge, the act that created the offense was unconstitutional because it failed to lay down a reasonably ascertainable standard of conduct. Defendant also alleged that the indictment was fatally defective because it failed to allege that he &quot;maliciously&quot; committed the act. The court refused in part the motion, by holding that the language in 18 Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect;&sect; 4418, provided an adequate warning as to what conduct fell under its ban. The court also held that the indictment was proper because it set forth the offense sufficiently to apprise defendant of the offense, so that he could properly defend, and it was such that the trial court could give proper judgment thereon.</SPAN></P>

It was conclusively shown that the pigeon in question was roosting on the roof of defendant's home at the time it was shot.

Defendant had warned the individual that unless he kept his pigeons off his land and home, he would be compelled to shoot the pigeons as a matter of protection of his own property. The court held the defendant's motion to quash the information on the ground that &sect; 950 of the Penal Code, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4950, was unconstitutional was properly denied. However, the court held that defendant was justified in killing the pigeon because it was the only way available to defendant to protect his property from further contamination of his water from pigeon droppings to such an extent that it gave off an unusual odor and was unfit for use.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants contended on appeal that they had not made sales under a plan of subdivision.

The court observed that there had been no showing that any such subdivision plan existed, let alone was used in the sales and transfers in question. The court stated that recitals mentioning a survey merely demonstrated that a surveyor's description was prepared on a particular date in each case to render certain the lines of the land transferred or the driveway referred to in each transaction and did not necessarily, or even by fair implication, prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendants had a &quot;plan of subdivision&quot; or that the several pieces of land in question were sold and transferred by reference to, or exhibition of, or by other use of a plan of a subdivision.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the record did not disclose that the arresting officer, at the time of the arrest of the defendant, was in uniform. The court reasoned that defendant had entered a plea of guilty to the violation as charged before the justice of the peace and then obtained a writ of certiorari. The court held that the plea of guilty by defendant was a waiver of his right thereafter to raise any question concerning the irregularity of or infirmity in his arrest, or the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace as to his person. The court held that it was concerned with the question of whether the justice of the peace had jurisdiction of the person of defendant. Such jurisdiction was obtained by the justice of the peace when defendant entered his plea of guilty to the offense as charged. The court further rejected defendant's contention that the record did not disclose that he was given an opportunity of giving bail for a later hearing, which was fatal to the proceeding.

The erotic allurement of a book was measured by whether it was sexually impure, pornographic, or a calculated incitement to sexual desire. In addition, there had to be a reasonable and demonstrable cause to believe that a crime or misdemeanor had been committed or was about to be committed as the perceptible result of the publication. Nudity was not, per se, obscene. The court held that the pictures in question did not display any part of the male or female genital area. There was a display of nudity but with no additional aspect of indecency. On this basis, the court found that the magazines in question were not obscene.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was a foreign corporation. The Commonwealth assessed a franchise tax against the taxpayer business within the Commonwealth. The taxpayer sought review of a the settlement of one year's franchise tax. The Board declined to review the settlement. On appeal, the court dismissed the taxpayer's appeal and entered a judgment for the tax and costs. The court noted that the taxable value of a franchise had to have some relation to the business done in the taxing Commonwealth. The property without the Commonwealth could be taken into consideration only if it was an organic or functional part of that within the state. Furthermore, in imposing a franchise tax where the business was unitary, the Commonwealth could look beyond its borders to get the true value of the things within it, when they were part of an organic system of wide extent. The court found that the taxpayer was a unitary business enterprise, the Commonwealth's auditor's properly measured the tax based upon the taxpayer's capital stock, and the Board had properly declined review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district attorney filed an information before the magistrate charging the accused with extortion and other crimes. The accused claimed to have had absolute proof that the magistrate said the accused was guilty, even before the hearing. The accused asked for a rule to show cause why a writ of prohibition should not issue to prevent the magistrate from presiding, requesting that the information be filed before any other justice of the peace in the county. Recognizing that the constitutional rights of the accused were involved, the court signed the order granting the rule. After a hearing, the court discharged the rule. The court held that the court of common pleas did not have jurisdiction to issue writs of prohibition directed to aldermen, magistrates, and justices of the peace in criminal matters. The court recognized the power of the common pleas courts to issue writs of prohibition over quasi-judicial tribunals under its jurisdiction, but nowhere in the Pennsylvania Constitution or statutes was the minor judiciary considered a judicial agency subject to the jurisdiction of the common pleas court.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was indicted upon a state charge of the possession of coining tools. In his motion to quash the indictment, defendant contended that a state court lacked jurisdiction to prosecute crimes that involved counterfeiting or the possession of counterfeiting equipment. The court agreed. The court pointed out that the offense of producing a false representation of a government coin had been distinguished from the passing of it. The creation of the coin was an offense directly against the federal government. The passing of such coin was a private wrong in which the federal government may be remotely interested but not to the extent that it could prevent the states from enacting a statute against the passing of such spurious coins to the detriment of its citizens. Thus, the jurisdiction of the federal courts to prosecute for possession of counterfeiting equipment intended to be used to manufacture spurious coins was exclusive, and Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 5006, insofar as it attempted to give concurrent jurisdiction, was superseded by 18 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 488, 489 and to that extent was unconstitutional and inoperative.</SPAN></P>

L. 453, and &sect; 677.1 of the Public School Code of March 10, 1949, P. L. 30 (acts). The township and the school district of the same township intervened with leave of court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subordinate assessor made an unfinished assessment of the premises and the county Board of Assessment and Revision of Taxes certified the assessment to the township and school district. The township and school district thereupon made levy upon the real estate for the taxes due based on the assessment. The erection of a commercial structure was completed on the property during the tax year. The property was reassessed for the remaining part of the tax year pursuant to the acts. The court found that the budget of neither the township nor the school district contained projected receipts from anticipated taxes to be collected under the amendatory acts and that the taxes to be collected thereunder, therefore, were not earmarked for any new appropriation. The court determined that levy was illegal because it was not for any specified municipal purpose. The court also held that the acts were vague, indefinite and ambiguous because they did not define what constituted a &quot;major improvement&quot; allowing the reassessment and did not did not expressly provide for a right of appeal. Finally, the court concluded that the acts violated the uniformity requirements of Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company was authorized to do business in Pennsylvania as an interstate motor carrier of passengers and freight for hire. The company contended that it was improperly assessed a portion of its excise tax based upon revenue from its transportation of military and federal government personnel. The company contended that under the doctrine of implied immunity in the United States Constitution, means and instrumentalities employed by the federal government to carry on its constitutional powers were immune from State taxation. In dismissing the appeal, the court ruled that implied immunity had no application because the State of Pennsylvania was permitted to levy taxes for the use of its highways. The purpose of the tax was to reflect the use of the highways and to assess a tax based upon that use. The gross receipts derived from the transportation of governmental personnel was only one of the elements used to reflect that use. The tax was not imposed on the receipts from transportation of governmental personnel as such. States were not precluded from enacting legislation that affected interstate commerce. The impact of the tax on the federal government was indirect and remote.</SPAN></P>

L. 289, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 2851-311.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating a parking regulation of a private, non-profit corporation formed to maintain housing for its members. The violation was prosecuted as a criminal offense pursuant to the Act of May 5, 1933, P. L. 289, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 2851-311. The Act gave any nonprofit corporation that maintained buildings open to the public to adopt and enforce rules necessary for maintaining peace and order in such buildings and to secure the safety and protection of the corporation's property. On review, the court noted that the Act provided no legislative guidelines on the delegation of such power, which to be valid at all had to be subject to very strict and specific guidelines, and gave the corporation unfettered discretion in enacting its own criminal code. The Act gave private property owners the power to enact and enforce their own criminal laws, a result that was both absurd and unconstitutional. In addition, the buildings and grounds of the private housing corporation were not &quot;open to the public,&quot; and the parking regulation was not necessary to secure the safety and protection of the property.

The builder petitioned for the allowance of an appeal. The court discharged the rule and refused the appeal. All the facts were admitted and uncontradicted. Therefore, the builder could secure an appeal only upon affirmatively showing that the magistrate disregarded the law or that a doubtful legal question or a constitutional question was involved. The court held that the provisions of the zoning ordinance were clear, certain, and free from doubt. Without notification of completion of an authorized construction, it would have been impossible to determine whether the structure was safe and sanitary for human occupation. Thus, by necessary implication, the use permit was sanctioned by the Enabling Act of 1949, First Class Township Code (Pennsylvania), and was a necessary feature of an effective zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City claimed that the policeman was not entitled to compensation because the Act of June 28, 1935 (Pennsylvania), P.

The City further claimed that the Act of June 28, 1935 had been superseded by Philadelphia, Pa., Civil Service Regulation 32, which was promulgated in accordance with the Philadelphia, Pa., Home Rule Charter. The court sustained the preliminary objection and dismissed the policeman's action. The court found that the superseding effect of the Home Rule Charter was established by &sect; 11 of the First Class City Home Rule Act (Pennsylvania), 53 PS &sect; 3421.11.

However, prepayments of contributions for the fourth quarter of 1955 made in December of 1955 could not properly be added to the Fund balance for the year ending December 31, 1955. There was no abuse of discretion on the part of the officials charged with the administration of the Unemployment Compensation Law in refusing to accept and credit to the fund balance as of December 31, 1955 checks totaling over five million dollars, forwarded to them in December as contributions to be paid on 1955 wages.</SPAN></P>

Laws 512, &sect; 983(7). The gravamen of the petition was that equity and justice required a review since the petitioner did not file exceptions or claim for apportionment at the second account in view of the provisions of two statutes that were in effect at the time but which were subsequently declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania as applied retroactively to trusts created prior to their enactment. The trust in question was created prior. It was conceded that the relevant assets were still in the hands of the trustees and no distribution had been made of them. The court determined that the petition to review should not be allowed because the petitioner was guilty of laches and for the further reasons that (1) the petitioner failed to allege any facts that were not available when the second account was audited; and (2) the petitioner did not allege that there existed mistakes of fact or of law apparent on the record itself. The petitioner failed to assign any satisfactory reason for the delay in filing his petition.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. tit. 4, &sect; 11 relating to &quot;sham or collusive exhibitions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A boxing match took place that involved a boxer who was allegedly too sick to effectively participate. The Commission determined that this was a &quot;sham&quot; match and that the manager knew of the sham. Based on this, the Commission determined that the manager had violated &sect; 14 of the Act of June 14, 1923, P.L. 710, as amended, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 4, &sect; 11 and suspended the manager's license for a period of six months. The manager sought review, claiming that the Act was unconstitutional and that he was not in violation of the Act. The court held that, in order for the Act to be unconstitutional, the manager had to show that it was vague. The court found that a &quot;sham&quot; boxing match was one understood by a reasonably intelligent person, making the Act constitutional. The court further determined that the manager's own testimony that he observed the boxer in his dressing room prior to the match and observed his level of illness was sufficient for the Commission to find that he had violated the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tea company instituted an action in trespass against the transportation company.

The transportation company appealed, and on that same date notified counsel for the tea company by letter that the transportation company was going to make a claim for damages to their bus by either an original action or by asserting a counterclaim in the action. The tea company did not object to the procedure of bringing it by counterclaim so the transportation company did this. The case was heard by a jury which returned its verdict in favor of the transportation company and against the tea company on the counterclaim. The matter then came before the court on the tea company's motion for an arrest of judgment for the reason that the counterclaim was submitted to trial by a jury without prior submission to arbitration. The court held that it was too late--after the jury trial--for the tea company to object for the reason that the counterclaim was not first arbitrated.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that representatives of the police department and the bureau of traffic engineering approved the application and testified that the lot would improve traffic conditions in the area. The court also determined that there evidence did not support the board's finding that there was &quot;substantial protest&quot; to the application in the surrounding area, noting that one protestant appeared before the board and that no protestants appeared before the court. Further, the court concluded that there was no showing that the lot would adversely affect the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the residents of the area.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a suit in trespass against defendant and the matter was submitted to the board of arbitrators. They filed an award granting defendant's motion for compulsory nonsuit; however, the matter was referred back to the arbitrators to amend the award because they lacked the power to enter a nonsuit. Without taking further testimony, the arbitrators entered an award for defendant. Plaintiff then sought to strike off the award. The court denied the prayer to strike off the award, but granted alternate relief referring the matter back to the arbitrators to take further testimony. It noted that to discharge their duties under the Act, the arbitrators had to either hear all parties or at least afford an opportunity to hear the testimony of all parties. Further, while a litigant was not required to testify if his opponent did not insist on it, every litigant had to at least make his testimony available. In the instant case, even though the award stated that the arbitrators heard the evidence and allegations of the parties, that was not done. Instead, when the matter was referred back to the arbitrators, no further testimony was taken before they entered an award for defendant.</SPAN></P>

The township brought a petition to abate a nuisance against the landowners alleging that the landowners were operating and conducting a business of storing junk automobiles on property in the township. The court ruled that the legislature gave to townships the power to prohibit nuisances, including the storage of abandoned or junked automobiles. Further, the court held that it was clear that the legislature declared automobile graveyards, as they were commonly called, to be nuisances. Also, the court found that despite the fact that automobile graveyards did constitute a source of scrap metal and used automobile parts for other industries, the court could not say that the township exceeded the constitutional exercise of its police power by its enactment of the ordinance. The court granted a permanent injunction restraining the landowners from storing junk automobiles on the property in the township, concluding that the landowners were clearly violating the ordinance in question.</SPAN></P>

Neither the 1935 act, nor the 1951 amendment made allowances for death claims, but only allowed for disability claims. If the legislature had intended to apply the act's separate compensation schedule for death due to heart and lung cases it should have said so explicitly. Under the Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937; 1937 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supervisors of the township by ordinance rezoned approximately 60 acres of land. Several adjacent or nearby landowners (landowners) filed a complaint in equity seeking to have the ordinance declared illegal. The township filed motions to dismiss the proceedings in equity on the ground that equity had no jurisdiction. The court agreed and dismissed the proceedings. The court rejected the landowners' claim that they had not remedy available to them because they had to wait until a building permit was issued for industrial construction in the rezoned tract. In the meantime they asserted the value of their properties was depreciated. In other words, they argued that they were without any remedy at the present time. The court pointed out that depreciation in the value of real estate standing alone was not a sufficient reason for declaring a zoning ordinance unconstitutional. The court pointed out that if a property owner desired to test the constitutionality or validity otherwise of zoning regulations, application to the Board of Adjustment, in the first instance, for relief, followed by an appeal to the common pleas from the Board's denial of relief, was the proper form.</SPAN></P>

Adjacent to defendant's plant was a group of dwelling houses. The residents complained of noxious and offensive smoke, fumes, and gases emanating from the plant. The issues before the court related to the validity of the ordinance, the sufficiency of the evidence, and the propriety of the trial judge's rulings on the evidence. Defendant contended that the ordinance was fatally indefinite, vague and uncertain. The court upheld defendant's conviction. The ordinance was not uncertain merely because it used the word &quot;offensive.&quot; The Commonwealth's evidence was clear, convincing, and uncontroverted. The evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant's use and operation of its plant resulted in the creation of noxious, offensive, and corrosive fumes, gas, smoke and odors, dangerous to public health, safety, comfort, and cleanliness. Criminal intent was not a necessary ingredient of the offense defined by the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs claimed that the ordinance violated the property clauses of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 9, and 17 and the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court found that the regulation of the signs for the purpose of preventing unsightly advertising was within the legislative domain of the city. The city had an interest in maintaining the symbols of the historic past. The mall area in question was designated as an historic area. Moreover, because the council could legislate in the area in question, it was clear that the art commission was the agency in reason to be vested with the power because it oversaw the cultural and artistic features of public property. The legislature was not required to spell out precisely the nature of the power delegated, especially where the subject matter admitted of no precise definition.</SPAN></P>

L. 872, &sect; 506, as adopted by the Pennsylvania legislature by the Pa. Act of September 28, 1951, P. L. 1543, &sect; 1, was prospective in its application. The court noted that no law was construed to be retroactive unless clearly intended. Where the language of a statute was so general and might be given both retroactive and prospective operation, it was held prospective only. The court concluded that the order of the court for maintenance of the child in cases of fornication and bastardy was considered as part of the sentence and the court did not have the power, after the term in a criminal proceeding, without statutory authority, to grant a new order or to alter or amend the original order. The court further found that if the 1951 amendment to the Act could be construed as retroactive, it was unconstitutional insofar as affecting orders in fornication and bastardy cases made prior to its effective date.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the ordinance was void because it: (1) was vague, indefinite and uncertain; (2) went beyond the powers conferred on city council to abate nuisances in that there was no notice to an owner and there was no opportunity for an owner to be heard, and (3) was unconstitutional because it denied the essential elements of due process, namely, notice and an opportunity to be heard.

The court held that it was only by attributing the disability to the exposure during employment that both requirements for fixing responsibility on the employer could have been met.

They contended that in the light of changes of public policy, the Civil War amendments, intervening Acts of Assembly and decisional law, the will needed to be construed elliptically. The hearing judge refused to delete the restriction. Upon review, the court rejected the contention that without integration the students could not be properly instructed. The court held that the operation of the trust was not state action. The administration of the trust did not come within the realm of state action forbidden by the 14th Amendment. The testator's private conduct in creating a school for white orphan boys was constitutional, no matter how discriminatory or wrongful.

The owner of the diner received a percentage of the gross receipts from the juke box. The taxpayer sought to restrict the City from enforcing its Admission Tax Ordinance of 1954 on the basis that it was unconstitutional and void. The court refused the injunction because the taxpayer's activities were taxable under the City's general grant of power to tax pursuant to &sect; 1 of the Act of June 25, 1947, P. L. 1145 (Pennsylvania), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 2015.1, which authorized the levy of a tax on persons, transactions, occupations, privileges, subjects, and personal property. The court found that a juke box was not a place of amusement even though the City described a juke box as such to take the subject out of the general prohibition of the Act of June 25, 1947 (Pennsylvania).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The testamentary trust gave the income to a life beneficiary with the remainder to other beneficiaries. The trustees managed the trust. Several corporations, whose stock comprised part of the corpus of the trust, made unusual stock distributions. The trustees apportioned the distributions between the life tenant and the remaindermen. The trustee ad litem filed exceptions to the trustees' accounting. The court sustained some of the exceptions. The life beneficiary's acceptance of income without objection was not acquiescence because there was no evidence that the life beneficiary knew of the source of the income or understood its nature. The trustees asked the court to apply the Pennsylvania rule of apportionment to the case. The purchase price of stock bought by the trustees was from the corpus, and the remaindermen were entitled to have that sum preserved and restored to the principal. The court reviewed the stock transactions but disregarded the characterizations given by the corporations. Only those disbursements attributable to earnings required distribution to the life tenant; all other disbursements including stock splits and the sale of subscription rights, were apportioned.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, defendant below, was sentenced in the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace of Montgomery County (Pennsylvania) for violations of the Pennsylvania Liquor Code of Apr. 12, 1951, P. L. 90, i.e., the sale of malt beverages without a license and offering liquor for sale and selling it without a license. A petition for writ of habeas corpus was filed in defendant's behalf contending that the sentences on the convictions were illegal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before sentence was imposed, the district attorney's office represented to the trial judge in open court in the presence of petitioner and his attorney that petitioner previously had been convicted of violations of the same provisions of the Liquor Code. No proof thereof had been introduced at the trial. Petitioner was sentenced based on having the former convictions. The bills of indictment, made under &sect; 494(a) of the Liquor Code, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 47, &sect; 4-494(a), charged petitioner with violations of article 4 of the Liquor Code but not with subsequent violations of its provisions. On the habeas corpus petition, the court stated that the former convictions were essential factors of the crime itself for which petitioner was indicted and for which he was to be punished and those essential factors had to be alleged in the indictment and proved exactly the same way as all other material facts of the case. The court held that in such cases an original indictment, averring the former convictions, was not to be sent out but a copy of it, with that averment omitted, was to be furnished to the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was ordered that petitioner be brought before the court of quarter sessions of the county for resentencing in accordance with the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers filed a bill against the city and county to enjoin the expenditure of public funds for the printing of ballots and other election material for use at a primary election and a general election. The taxpayers argued that the legislation attacked constituted an unreasonable restriction of the right of voters to nominate anyone they chose for public office, whether of one or more political parties. The court noted that the constitution did not specify what rights were guaranteed the people in respect to the exercise of the franchise other than to provide that elections shall have been free and equal; and no power, civil or military, shall at any time have interfered to prevent the free exercise of the right of suffrage. The act in question did not conflict in any manner with this clause. The taxpayers were deprived of no opportunity to elect a particular individual to office, for even though the members of one party were unable to vote for him at the primary because the candidate had filed with another party, they were still at liberty to cast their ballots for him at the general election. Accordingly, the taxpayers' bill was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner raised the question of the jurisdiction of appellee Warrington Township Zoning Board in issuing an enforcement order and the trial judge directed that the subject be argued before the court en banc prior to further proceedings upon the merits after the property owner appealed to the Board from an adverse communication of a zoning officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner had been conducting a mink farm on his premises for some time when a Warrington Township zoning officer advised him by registered mail that such activity on his property was a violation of the Warrington Township Zoning Ordinance of 1952. The officer's letter stated that a grace period of 30 days would be allowed in order that the property owner might cure the violation, after which he would be subject to daily fines. The zoning officer further advised the property owner of his right to appeal the officer's decision to the Board within 30 days. The property owner, without advice of counsel, signed an appeal application form the next day and in due course, after hearings, the Board entered an enforcement order against the property owner. The court determined that the communication from the zoning officer was not in any legal sense the kind of judicial or quasi-judicial act contemplated by &sect; 2007 of the Second Class Township Code, as revised and recodified by the Act of July 10, 1947, 1947 P. L. 1481, as amended, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 19093-2007. It was not for the zoning officer to judge the case. Accordingly, the Board had no jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court en banc declared the entire proceedings of the case before the Zoning Board of Adjustment to be void and of no effect for lack of jurisdiction of the Board to hear the case. The court dismissed the proceedings without prejudice or decision on the merits.</SPAN></P>
