The unjustified seven-year, seven-month delay in the prosecution, which resulted in the loss of a considerable amount of evidence, violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court in and for Collier County (Florida), which convicted defendant on two counts of murder and imposed the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to the imposition of the death penalty for a murder conviction, defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting his statement to authorities. However, the court held that admission of defendant's voluntary statement did not violate his Miranda rights. The court then rejected defendant's contention that the rule of completeness required admission of his out-of-court exculpatory statement because the testimony that defendant sought to admit was part of a separate oral conversation from the testimony that the prosecution had introduced. Because state law did not allow defendant to introduce his own exculpatory hearsay, the court held the trial court properly excluded the statement. However, the court held that the trial court's failure to prepare its written order imposing the death penalty prior to pronouncing judgment orally required remand of the case for imposition of a life sentence. The court reasoned that that preparation of written findings after oral judgment ran the risk that the sentence was not the result of reasoned judgment required by due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mortgage lender sought review of a judgment from the District Court of Appeal (Florida) which reversed a summary judgment for appellant and declared that Fla. Stat. ch. 702.01, requiring severance of counterclaims in mortgage foreclosure actions, was unconstitutional to the extent it conflicted with Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.270(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mortgage lender filed foreclosure actions against appellee borrower. Appellee responded by asserting affirmative defenses and counterclaims, all based on allegations of fraud and misrepresentation. Relying on the mandatory language of Fla. Stat. ch. 702.01 (1987), the trial court granted appellant's motion to sever appellee's counterclaims from the foreclosure action. Appellant then filed a motion for summary judgment claiming that, because the grounds supporting appellee's counterclaims and affirmative defenses were identical, the order severing the counterclaims would be thwarted if the affirmative defenses were not stricken. The trial court agreed and granted summary judgment. The district court reversed, holding that ch. 702.01, to the extent it conflicted with Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.270(b), unconstitutionally infringed upon the state supreme court's power to regulate matters of practice and procedure. The district court further held that the trial court erred when it struck appellee's unrebutted affirmative defenses and granted summary judgment. On review, the court affirmed the district court's holdings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that the statute requiring the severance of counterclaims in mortgage foreclosure actions was unconstitutional to the extent that it conflicted with the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Broward County (Florida), which convicted him of kidnapping and first-degree murder and sentenced him to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted appellant of kidnapping and first-degree murder. The trial judge, finding four aggravating and no mitigating circumstances, sentenced appellant to death. On appeal the court affirmed. The court found sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found premeditation and sufficient evidence to support appellant's conviction on a felony-murder theory. The court held appellant's confessions were admissible even though the victim's body was never found because the state had proved corpus delicti through circumstantial evidence. Finding no fundamental error, the court held that many of appellant's claims of error had not been preserved for appellate review. The court found that the evidence failed to demonstrate the heightened level of premeditation necessary to support the aggravating factor that the murder was committed in a cold, calculated, and premeditated manner. According to the court, the killing most likely resulted from the victim's refusal to have consensual sex with appellant and her resistance when he attempted to force himself upon her. Even striking one of four aggravating factors, the court found that the death sentence was not disproportionate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Affirming, the court found competent, substantial evidence to support appellant's conviction of kidnapping and first-degree murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sought review of a decision of the Fifth District Court of Appeal (Florida) granting summary judgment in favor of respondents and declaring petitioners' ordinance imposing an impact fee on new residential construction to be used for new school facilities to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners initiated a comprehensive study of whether to impose impact fees to finance additional infrastructure required to serve new growth and development. Petitioners then enacted a county ordinance which imposed an impact fee on new construction to help build new school facilities. A decision granting summary judgment to respondent builders was quashed and the constitutionality of the ordinance was upheld upon the severance of an alternative mechanism section. There was a reasonable connection between the need for additional schools and the growth in population that would accompany new development. The fee was designed to provide the capacity to serve the educational needs of all dwelling units. No fee could be collected until substantially all of the population was subject to the ordinance. The payment of the fees was unrelated to school attendance. The alternative mechanism section collided with the constitutional requirement of free public schools. The state constitution did not mandate uniform sources of school funding among the several counties. There was no unlawful delegation of power because the fundamental policy decisions were made by the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the decision and upheld the validity of the ordinance upon the severance of an alternative mechanism section. The ordinance met the first prong of the dual rational nexus test and could have met the second prong. There was no violation of the constitutional imperative of free schools nor any unlawful delegation of power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death by the trial court. When police contacted appellant regarding the victim's disappearance, he waived his Miranda rights, made a series of statements, and led detectives to various scenes involved in the murder. Appellant stated that the victim was going to inform police about the theft of some air conditioners involving appellant. Appellant alleged that another person involved in the theft killed the victim and that appellant's life was threatened if he did not help. Appellant's girlfriend, while acting as a court witness, testified that appellant confessed to murder. The appellate court affirmed the conviction and death sentence because no single act by police or the totality of the circumstances compelled appellant to make inculpatory statements. Appellant voluntarily waived his Miranda rights. The state's impeachment of appellant's girlfriend and the trial court's allowance of his girlfriend as a court witness were harmless error because the evidence of appellant's guilt was overwhelming.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed appellant's first-degree murder conviction and death sentence because there was substantial competent evidence to support conviction and appellant's inculpatory statements were voluntary in consideration of the totality of the circumstances. Also, the trial court's denial of mistrial motion regarding the state's endeavor to elicit testimony of appellant's unrelated criminal charges was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial court's dismissal of murder charges against petitioners on the ground that the defense of self-defense was not available to them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a cocaine purchase gone awry, a drug dealer shot one of the petitioners, who then took the gun from the dealer and shot the dealer. The dealer died, and petitioners were charged with attempted cocaine trafficking and first-degree murder. The trial court granted a pretrial motion in limine ruling that the defense of self-defense was available to petitioners. The trial court then dismissed the murder charges. The district court reversed, then certified the question of whether the defense of self defense was available for a killing that occurred when both the defendant and the decedent were engaged in an attempt to traffic in cocaine, and the decedent was the first to use deadly force. The supreme court answered the question in the affirmative and quashed the district court's decision. The supreme court ruled that the self-defense statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 776.041(1)(1987), required that the felony actually involve the use or threat of physical force or violence against any individual. Because cocaine trafficking did not always involve the use or threat of violence, the supreme court ruled that it was not a forcible felony within the meaning of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court ruled that under a strict interpretation of the self-defense statute, cocaine trafficking was not an excluded forcible felony since it did not always involve the use or threat of violence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. He challenged the judgment and contended, inter alia, that there was insufficient evidence to support premeditated murder and that the evidence failed to support felony murder because the state did not prove armed robbery, the predicate offense for the charge of felony murder. The court held the felony-murder theory was supported by the evidence. Although the trial court had committed some errors, the court found that none of the errors was fundamental, nor did the errors go to the heart of the state's case. Rather, each was ancillary to the facts linking defendant to the crime. The court therefore affirmed the convictions for armed robbery and first-degree murder. However, the sentence of death was vacated and the case remanded to the circuit court for imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment. The court found that there was no evidence in the record that appellant had any intent to kill the victim in order to prevent him from identifying him. The court concluded that the trial court erred in finding that as an aggravating circumstance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court in and for St. Johns County (Florida), which sentenced him to death. Appellant claimed error regarding jury instructions, the trial court's refusal to permit certain expert testimony, its refusal to declare a mistrial, and the abridgment of his right to be free from double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found no error warranting reversal in appellant's resentencing, and affirmed the sentence of death. The court held that appellant had not been entitled to an instruction relating to the relative culpability of an accomplice, because he had put on no evidence that bore on this issue. The court also held that it was not error for the trial court to refuse to give instructions on specific nonstatutory mitigating circumstances, holding that a general instruction regarding such factors did not denigrate their importance. The court held that because appellant had not adduced any evidence of intoxication at trial, it was not error to bar expert testimony of intoxication predicated solely on appellant's statements to the expert. The court found no evidence that the jury was alerted to appellant's prior death sentence by a sign directing them to appellant's resentencing and, therefore, no mistrial was required. The court also held that the reversible error committed by the state at appellant's first sentencing was born of zeal, not a desire to force a mistrial; thus, the resentencing did not amount to double jeopardy under U.S. Const. amend. V or Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's death sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, on death row for murder, argued trial court error in dismissing prospective jurors who felt they could not discharge their duties because of strong feelings about the death penalty. The court disagreed, ruling that appellant waived his right to challenge the excusal of jurors by not objecting to the judge's procedure in weighing their ability to decide the case fairly. Similarly, when appellant failed to object to a felony-murder instruction he could not raise the objection on appeal. It was harmless error for a witness to testify that others at a party attended by appellant, before and after the murder, saw the outline of a gun under appellant's clothing. That appellant was never threatened by the victim supported the death penalty after the trial court found that the murder was calculated and committed without any justification. Moreover, conflicting factual testimony by health professionals as to appellant's competency to stand trial was for trial court resolution, and not subject to being reweighed on appeal. The court concluded that aggravating factors outweighed the mitigator of diminished mental capacity in the imposition of a proportionately correct sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed convicting appellant of murder and sentencing him to death, because failure to object to jury selection procedures and felony-murder instruction at trial barred the raising of these objections on appeal, resolution of conflicting evidence on appellant's competency to stand trial could not be reweighed on appeal, and aggravating factors outweighed the mitigator of diminished mental capacity in court's imposition of sentence.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner offered affidavits averring that his trial counsel did not seek to develop nonstatutory mitigation evidence, and that such evidence would have consisted of petitioner's mental problems and weakness of will, his background of poverty and deprivation, and his abuse of alcohol and drugs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sought review of their convictions of keeping a house of ill fame resorted to for the purpose of prostitution or lewdness, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 796.01 (1987), contending that the term ill fame was impermissibly vague and therefore unconstitutional. On appeal, the lower court's finding that the term ill fame was constitutional was quashed. In support of its ruling, the court held that a statute which did not give people of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what constituted forbidden conduct was vague. The court noted, with respect to the instant case, that the term ill fame might have been sufficiently understandable when the statute was first passed, but was now outdated. The court further found that &sect; 769.01 did not provide an objective standard for differentiating between permitted and prohibited conduct and failed to provide fair notice in language relevant to today's society. Accordingly, &sect; 769.01 was deemed unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court's ruling was quashed, and the convictions were overturned, as the statute which contained the term ill fame did not provide an objective standard for differentiating between permitted and prohibited conduct, and failed to provide fair notice in language relevant to today's society.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following his conviction for first degree murder and sentence to death, appellant sought review and argued that his confession should have been suppressed because it was obtained by coercion. The court held the trial judge properly found that no improper promises were made. Appellant also objected to the admission of the testimony of two witnesses who said they did not immediately report their activities to the police because they were afraid that appellant might harm them or their families. The court held that the testimony should have been limited to rebuttal after the witness's credibility had been attacked, but found that appellant's counsel failed to preserve the point by making appropriate objections. The court held that, in view of the overwhelming evidence of guilt, the admission of the testimony constituted no more than harmless error. Regarding appellant's challenges to his sentence, the court found no error and held the sentence was not disproportionate. The court therefore affirmed the murder conviction and death sentence. However, the court vacated the robbery sentence and remanded for resentencing on that conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the murder conviction and the sentence of death after finding that appellant's allegations of trial court error were either without merit or constituted merely harmless error. The court also affirmed the robbery conviction, but vacated the robbery sentence and remanded for resentencing within the guidelines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original proceeding, petitioner, the Florida Bar, sought to amend the rules regulating attorney advertising.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the state bar, brought a petition to amend the rules regulating attorney advertising. The court held that the proposed rules, with three modifications, could be adopted without violating protected commercial speech principles. In light of the multistate nature of many law firms, the court found that any full-time employee of a law firm should be allowed to be a spokesperson for that firm, even if he or she was not a member of the state bar. As a matter of policy, the court found that a mandatory disclosure for electronic media should not be required, given the other special restrictions on electronic advertising. The court modified the total prohibition of targeted mail advertising to personal injury and wrongful death claimants to prohibiting it earlier than 30 days after an incident. The court held that as modified the proposed rules were reasonable restrictions on the time, place, and manner of legal advertising that decreased the possibility of confusion and deception of the public. The modified proposed rules did not violate the U.S. Const. amend. I commercial free speech doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court approved, as modified, petitioner's proposed rules, because the court found that the modified rules were narrowly tailored to further a substantial governmental interest because they proposed to ensure the truthful dissemination of information by regulating and not prohibiting legal advertising. The court directed that the new rules would become effective January 1, 1991.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's death sentence was vacated on appeal, he was sentenced to death again.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder. The jury recommended and the trial court imposed the death penalty, which was affirmed on appeal. The United States Supreme Court vacated defendant's sentence because the advisory jury was not instructed to consider evidence of nonstatutory mitigating circumstances. On resentencing, the court was instructed to comply with a rule of precedent requiring that a sentencer not be precluded from considering as a mitigating factor any aspect of defendant's character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffered as a basis for a sentence less than death. The trial court held another sentencing proceeding and again sentenced defendant to death in accordance with the jury's recommendation. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court prevented him from presenting mitigating evidence. The court found that the testimony that the trial court rejected was irrelevant and concluded that the trial court's evidentiary rulings satisfied the constitutional requirements as to mitigating evidence. The court rejected defendant's other arguments, which included challenges to findings of aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A death sentence imposed on resentencing was affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner individual argued that Fla.

Petitioner sought a writ of mandamus that required respondent state officers to expunge Fla. Laws ch. 90-209, &sect; 1, an allegedly unconstitutional proviso of the General Appropriations Act, and to ensure that the state financial operations reflected the expungement. The court held that under Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 12, an appropriations bill could not change or amend an existing law on another subject. The court stated that the proviso, Fla. Laws ch. 90-209, &sect; 1, imposed a requirement that was not found in preexisting law. Because imposition of the proviso condition was a result that was forbidden by Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 12, the court held that petitioner was entitled to the writ. Respondents were ordered to expunge the unconstitutional language from Fla. Laws ch. 90-209 and to ensure that the expungement was reflected in the state financial operations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fourth District Court of Appeal (Florida) certified the question of whether a city may be held liable to an owner-developer of a building project under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for the wrongful refusal of the city's chief building officer to withdraw a stop-work order on the project. The district court affirmed a trial court's ruling that respondent city was not responsible under the statute for respondent building officer's conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent building officer issued a stop-work order on petitioners' construction project pending implementation of agreed repairs. After an engineering firm certified that the repairs were complete, respondent building officer refused to lift the order for the next five months. Petitioners sued respondent building officer and city under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The district court affirmed the trial court's ruling that respondent city was not liable under the statute for respondent building officer's conduct, then certified the question of whether a municipality may be held liable to an owner-developer of a building project under 42 U.S.C.S &sect; 1983 for the wrongful refusal of the municipality's chief building officer to withdraw a stop-work order on the project. On review, the court answered the certified question in the negative and approved the district court's decision. The court ruled that no liability attached to respondent city because respondent building officer did not have policy-making authority. The court noted that a decision by respondent building official affecting a stop-work order was not final because it was subject to review by the county board of rules and appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court answered the certified question in the negative and approved the district court's decision. The supreme court ruled that respondent city was not liable for respondent building officer's wrongful actions because he was not acting pursuant to an official government policy and only had authority to make discretionary decisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Broward County Circuit Court (Florida) convicting him of first-degree murder and sentencing him to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, appellant argued that a witness's photo-lineup identification of him should have been suppressed because his photo was different from the other five in unduly suggestive ways and that it was error to exclude a psychiatrist's opinion regarding the eyewitness-identification process. The supreme court affirmed. The supreme court ruled that there was nothing unduly suggestive about the photo-lineup warranting exclusion. The supreme court also ruled that the witness's identification was accompanied by an indicia of reliability because the witness had the opportunity to view appellant directly beside him during the crime and made an almost instantaneous identification within one month of the incident. Moreover, the supreme court ruled that the trial court did not err in excluding the psychiatrist's testimony since he could not testify about the reliability of any specific witness. The supreme court opined that a jury is fully capable of assessing a witness's ability to perceive and remember, given the assistance of cross-examination and cautionary instructions, without the aid of expert testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed appellant's first-degree murder conviction and death sentence. The supreme court concluded that the trial court's evidentiary rulings on the photo line-up identification and the psychiatrist's opinion were correct. The supreme court also concluded that appellant presented no other reversible error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the Circuit Court in and for Duval County (Florida), denying his motion to vacate his conviction for first-degree murder and death sentence. Defendant brought a motion for habeas corpus, alleging that plaintiff state used false testimony and withheld material exculpatory evidence. Defendant appealed the court's order compelling the disclosure of defense documents related to postconviction litigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state was not entitled to compel production of attorney records used in defendant's postconviction litigation because the materials were defendant's private records. Despite, this error, defendant's first-degree murder conviction and death sentence were upheld because defendant's claims were procedurally barred and his attorney did not render ineffective assistance. Defendant was convicted of murdering a cab driver. Defendant brought a motion for postconviction relief, claiming that plaintiff deliberately used false and misleading testimony and withheld material exculpatory evidence. The trial court denied all relief. Defendant appealed and additionally brought a petition for habeas corpus. The reviewing court affirmed and denied the petition, holding that because defendant's claims were procedurally barred, no reversal was warranted. Defendant was not denied effective assistance because his appellate attorney failed to present unpreserved and meritless claims. Because postconviction defense records were private, an order compelling their production was improper. However, this error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt.</SPAN></P>

Defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel was because his appellate counsel was not required to raise meritless and unpreserved claims. Although defendant's postconviction litigation records were private and were improperly compelled, this was harmless error in light of the evidence of his guilt.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's counsel failed to make a contemporaneous objection to the trial court judge's alleged &quot;Golden Rule&quot; remark, thus, the issue was not preserved for appeal. Appellant's knowing and voluntary absence during critical proceedings did not warrant reversal. Crime scene photographs were properly admitted because they were not so shocking as to outweigh their relevancy. Voluntary and knowing statements appellant made to police after his arrest were properly admitted during the penalty phase. Jury instructions during the penalty phase were proper. The death penalty was properly imposed after the jury found aggravating, but not mitigating, factors. The departure from the guidelines was proper in sentencing appellant on the remaining charges after the jury found the victim suffered emotional trauma and that appellant had an escalating pattern of criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>

The violations allegedly occurred through the showing, sale, distribution, and rental of allegedly obscene writings and tapes, and objects allegedly intended for obscene purposes. The trial court dismissed the information and declared ch. 847.011 unconstitutional. The trial court held that, among other things, the statute violated Florida's privacy amendment, Fla. Const. art.

The appellate court held that ch. 914.22(a)(a) and 914.22(3) were unconstitutional for overbreadth and improper burden shifting. The appellate court found that a portion of the statute impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to defendant. The supreme court accepted review of the decision and affirmed the appellate court decision. The court found that the statute violated the due process clauses of Fla. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court overrode the jury's recommendation of life imprisonment and sentenced defendant to death, finding no mitigating factors and three aggravating factors.

The trial court did not consider whether the facts alleged in mitigation were supported by the evidence and did not determine whether the established facts were of a kind capable of mitigating defendant's punishment. The sentencer did not determine whether any such facts in the record were of sufficient weight to counterbalance the aggravating factors. The trial court also erred in confining its written order solely to the statutory mitigating factor of &quot;extreme&quot; emotional disturbance. Other nonstatutory mitigating factors were present and should have been considered. The death penalty was quashed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought a writ of prohibition to restrain respondent, a circuit court judge, from exercising jurisdiction over the cases at issue. The underlying actions were suits in inverse condemnation in which plaintiffs sought compensation under Fla. Stat. Ch. 89-91 (the Act) for citrus plants destroyed pursuant to the Canker Program. Respondent had denied petitioner's motion to dismiss, in which it was argued that the Act deprived respondent of jurisdiction over plaintiffs' cases because it effectively managed plaintiffs' claims. The court granted the instant petition, concluding that respondent did not have jurisdiction because the Act was constitutional. The court explained that the Act did not deny plaintiffs their right to a jury trial because the right to have a jury determine just compensation was statutory and not constitutionally required. The court further ruled that the determination of what constituted just compensation was constitutionally performed by the Act and was not necessarily a judicial function. Finally, the court concluded that the retroactive application of the Act to plaintiffs' cases was permissible because the Act did not take away any vested rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court was appellant's appeal and appellee's cross-appeal of a judgment of the Trial Court, in and for Polk County (Florida), that held that appellant's destruction of appellee's nursery stock that exhibited symptoms of a disease and those within 125 feet of the affected trees did not constitute a taking, but that appellee was entitled to compensation for the destruction of any healthy trees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a state agency, ordered the destruction of appellee's nursery stock after discovering a bacterial disease. Appellee subsequently filed suit against appellant alleging that the destruction of the stock constituted a taking for which he was entitled to compensation. The trial court, viewing the action as an inverse condemnation, determined that the destruction of the trees actually exhibiting symptoms of the disease and those within 125 feet of the affected trees did not constitute a taking, but that appellee was entitled to compensation for destruction of the healthy trees. The court affirmed, but remanded for a reconsideration of damages. The court, after agreeing that the trial court properly treated this as an inverse condemnation proceeding, explained that although it was a valid exercise of appellant's police power to destroy the trees, this still resulted in a taking for which compensation was due. However, the court reversed the judgment awarding damages, concluding that the trial court erroneously ruled that appellant could not introduce evidence of the public's fear of infected nursery stock and its effect on the fair market value of the property taken.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that the destruction of the trees actually exhibiting symptoms of the disease and those within 125 feet of the affected trees did not constitute a taking, but that appellee was entitled to full and just compensation for destruction of the healthy trees. However, the court reversed the judgment awarding damages, concluding that the trial court erroneously excluded evidence in its fair market value determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted in the Putnam County Circuit Court (Florida) of two counts of first-degree murder, armed robbery, burglary of a conveyance while armed and/or with assault, shooting or throwing a missile into an occupied vehicle, and sexual battery. He was given two death sentences and prison terms for the noncapital felonies, and he appealed all the convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant fired three shots from a high powered rifle into a pick-up truck, killing its two occupants. He and a co-defendant removed the victims from the vehicle, and appellant sexually abused the female corpse. Appellant and his co-defendant were convicted of two counts of first-degree murder, armed robbery, burglary of a conveyance while armed and/or with assault, shooting or throwing a missile into an occupied vehicle, and sexual battery. The jury recommended the death penalty. The trial court found two aggravators and no mitigating factors and sentenced appellant to death. Appellant challenged the convictions and sentences, arguing that his statement to police should have been suppressed because he was denied counsel, that he could not be convicted of sexual battery, and that the murder was not heinous, atrocious or cruel. The court affirmed the murder convictions but vacated the death sentences and reversed the sexual battery conviction because they were predicated on the assault on the female corpse, and events after death were irrelevant and could not be considered as aggravating factors. The court further found that improper testimony was considered in sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the first-degree murder convictions but vacated the death sentences because of improper jury instructions on the aggravators and improper usage of family members' inflammatory and prejudicial testimony during the penalty phase. The court reversed the sexual battery conviction because the victim was not alive at the time of the assault.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner challenged a ruling of the Second District Court of Appeals (Florida) that held while a jury instruction on the evidence of blood-alcohol content violated his constitutional due process rights by applying a mandatory presumption as to the element of intoxication, it was harmless error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner drove his semi-tractor into two cars, killing one person. Petitioner was charged with vehicular manslaughter, driving while intoxicated (DWI) manslaughter, and manslaughter. Police testimony at trial indicated that petitioner's blood-alcohol level (BAL) was .20 percent, that he smelled of alcohol, and that he poorly performed the field sobriety tests. Petitioner testified that he had one beer that night but had taken a cold medicine. Rebuttal testimony indicated that petitioner would have had to have consumed sixteen ounces of the cold remedy to achieve a BAL of .20 percent. A jury convicted petitioner of DWI manslaughter. Petitioner appealed arguing that the jury instruction given on the evidence of blood-alcohol content unconstitutionally created a mandatory presumption of intoxication. The appellate court agreed, but held that the error was harmless. On appeal, the court quashed the conviction because the jury instruction contained the language that evidence of a blood alcohol in excess of .10 percent was prima facie evidence of impairment, but did not define &quot;prima facie&quot; and that it was reasonably possible that the failure to define that term affected the verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed petitioner's conviction and ordered a new trial because the trial court did not define a legal term of art in its jury instructions. An ordinary layperson acting as a juror would have had to guess as to the meaning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant-petitioner death-row inmate sought reversal of trial court's order denying him post-conviction relief and simultaneously petitioned the state supreme court for habeas relief. The state supreme court denied all relief. It held that virtually all of appellant-petitioner's post-conviction claims were procedurally barred and that recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions with respect to jury selection were not retroactively applicable and therefore afforded no basis for granting collateral relief. Finally, the court rejected appellant-petitioner's assertion that the legislature's decision to shorten the time allotted for seeking post-conviction relief denied his rights, noting that such a claim had already been decided in another litigant's appeal. The court further rejected appellant-petitioner's claims of trial counsel ineffectiveness because he had made merely conclusory allegations; that favorable evidence had been suppressed, noting that the evidence was available to both sides; and of appellate counsel ineffectiveness, noting that appellate counsel need not raise unpreserved nonfundamental error claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying post-conviction relief was affirmed because most of the claims were procedurally defaulted and those that were not lacked merit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of burglary and other charges. His sentencing occurred before the sentencing guidelines became effective. The trial court sentenced him to consecutive sentences that totalled 260 years and retained jurisdiction for half of the sentence. The intermediate appellate court remanded the case for resentencing because the trial court incorrectly retained jurisdiction for one-half, instead of one-third, of the sentence. Defendant elected to be resentenced under the guidelines. The trial court departed from the guidelines and imposed two concurrent terms of life imprisonment on the burglary counts. The intermediate appellate court affirmed the departure from the guidelines but reversed the life sentences as being more severe than the definite term of years previously imposed. In answer to a certified question, the court determined that the life sentences were harsher because they carried no possibility of early release. The court further determined that a presumption of vindictiveness for the successful appeal was applicable. The court concluded that the trial court's departure from the guidelines based on age-related vulnerability was not valid.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner filed a motion for emergency relief and challenged the judgment. The supreme court concluded that the prohibition in art. III, &sect; 11(a)(1) was inapplicable to chartered counties, and that the provisions of ch. 71-393 had been validly applied to the county since it became a chartered county. The court reasoned that the legislature enacted ch. 71-393 subject to a referendum. The citizens of the county approved the act, and they elected school board members under the act for almost 18 years. Under the special circumstances in the case, the court found it reasonable to uphold the statute because it was not challenged prior to the county's becoming a chartered county and because its provisions were presently constitutional under art.

Ann. &sect; 370.08(3). Petitioner moved to dismiss the charges on grounds that the statute had been preempted by federal law and was unconstitutional. The trial court granted the motion. The appellate court reversed, finding the statute valid. The court approved the appellate court decision. Regulations issued under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, affecting the red drum fishery, did not preempt Florida law. Those regulations specifically provided that they would not be construed to supersede any state law that prohibited the landing or possession of red drum within that state. The statute did not violate due process or equal protection. It was sufficiently definite. In addition, Florida could regulate the conduct of its own citizens, although similar regulations did not exist in other states. The statute did not violate the commerce clause.

The court held that the social worker was competent to testify, based on her training and experience and her work with the child for over a year. It also found that she had stated that testifying in open court would be harmful to the child. However, the court reversed the decision because the trial court had failed to make specific findings of fact that the open court testimony would be harmful, in violation of Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury found appellant guilty of first-degree murder, aiding in an attempted escape, and related crimes. A sentence of death was imposed for the first-degree murder conviction. Appellant challenged his conviction alleging, inter alia, the trial court erred in not severing the multiple offenses in this case, and insufficiency of the evidence. The court held that with reference to the first claim regarding severance, all of the crimes arose out of a single criminal episode, which began with the unsuccessful attempt to free a prisoner and concluded in a police chase. Thus the trial court's denial of appellant's motion to sever was consistent with Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.150(a) and 3.152(a). With regard to sufficiency, the court agreed that the evidence was insufficient to establish first-degree premeditated murder. However, it was clearly sufficient to convict him of first-degree felony murder. Since there was no question that appellant played the major role in this felony murder and that he knew lethal force could be used, the court found that the death sentence was proportional. The court affirmed each of appellant's convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate petitioned the court for writ of habeas corpus. The court treated the petition as a writ of mandamus. Prior to 1983, state law gave the Florida Department of Corrections wide discretion in granting incentive gain-time to prisoners. The total possible award could be as great as forty-six days per month. In 1983, the gain time statute was revised and two earlier statutes governing incentive gain-time were repealed. Petitioner alleged that the 1983 amendments to Florida's gain-time statutes were being applied retroactively to deprive him of an earlier release from prison, in violation of ex post facto clauses of the Constitution. The new incentive statute was revised to decrease the largest possible award from thirty-seven to twenty days. Respondent State of Florida argued that the reduction did not render the law ex post facto, since the availability of incentive gain-time was nothing but a mere expectancy. The court granted the writ of mandamus. The 1983 amendment rendered the statute ex post facto because it actually disadvantaged petitioner within the meaning of the relevant case law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On direct appeal from the trial court, in and for Leon County (Florida), appellant department of revenue and appellee publishers argued that it was error to conclude that the appropriate standard to judge differential treatment of publications was strict scrutiny, rather than a rational basis test, and that differential taxation of magazines was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant department of revenue sought review of a trial court decision holding that differential taxation of magazines was unconstitutional. The court held that the state's statutory differentiation between secular magazines and newspapers for purposes of sales taxation burdened rights protected by U.S. Const. amend. I. The state sales tax could not be characterized as a nondiscriminatory tax on the receipts of magazines because it is not evenly applied. Rather, the scheme treated some periodicals less favorably than other periodicals. Because the differential taxation of magazines under the sales tax scheme burdened rights protected by the first amendment, the trial court correctly applied the strict scrutiny standard in determining whether such differential taxation was permissible. As between the imposition of the tax or the granting of an exemption, the court held that by statute, the tax prevailed. Having concluded that the appropriate remedy was to strike the exemption granted to newspapers, the court reversed that portion of the lower court's order which concluded that the appropriate remedy was to strike the tax imposed on magazines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court considered whether respondent lineal descendant, whose legacy was expressly limited by the decedent's will, had standing to set aside a charitable devise in that will. The court held that respondent had standing to petition to avoid the devise. However, the court quashed the decision of the lower court, holding that Fla. Stat. ch. 732.803, which would have allowed respondent to set aside the charitable devise, violated the equal protection guarantees of both the state and federal constitution because the classification established in that statute did not draw a rational distinction and was neither just nor reasonably related to a legitimate governmental purpose. Therefore, the court approved the decision of the court below as to standing, but quashed the decision as to its discussion of the constitutionality of the statute. The court declared that the statute was unconstitutional and remanded for further proceedings in accordance with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner sought review of the decision that denied his Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion and sought habeas corpus relief.

Other evidence, in addition to the statutory mitigating factors, was considered, and nothing was found that justified a life sentence. Eight issues raised by petitioner were procedurally barred because they sought to use habeas corpus to relitigate issues determined in a prior appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two appellees were noncustodial parents at the time that they became delinquent in their child support obligation. Complying with Fla. Stat. &sect; 61.14(5), the court clerk wanted to automatically enter a judgment for delinquent support money. Appellees had asserted that &sect; 61.14(5) was unconstitutional because it allowed for entry of judgment for delinquent child support once notice was given to appellees. The trial court agreed that &sect; 61.14(5) was unconstitutional and ruled in favor of appellees. State challenged the judgments, and the supreme court quashed the lower court decisions. The court explained that the manner in which the trial courts interpreted the statute was unconstitutional. However, the statute may be reasonably interpreted in a manner which provided obligors access to the courts to present common law and equitable defenses, effectively providing an opportunity to be heard and eliminating the lower courts' bases for holding the statute unconstitutional. Obligors should be allowed a hearing prior to entry of a final judgment provided that a timely response was filed. In addition, obligors must also have the opportunity to present equitable defenses at that hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court quashed the lower court decisions finding unconstitutional a Florida statute requiring an entry of final judgment 30 days after child support was delinquent. The statute was not unconstitutional, but the trial court had interpreted the statute improperly and failed to allow for due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of the judgment from the Trial Court in and for Leon County (Florida) that declared the Campaign Financing Act, Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 106.08(8) (1989), to be unconstitutional by impermissibly chilling appellee political candidate's rights of free speech and association under U.S. Const. amend. I and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 4 and 5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a political candidate for state office, filed a declaratory judgment action against the state, alleging that the Campaign Financing Act (Act), Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 106.08(8)(1989) violated his rights of free speech and association under the U.S. and Florida constitutions. The trial court declared that the Act was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that although the state had a compelling state interest in preventing corruption, because the Act prohibited all candidates from accepting or soliciting campaign contributions, even from themselves, during a regular or special session of the legislature, and because there was no statutory limit to the length of a legislative session, the Act was too broad to carry out the state's interest. In addition, the Act affected non-incumbents more than incumbents, restricted the right of candidates to amass the resources needed for effective advocacy of their political position, and severely restricted political speech and association. Therefore, the court found that the Act violated U.S. Const. amend. I, and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 4 and 5 and affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment finding that the Campaign Financing Act was unconstitutional, because it prohibited the receipt or solicitation of campaign funds during the potentially unlimited time that the legislature was in session, thus it was an impermissibly broad restriction on the rights of free speech and association guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The murder involved the bludgeoning death of appellant's wife. During the penalty phase of the trial, the court determined that there were two aggravating factors, including the heinous nature of the crime and premeditated manner in which it was executed, and there was one mitigating circumstance based upon appellant's minimal criminal history.

The court affirmed appellant's conviction for murder, but reversed and remanded the death sentence for imposition of a life sentence because the death sentence was disproportionate to the facts of the case. The court held that the death penalty was not proportionally warranted for a conviction of murder as a result of a heated domestic confrontation, except in some situations where the defendant had been convicted of a prior similar violent offense, which was not the case in appellant's situation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus and challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court in and for Orange County (Florida), following his conviction for murder and his sentence to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was a state prisoner under sentence of death for murder. He appealed the trial court's denial of his motion for postconviction relief, filed a request for habeas corpus relief, and requested a stay of execution. Petitioner also sought access to his criminal investigative file, which was kept by the state. The court affirmed the order denying petitioner postconviction relief and ordered the state to disclose to petitioner those portions of the state's file covered by the public records law, Fla. Stat. ch. 119. The state had denied petitioner access to its files under Fla. Stat. ch. 119.07(3)(d), which exempted the disclosure of active criminal investigations, and Fla. Stat. ch. 119.07(3)(o), which exempted certain portions of attorney work product. The court held that criminal investigative information with respect to a defendant was no longer active when his or her conviction became final and that the exemption under ch. 119.07(3)(d) expired when the conviction and sentence became final. Petitioner's claims regarding ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and on appeal were without merit. The petition for habeas corpus was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order denying petitioner's motion for postconviction relief because his claims regarding ineffective assistance of counsel were meritless.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner owned vacant land located adjacent to a highway. Petitioner had contracted to sell the property, contingent upon the buyer's ability to obtain the permits necessary to develop it.

Respondent recorded a map of reservation in accordance with Fla. Stat. ch. 337.241(1) (1987). The recordation of the map of reservation precluded the issuance of development permits for the property under Fla. Stat. ch. 337.241(2). Respondent contended that the legislature did not &quot;take&quot; but merely &quot;regulated&quot; in a valid exercise of the police power. The district court concluded that the challenged subsections were constitutional because petitioner had a remedy by way of an action for inverse condemnation. The court reversed and held Fla. Stat. ch. 337.241(2) and (3) invalid as violative of U.S. Const. amend. V and Fla. Const. art. X, &sect; 6(a).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent planning council sought a judgment against petitioner applicant for failing to pay the full amount of the cost to review his proposed substantial deviation from a development of regional impact (DRI), as required under Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 29L-2.02. The decision that declared Rule 29L-2.02 an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power was reversed, and petitioner sought review. A question was certified to determine whether the power to set and collect fees for DRI application and review costs was properly delegated to respondent by the state legislature. In approving the decision, the court held that Fla. Stat. chs. 160 and 163 gave respondent authority to levy fees where appropriate. The court noted that the legislature set forth, in considerable detail, specific criteria to be used by respondent in conducting DRI reviews. Given the highly technical nature of the DRI review process, the court found that details relating to the imposition of a cost-based review fee could be viewed as a technical matter of implementation rather than a fundamental policy decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. Defendant's counsel was appointed to represent him in executive clemency proceedings. Defendant's counsel filed a motion for compensation for his services in excess of the $ 1,000 maximum authorized under Fla. Stat. &sect; 925.035(4) (1987). Defendant's counsel's motion was granted, but reversed on appeal. Defendant's counsel thus sought further review. The court held that the trial court had the authority to exceed the statutory fee cap to compensate defendant's counsel for his representation of defendant in executive clemency proceedings because additional compensation was necessary to ensure effective representation. After hearing arguments from the prosecution and defendant's counsel, the trial court properly determined that the excess fees requested by defendant's counsel were reasonable. The court therefore quashed the appellate decision and remanded the case with instructions that the trial court's order awarding reasonable attorney fees and costs to defendant's counsel be reinstated.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that his department of corrections file contained exculpatory information previously unknown to defendant and that the state intentionally withheld the information. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. Defendant's claim that the state withheld exculpatory evidence had previously been raised in a Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion that was denied. The court held that defendant had an opportunity to avail himself of the public records act and to file for relief. His failure to obtain the information by means of the public records act did not amount to discovery violations. Moreover, after the deadline had passed, defendant raised the precise claim that was before the court and, once again, did not avail himself of the public records act. Therefore, defendant's claim was doubly barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Volusia County Circuit Court (Florida) convicting him of first degree murder and sentencing him to death, arguing that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a continuance and in denying the motion to withdraw by defendant's counsel. Defendant also argued that his sentence was improper because it failed to comply with Fla. Stat. &sect; 921.141(3) (1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of first degree murder and his death sentence. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a continuance to investigate a jailhouse confession that defendant made to another inmate. The testifying inmate was effectively cross-examined by defendant's counsel and any error in denying the continuance was harmless because defendant could not show that he was prejudiced by the denial. The trial court did not err in denying the motion to withdraw by defendant's counsel because defendant's counsel did not have a conflict of interest; the testifying inmate was not represented by another attorney in the office of defendant's counsel at the time he testified at defendant's trial. The court affirmed defendant's conviction because it was supported by substantial evidence. The court reduced defendant's sentence to life imprisonment without possibility of parole under Fla. Stat. &sect; 775.082 because the trial court did not make written findings specifically showing its independent weighing of mitigating and aggravating factors as required by Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of conviction was affirmed because it was supported by substantial evidence, the motion to withdraw was properly denied because there was no conflict of interest, and defendant's motion for a continuance was properly denied. The order sentencing defendant to death was reduced to life imprisonment because the trial court failed to make statutorily required specific, written findings regarding aggravating and mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected a majority of appellant's claims, stating that the claims were procedurally barred because they were raised or should have been raised on direct appeal. Appellant also asserted that she was denied effective assistance of counsel. The court was not persuaded by arguments that counsel's deficient performance in failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence was prejudicial to appellant. Mitigating evidence could not outweigh aggravating circumstances. The court also rejected appellant's claim that counsel was ineffective for creating a conflict of interest between himself and appellant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1934(2)(c) (Supp. 1986), regarding blood-alcohol level, was unconstitutional, but applying the harmless error test, the district court affirmed petitioner's driving under the influence of alcohol manslaughter conviction. Petitioner sought review, and the district court certified the question of the statute's constitutionality to the court. Because the court had recently held Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1934(2)(c) constitutional, the certified question was answered in the negative. Therefore, the court approved the result reached by the district court, but quashed that portion of its opinion holding the statute unconstitutional. Petitioner also challenged his sentence, which imposed a 15-year term of incarceration and, finding that petitioner's conviction violated his probation for a prior sexual battery conviction, also resentenced petitioner to 10 years imprisonment with credit for the five years he had already served. The court found no error in the sentencing.</SPAN></P>

The trial court further held that the trial court did not err in refusing to allow the defense to comment on an uncalled witness during closing argument. The rereading of testimony was within the discretion of the trial judge, and therefore there was no error. The trial judge did not err in admitting photographs because they were relevant to identifying the victim and illustrating the victim's wounds. The trial court did not err in refusing to declare a mistrial due to the admission of cumulative, irrelevant, and prejudicial evidence or alleged attempts by the prosecutor to shift the burden of proof. The aggravating factors were properly found. The facts supported a finding that the murder was cold, calculated, and premeditated. The decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent's daughter lay in a vegetative state for eight months until respondent shot her twice in the chest because he did not wish for her to suffer any longer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was convicted for felony driving under the influence pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 316.193(2)(b) (1985), which prescribed felony sanctions upon a fourth or subsequent violation of the drunk driving law, under Fla. Stat. ch. 316.193(1) (1985). The district court reversed the conviction on the grounds that the statute and corresponding jury instruction, which shifted the burden of proof to appellee on an element, violated the due process clause of the United States Constitution. The court disagreed with that analysis and reversed the case. The court concluded that a reasonable juror would have understood the challenged instruction, stemming from Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1934(2) (1985), as allowing proof of a blood-alcohol level of 0.10 percent or higher to be evidence of impairment, not as requiring a finding of impairment in that circumstance.

Fla. Stat. ch. 83-131 and U. S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court treated the petition as a writ of mandamus. Under the amendments, the incentive gain-time statute was revised to decrease the largest possible award from thirty-seven to twenty days.

Respondent State of Florida contended that the Department of Corrections always had the discretion to deny the incentive gain-time and that petitioner was not entitled to habeas relief based on the record.

On appeal, the court affirmed the district court of appeal and upheld &sect; 893.13(1)(e). The broad scope of Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a death row inmate, challenged the trial court's denial of his postconviction relief motion under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850. Petitioner also sought a stay of execution and a writ of habeas corpus. The state's highest court held that defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to adequately investigate defendant's background and family history and failing to obtain an independent expert on blood testing, even though counsel appended an affidavit to defendant's petition declaring that he believed himself to have been incompetent. Defendant introduced no objective evidence indicating that an earlier head injury affected his behavior; therefore, counsel's alleged failure to further investigate the injury in mitigation did not prejudice defendant. Other claims raised by defendant were procedurally barred. The court affirmed the denial of postconviction relief. The court also denied a writ of habeas corpus on identical grounds as those raised in the postconviction relief petition. The court vacated its temporary stay of execution pending appeal and reinstated the execution date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners brought product liability claims against respondents. The claims were dismissed as time barred because they were filed after the expiration of the twelve-year statute of repose prescribed in Fla. Stat.

In quashing the decision, the court held that it was improper to grant summary judgment in favor of respondents. The underlying principle in Strickland was applicable because, pursuant to Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21, petitioners had a viable cause of action and were entitled to rely on the existing law that provided them access to the court. Petitioners' claims accrued prior to the expiration of the statute of repose. While they still had time to file a claim within the statutory period, a relevant action was decided. Petitioners were at that time no longer bound to adhere to a twelve-year statute of repose. Petitioners had no reason to know that a later action would &quot;resurrect&quot; the statute of repose, effectively cutting off their viable claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, mobile home tenants, appealed the decision from the Fourth District Court of Appeal, Martin County (Florida) that affirmed the trial court's order granting summary judgment to respondent, a mobile home park owner, allowing it to evict petitioners pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 723.061(1)(d) (1985) because the park would be changed to vacant land. The question of whether a change to vacant land was a change in use was certified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, a mobile home park owner, filed an eviction action against petitioners, tenants in the park, seeking to vacate the park, thus changing its use. The trial court granted respondent's motion for summary judgment, and the appellate court affirmed the order, but certified the question of whether changing a mobile home park to vacant land or to no use was a change in use under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 723.061(1)(d) (1985. The court held that under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, respondent had a right to use its property for any lawful purpose, but petitioners had competing property rights as homeowners, and they were not merely tenants. Thus, the court held that a change to vacant land was a change in use under the statute provided petitioner acted in good faith, as required by &sect; 723.021 (1985), and did not use &sect; 723.061(1)(d) (1985) to evade &sect; 723.071, which required respondent to offer the land for sale to its tenants' association before selling the land to another party. Thus, because respondent's good faith had not been determined, the court quashed the decision and remanded the case to vacate the order of summary judgment and to conduct further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the decision affirming the order granting summary judgment to respondent, a mobile home park owner because, although changing the park to vacant land was a change in use that gave respondent the right to evict petitioners, mobile home tenants, the trial court had yet to determine that respondent was acting in good faith and not trying to deprive its tenants of their statutory right to have the first option to buy the park.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, members of the state legislature, passed an appropriations act under 1989 Fla. Laws ch. 89-253. Respondent governor vetoed seven portions of the act. A petition requesting a writ of mandamus to expunge the vetoes from the records was granted in part and denied in part. The veto power did not embrace authority to nullify a qualification or restriction unless the governor simultaneously nullified the related fund of money. The governor conceded that three of the vetoes were unconstitutional. The governor was not authorized to assign value to a proviso if the legislature itself had not done so. The second veto involved proviso language creating an appropriation which was divided into two separate units. The governor's veto acceptably sought to eliminate one but not the other. In each of the remaining vetoes, the governor did not veto the entire sum of money appropriated for a single stated purpose. Permitting the vetoing of individual funding sources came too close to authorizing the governor to reduce appropriations. However, veto number seven was directed at two distinct elements of the act and the two were not so closely related as to be inseparable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted in part and denied in part the request for a writ of mandamus because the governor unconstitutionally vetoed provisions when the governor assigned values to provisos or did not veto entire sums of money. The governor properly exercised his power where provisions were separate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court entered a written order adjudicating appellant a habitual violent felony offender and a prison releasee reoffender based upon the same convictions. The trial court sentenced appellant as a prison releasee reoffender, to a term of 15-years imprisonment and as a habitual violent felony offender to 10-years in prison followed by 10-years on probation. Appellant contended that being sentenced both as a habitual violent felony offender and as a prison releasee reoffender violated the prohibitions against double jeopardy provided in the U.S. Const. amend. V and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The court agreed with appellant that he had received two separate sentences for the same crime, with different lengths and release eligibility requirements.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for battery on a law enforcement officer. On appeal, defendant claimed multiple errors, including his assertion that the prosecutor improperly commented on the defendant's silence. The court held that the prosecutor's comment related to defendant's defense, not his silence, and in fact, defendant testified at trial. The court found no error in excluded statements due to the lack of a sufficient proffer, and there were other witnesses who testified at trial, including the appellant himself, who testified about the victim's allegedly aggressive statements toward appellant. The proffered statements would have been cumulative to testimony already admitted, and failure to admit the proffered statement was, at most, harmless error. When asked whether he put up his fists to fight the defendant, the victim made an unsolicited statement that he &quot;was not that type of person.&quot; The court found this statement harmless, even if classified as traditional character evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082(8) was unconstitutionally vague because the legislature failed to define the terms &quot;sufficient evidence,&quot; &quot;material witness,&quot; the degree of materiality required, &quot;extenuating circumstances,&quot; and &quot;just prosecution.&quot; Appellant failed to identify how the plain language of the statute rendered it impossible for a person of ordinary intelligence to read the statute and understand how the legislature intended the terms to apply to any particular defendant. The court concluded that appellant did not satisfy his burden of demonstrating that the statutory language was unconstitutionally vague. Appellant lacked standing to present a double-jeopardy argument because he was not also sentenced as a habitual felony offender. The court found that felony petit theft was not one of the statutorily enumerated offenses for which a prison releasee reoffender sentence could be lawfully imposed. Therefore, the sentence was illegal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence was vacated in part. Appellant's sentence for felony petit theft was vacated because the sentence both failed to comport with statutory limitations and was illegal because it was not an offense for which a prison releasee reoffender sentence could be imposed. Appellant's sentence for resisting arrest with violence was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was sentenced following the entry of a no contest plea of luring or enticing a child, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 787.025. Appellant filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the statute's use of the phrase &quot;lawful purpose&quot; was unconstitutionally vague. The term &quot;lawful purpose&quot; was not defined in ch. 787.025, ch. 794, or ch. 800.04. The affirmative defenses in the statute failed to give meaning to the phrase, because they set forth an unconstitutional mandatory rebuttable presumption by requiring appellant to prove he had a &quot;lawful purpose.&quot; Also, ch. 787.025(3)(b) provided that appellant's &quot;lawful purpose&quot; in luring or enticing the child was in itself an affirmative defense, therefore, any argument that the affirmative defenses added meaning was circuitous. There was also nothing in common usage that helped define the term, since it was possible to reach different conclusions regarding whether an act was lawful using dictionary definitions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order reversed; statute was unconstitutionally vague, since &quot;lawful purpose&quot; was not defined in the statute, the affirmative defenses portions could not be used to add meaning since they set forth an unconstitutional mandatory rebuttable presumption, and because different conclusions could be reached using dictionary definitions of the term.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed for relief from an illegal sentence under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a). The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court affirmed, writing to clarify whether the kind of sentencing error appellant alleged, failure to file written findings for a departure sentence, qualified as an illegal sentence within the meaning of the rule. From existing caselaw, the court discerned that the &quot;short list&quot; of illegal sentences had only three members: (1) those sentences in excess of the statutory maximum; (2) those sentences that fail to give credit for record jail time; and (3) those sentences that violate double jeopardy by a post sentencing enhancement clear from the record. If there was error in any other kind of sentence, and particularly if it involved any factual inquiry, such error could be corrected in direct review or possibly under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850, but not under rule 3.800(a).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of unlawful solicitation of motor vehicle tort or personal injury protection claims. The court concluded that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 817.234(8) (1995) was not unconstitutional. The statute was not a ban on all solicitation by a chiropractor, but rather targeted those persons who solicited business for the purpose of making motor vehicle tort or personal injury protection benefits claims. The court held that the statute was reasonably tailored to the state's interest in preventing insurance fraud and raised premiums. The statute created no impermissible burden on the right to commercial free speech. Likewise, the statute was neither void for vagueness, nor violative of the right to equal protection. There was a common definition to the term &quot;solicitation&quot; that left no doubt as to the nature of the activity prohibited. There was a rational basis for the classification -- the prevention of insurance fraud. Thus, there was no equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following his conviction for failure to register as a sex offender, appellant argued Fla. Stat. ch. 943.0435 (Supp. 1998) was facially unconstitutional because it failed to contain a scienter or guilty knowledge element. The court affirmed, holding that while the presence of a mens rea or guilty mind had long been a requirement of criminal responsibility, legislative bodies had the power to dispense with the element of intent and punish particular acts without regard to a malicious or wrongful mental attitude. The court concluded that the Florida Legislature weighed the possible injustice of subjecting an offender unaware of the statute to a penalty against the evil of exposing innocent citizens to danger from repeat sexual offenders, and concluded the latter was the result preferably to be avoided.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida) convicting him of sexual battery and sentencing him pursuant to the Prison Releasee Reoffender Act, Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of sexual battery. The trial court entered a sentence pursuant to the Prison Releasee Reoffender Act (the Act), Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082(8) (1997). Because each amended section dealt in some fashion with reoffenders, the court concluded that the statute dealt with a single subject. The Act did not violate the separation of powers clause. The court held that imposition of the maximum sentence provided by statutory law did not constitute cruel or unusual punishment, because there was no possibility that the Act inflicted torture or a lingering death or the infliction of unnecessary and wanton pain. The court held that appellant was prohibited from raising any argument that the Act was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the Act did not violate prohibitions against ex post facto laws. Because the minimum mandatory sentence ran concurrently to the habitual felony offender sentence, there was no violation of double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

The Prison Releasee Reoffender Act did not constitute cruel or unusual punishment because it did not inflict torture, a lingering death, or unnecessary and wanton pain.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with battery and appeared for arraignment. The trial judge failed to advise him concerning his right to counsel for representation at arraignment before she accepted a plea of guilty to the charge. The judge did advise appellant he had a right to counsel in the event he went to trial, and the judge accepted a form signed by appellant and his mother wherein it was asserted, under oath, that S.S. was entitled to the right to an attorney, and the right to have an attorney appointed if he could not afford one. The form itself was insufficient to overcome the arraignment deficiency and did not, in any event, abrogate the responsibility of the trial judge under Fla. R. Juv. P. 8.165. Counsel was eventually appointed for trial on the issue of whether appellant was a street gang member pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 874.04 (Supp. 1996). However, this statute had since been held unconstitutional. The trial judge's failure to adequately advise appellant concerning his right to appointment of counsel at the critical stage of arraignment constituted fundamental error.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of robbery without a firearm and was given an enhanced sentence. He claimed on appeal that the trial court erred in imposing an upward departure sentence pursuant to Fla. Stat.

Legislature clearly intended a recent release from a probationary term to be a consideration in determining whether to impose an enhanced sentence. Appellant's claim that &sect; 921.0016(3)(e) was ambiguous was also rejected. Legislature did not differentiate between adult probation and juvenile probation.

</DIV>

Petitioner contended that the fixed hourly rate of $ 40 an hour was confiscatory of an attorney's time, energy, and talents, and denied a criminal defendant his right to the effective assistance of counsel. The court denied the petition, finding there was competent, substantial evidence on which the trial court could find that the $ 40 hourly rate did not materially impair the ability of lawyers to fulfill their roles or that it curtailed the power of the court to appoint attorneys.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sale of cocaine after which he entered a direct appeal, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence. The conviction was affirmed without discussion, as the argument raised on appeal differed from the argument presented in the trial court. Defendant then claimed in a motion for postconviction relief that his trial counsel was ineffective by failing to preserve his sufficiency of the evidence argument. The trial court properly rejected this claim. Even if trial counsel had made a more elaborate sufficiency argument, the motion for judgment of acquittal would have been correctly denied. The testimony was sufficient to create a jury question on the charge of sale or delivery of cocaine. Claim that the habitual offender statute, 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 95-182, was unconstitutional because it violated Florida's single subject rule had been previously rejected. Conviction and sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of escape and sentenced as a habitual violent felony offender (HVFO). The HVFO adjudication was vacated because another decision held the 1989 amendments to the HVFO statute unconstitutional as violating Florida's single subject rule. On remand, the trial court in 1993, resentenced defendant as a habitual felony offender (HFO). Defendant contended that his sentence was illegal because imposition of the HFO sentence violated the double jeopardy clause, in that he had effectively been impliedly acquitted of any disposition under the habitual offender statute. On appeal, the court held that at resentencing, the trial court had the options of resentencing under the 1988 version of the HVFO statute, or under the HFO statute, or under the guidelines. As the HFO statute is more lenient than the HVFO statute, and as the sentence imposed on the defendant at resentencing was more lenient, there was no double jeopardy violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On a routine traffic stop, officers issued the driver a citation in lieu of arrest.

At the suppression hearing the officers admitted they had seen no evidence of criminal activity and had no probable cause to search other than the driver's driving without a license, but believed they had the right to search the vehicle as incident to issuing a criminal citation in lieu of making an arrest, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 901.28. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the search and seizure violated appellant's U.S. Const. amend.

The terms &quot;delinquent&quot; or &quot;dependent child&quot; or &quot;child in need of services&quot; were terms of art which were not common enough to be understood so as to provide a reasonable warning of the behavior prescribed by ch. 827.04. A penal statute had to define any terms that did not have an ordinary meaning or specify a source to find definitions so that ordinary persons were not left to guess at the statute's meaning or differ as to its application. Omission in the statute of any reference to &quot;the laws of Florida&quot; as the source for definition of the critical phrases was fatal to the constitutionality of the statute.

The court determined that appellant had adequate opportunity to be heard on the issue of the proper interpretation of &sect; 377.241.

The sentencing guidelines applied to defendant were later held unconstitutional, and the trial court denied defendant's motion to correct illegal sentence. On appeal, the court held that because the sentencing guidelines in effect when defendant committed his offense were invalid, the trial court had no authority to sentence defendant to a guidelines sentence and the court of appeal had no legal basis to disapprove of a downward departure sentence. Thus, defendant's original sentences were valid because the trial court at that time had discretion to impose any sentence within the statutory maximum, including the original 20-year prison terms first imposed upon defendant.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was released from Florida Department of Corrections on August 23, 1996. The Act became effective May 30, 1997. Defendant's conviction for burglary, grand theft, and battery on a law enforcement officer stemmed from acts committed on July 19, 1997, within three years of his release. Defendant asserted that the Act was unconstitutional on numerous grounds. The appeal court upheld the Act because it was not being applied retroactively; the trial court had retained some discretion in sentencing; it bore a relationship to a legislative objective and was not discriminatory, arbitrary, or oppressive; it was rationally related to legitimate state interests; and defendant had notice and an opportunity to be heard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee State, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 944.512, sought imposition of a lien against property in an action against appellant, convicted criminal, especially seeking proceeds from sale of a book containing accounts of the crimes for which appellant was convicted. Appellants argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 960.291(7) violated U.S. Const. amend. I and was, therefore, unconstitutional both on its face and as applied to each of them. Under the plain language of the statute the lien encompassed appellant's art, autographs, and proceeds from them, as well as proceeds from his book. Appellant publisher was receiving benefits on appellant offender's behalf and thus the lien attached to the proceeds she garnered from sale of property. Appellant offender could not transfer his property to appellant publisher to avoid the lien.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order affirmed; imposition of the lien upheld under the statute because upon petition, the court could enter a civil restitution lien against the real or personal property of a convicted offender, and appellant's art, book and proceeds were encompassed by the lien.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the petition. The appeal court held that there was no ex post facto violation because Fla. Stat. ch. 947.1745(6) (1977) was procedural and did not add to the punishment. However, the appeal court quashed the decision and remanded for a hearing on writ of mandamus because the parole commission failed to notify the sentencing judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with battery of a law enforcement officer and disorderly conduct.

A jury found defendant not guilty of battery of a law enforcement officer, but guilty of disorderly conduct. On appeal, the court held that words alone cannot support a disorderly conduct charge unless they are fighting words or false words reporting some physical hazard. The jury instruction given by the trial court allowed for the possibility that the jury convicted defendant of disorderly conduct based solely on her screaming and shouting and the disruption which it apparently caused.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Department of Insurance appealed the trial court's decision declaring Fla. Stat. ch. 627.782(8)&nbsp;unconstitutional. Appellee title company argued that the statute violated the right to equal protection of the law because it imposed a burden on non-lawyer title insurance agents that was not also imposed on lawyers who sold title insurance. The court found that the rational relationship test applied, because the statute did not impair a fundamental right or affect a suspect class of persons. The question was whether the legislators had reason to believe that the classification imposed by the operation of the statute would promote the legislative objective. The court found that the legislature had valid reasons to exclude lawyers from the reporting requirement. For example, the inclusion of lawyers would make the reporting requirement much more difficult to enforce and less accurate in terms of apportioning of expense data. The statute was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 775.082(8) (1997) for three counts of felony battery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant raised numerous constitutional challenges to the Prison Releasee Reoffender Punishment Act (the Act), Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 775.082(9) (1997). The court found that appellant's arguments that the Act violated various aspects of the Florida Constitution were without merit. The Act did not violate the separation of powers clause by infringing on the ability of prosecutors to engage in plea bargaining. There was no constitutional right to plea bargaining. Application of the Act was another factor about which to negotiate. Imposition of the maximum sentence provided by statutory law was not cruel or unusual because there was no possibility that the Act inflicted torture or a lingering death or the infliction of unnecessary and wanton pain. The Act did not pose a due process violation as the provision merely expressed the legislative intent that the prosecution give consideration to the preference of victims when considering application of the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appeal concerned a dispute over the 1997 ad valorem tax status of property owned by appellee aviation authority, leased to a sports authority, and licensed to a major league baseball team for use as a baseball facility. Appellant county appraiser assessed subject property at approximately $ 5,000,000 without granting any portion of it a governmental tax exemption. Appellee filed a petition with the Value Adjustment Board (VAB), pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 194.011(3) (1997), seeking to overturn appellee's assessment, and VAB reduced assessment to approximately $ 1,000,000, pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 196.012(6) (1997). Appellant challenged constitutionality of the exemption, but the trial court dismissed appellant's complaint because appellant did not include the Department of Revenue as party-defendant. The court affirmed on an alternative theory, holding that appellant, in his official capacity as the county property appraiser, did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the exemption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted procurement of a monor for prostitution and attempted indecent assault. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion to reduce the charge of procurement to solicitation. According to defendant, the facts presented at trial constituted solicitation rather than attempted procurement, because the procurement statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 796.03, proscribed the hiring of a minor for sexual activity with a third person, and defendant attempted to hire a minor for sexual activity with himself. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction for attempted indecent assault, but reversed his conviction for attempted procurement of a minor for prostitution. The court held that a strict construction of the procurement statute demonstrated that the statute was drafted to prohibit hiring a minor for sexual activity with a third person.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for attempted indecent assault, but reversed his conviction for attempted procurement of a minor for prostitution.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of a non-final order of the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida), which denied their motion to certify as a class to recover allegedly improper sales taxes charged by appellee phone company and remitted to appellee Florida Department of Revenue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellants applied for a tax refund on behalf of their proposed class, which appellee Florida Department of Revenue denied in full, appellants filed a motion to certify the class, which the trial court denied. Because two of the appellants had applied for and been denied a refund, they could continue to pursue their individual claim, while others similarly situated had to each make a refund application and be denied in order to be represented in any future class action suit. Appellants did not allege that the tax was unconstitutional, but instead that appellee telephone company was taxing in an improper manner and for an unlawful amount. Although requiring all of the potential members of the class to apply for a refund before joining a class action suit was wasteful of resources the court was required to follow the decision of the Florida Supreme Court. Since it appeared that only two of the appellants applied for a refund, they were the only parties that could go forward with their action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the trial court which, in part, denied the appellants' motion to certify as a class was affirmed because appellants were required to assert the sales tax was unconstitutional in order to sue without first applying for a refund.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiff sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Brevard County (Florida) awarding summary judgment to the defendants, a bank and a security company, in her action to recover funds that they withdrew from her account and sent to the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to a levy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiff was the beneficiary of a self-directed individual retirement account (IRA) with the defendants, a security company and a bank. The plaintiff filed suit against the defendants after they complied with a levy notice, filed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), by giving her notice of the levy, removing $ 123,870 from her IRA, and mailing a check to the IRS for that amount. The trial court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that although the plaintiff might have had remedies that she could assert against the IRS for an improper levy on her property, the grounds that she sought to pursue against the defendants were legally insufficient. The court further found that federal law permitted no remedy for the plaintiff against the defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order awarding summary judgment to the defendants, a security company and a bank, in the plaintiff's action to recover funds that they withdrew from her account and sent to the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to a levy was affirmed because federal law permitted no remedy for the plaintiff against the defendants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a person 24 years of age or older, sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida), which convicted him of having engaged in sexual activity with a person 16 or 17 years of age, in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 794.05(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with: having committed sexual battery upon a person 12 years of age or older in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 794.011(4) (count one); and being a person 24 years of age or older and having engaged in sexual activity with the same victim by placing his penis in or upon the victims' vagina, in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 794.05(1) (count two). Defendant was found guilty on count two. On appeal, the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to dismiss count two on constitutionality grounds was affirmed because &sect; 794.05 was found to neither unconstitutionally violate equal protection or the right to privacy. Even if the trial court had erred in denying a pretrial motion to sever the counts, defendant could not demonstrate prejudice because his admission as to count one that he had engaged in sexual activity with the victim would have been relevant and admissible at a subsequent trial on count two. However, defendant's sentence was vacated and remanded for resentencing because the victim injury points on the sentencing guidelines score sheet included points for sex penetration even though the verdict did not specify whether sexual penetration took place.</SPAN></P>

However, defendant's sentence was vacated and remanded for resentencing without sex penetration points on the victim injury sentencing score sheet.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for the offenses of armed robbery and aggravated battery with a firearm. Defendant appealed those convictions. The court found no reversible error and affirmed defendant's convictions. The court did however, address defendant's constitutional challenges to the Prison Releasee Reoffender Punishment Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082 (1997) (the statute), which defendant alleged violated the separation of powers clause and the single subject requirement of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6 of the Florida Constitution. The court upheld the validity statute against defendant's separation of powers challenge, but certified the question of whether the statute was in violation of the state's constitution's separation of powers clause to the state supreme court. The court also found that the statute did not violate the single subject requirement of the state's constitution because each section of Fla. Laws ch. 97-239 dealt with reoffenders and did not accomplish separate and disassociated objects of legislative efforts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his judgment, conviction, and sentence by the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit (Florida), on charges of robbery with a firearm, aggravated assault with a firearm, and attempted second degree murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following appellant's judgment, conviction, and sentence, on charges of robbery with a firearm, aggravated assault with a firearm, and attempted second degree murder, appellant sought review of his judgment. Appellant argued it was error to deny his request to backstrike a juror, and it was error to sentence him, as an ex post facto application of the law pursuant to Prison Release Reoffender Act (act), Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082(8)(a)1. The court held that although denial of appellant's right to challenge any juror, either peremptorily or for cause, prior to the time the jury was sworn, was per se reversible error, appellant did not preserve the issue for review. Appellant's counsel failed to enter an objection to the trial court's erroneous ruling. Instead, counsel's use of the word &quot;okay&quot; was in acquiescence to that ruling. The court held that the act, providing for greater penalties for offenses committed within three years of release from prison, violated the ex post facto clause because the act was being applied retrospectively. Appellant was released from prison prior to the act's inception, and also convicted from crimes prior to the act's effective date.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction but vacated his sentence and remanded. Although denial of appellant's right to challenge any juror before the jury was sworn constituted reversible error, appellant failed to preserve issue for review. Reoffender Act, providing greater penalties for offenses committed within three years of prison release, violated the ex post facto clause because the act was applied retrospectively to appellant.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed his conviction, holding that the statute was not vague, and did not violate the Establishment Clause because it had a secular legislative purpose, its principal or primary effect neither advanced nor inhibited religion, and it did not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion. The court said that, given the presumption in favor of the constitutionality of statutes, it would be inappropriate to impute the unconstitutional purpose of the advancement of religion, because a secular purpose of deterring drug sales near places where the public, especially families and young people, had a tendency to gather, was equally, if not more likely.</SPAN></P>

On appeal the court affirmed and held that appellants were not entitled to visitation. Privacy was a fundamental right and &sect; 752.01 infringed on that right. Therefore, the statute was subject to, and failed, the compelling state interest test because it required a court to order visitation based on the child's best interests without requiring proof of demonstrable harm to the child.

Appellants were strangers to appellants' son's child under the adoption statutes.&nbsp;Fla. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of seven counts of sexual battery on a child under 12 and three counts of lewd acts upon a child. During the trial, the trial court ordered the courtroom closed to persons not listed in Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 918.16(1997) during the testimony of the then 14-year-old victim. Appellant sought review and alleged that the trial court improperly closed the courtroom. The court affirmed and held that the partial closure of the trial was authorized under &sect; 918.16. The right of access in a criminal trial was not absolute. The trial court was not required to consider the four Waller factors in deciding whether to order a partial closure. The trial court's decision to order a partial closure pursuant to &sect; 918.16 without inquiring into whether there was a substantial or compelling reason to order closure was not erroneous. By enacting &sect; 918.16, the legislature found that there was a compelling state interest to protect young children when they testified regarding sexual offenses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was an association that represented a majority of thoroughbred racehorse owners and trainers. Appellees were thoroughbred racehorse owners who were not members of appellant. Appellees sought a declaration that Fla. Stat.

The circuit court entered summary judgment in favor of appellees. The appellate court affirmed the judgment. Appellees had standing to challenge, and were not estopped from challenging, the statute because the statute clearly applied to appellees and because appellees did not receive any benefit from the statute. The statute was unconstitutional because it did not require that the funds paid to appellant be spent in furtherance of a legitimate state objective or describe how the funds were to be spent. Further, the unconstitutional portions of the statute could not be excised from the statute because without the unconstitutional portions, the statute was meaningless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee personal representative filed a complaint against appellant nursing home for the death of a patient. The Circuit Court of Hillsboro County (Florida) included appellee, the Attorney General of Florida, on behalf of the Veteran's Affairs hospital (hospital), as a defendant. The jury apportioned the liability 39 percent to the nursing home and 61 percent to the hospital. The personal representative and the nursing home appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a patient died in the hospital, his personal representative filed an action against the nursing home from which the patient was transferred. The nursing home requested that the hospital be included as a defendant in the case and on the jury verdict form. The trial court granted the request. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment in favor of the personal representative as to the liability issue. The court held that the terms adequate and appropriate health care and the right to be treated courteously, fairly, and with the fullest measure of dignity under Fla. Stat. ch. 400.022 (1993) were terms of common usage and understanding. Thus, ch. 400.022 was not unconstitutionally vague. However, the court reversed the judgment apportioning damages between the hospital and the nursing home. The court held that the hospital should not have been included on the verdict form. The hospital was not a joint tort-feasor with the nursing home. It was a subsequent or successive independent tort-feasor. Therefore, the personal representative was entitled to recover the entirety of his damages from the nursing home as the initial tort-feasor, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 768.81 (1993).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the personal representative as to liability. The court reversed the judgment to the extent of the apportionment of damages and remanded the case to the trial court for the entry of judgment for the personal representative in the full amount of the jury verdict.</SPAN></P>

The officer felt a cloth bag inside the pocket containing plastic bags, inside which he could feel a leafy substance, and extracted it. Appellant's motion to suppress the evidence was denied and this appeal was taken. The court found that the deputy had no lawful justification, under the surrounding circumstances, to reach in, grab, and remove the bag from appellant's pocket, admittedly with no idea of what the item was until the contraband was extracted. Therefore, the exception to the warrant requirement did not apply and did not validate the search, and the conviction and sentence was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the decision for the plaintiffs noting that the new statute did not impair the rental agreement in any way and that it was the prerogative of the legislature to impose reasonable regulations on mobile home lot owners as it saw fit. The court also held that, because the plaintiffs were the prevailing parties in that they achieved some of what they sought in the suit, they were entitled to attorney's fees and costs.</SPAN></P>

He challenged the sentence on the basis that it violated the constitutional provision against ex post facto laws. The court held that the statute had been found constitutional. Defendant also argued that the statute had, in effect, removed sentencing discretion from the judicial branch where it constitutionally should reside. The court ruled that it was within the province of the legislature to determine the penalties for crimes, as long as the penalties were not cruel and unusual. The statute, which required the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence if certain conditions were met, did not violate the separation of powers clause by virtue of the fact that it removed sentencing discretion from the judiciary.</SPAN></P>

The reviewing court found that Fla. Stat. ch. 752.01(1)(d), which authorized grandparent visitation for children born out of wedlock, was unconstitutional. The reviewing court further dismissed appellants' claim that their circumstances were within the exception to the statute because there were proceedings under Fla. Stat. ch. 39. Chapter 39, however, only authorized grandparent visitation after a child had been adjudicated dependent, and terminated those visitation rights when a child had been returned to the physical custody of a parent or others. The granddaughter was never declared dependent, and accordingly the grandparents had no right to visitation simply because of the Chapter 39 proceeding. The order was affirmed. Appellants lacked standing to challenge the order for visitation rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate was convicted of attempted sexual battery on person less than 12 years of age . Appellant brought an action alleging that the restriction of visitation privileges for inmates with conviction for sexual battery was a unconstitutional infringement upon his due process rights, a bill of attainder, and an ex post facto law. The trial court granted final summary judgment and appellant sought review. The court found that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 944.09 (1)(n), as amended in 1996, was constitutional because it served important state interests of protecting minor children from convicted sex offenders. The court found &sect;944.09(1)(n) was narrowly tailored because it did not deny visitation completely but instead left the determination within the discretion of the superintendent, who must assess the interests of the children involved. The court determined an inmate had no absolute right to visitation and no unconstitutional violation of appellant's liberty interest had occurred. The challenge to the amended statutory provision as an improper ex post facto law was properly rejected because the statute neither increased appellant's punishment nor denied him a vested right.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the decision of the lower court dismissing the charge of driving without a license and causing death on grounds that the statute was unconstitutional where the court found that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. Where driving without a license was a criminal offense, the court found that the legislature was permitted to further criminalize those actions by unlicensed drivers which resulted in death to others.

The purpose of the statute was to prevent insurance fraud such that the state's interest in the regulation was substantial. The statute directly advanced the important state interest and was not more far-reaching than necessary. The statute did not prohibit chiropractors from soliciting business, but only banned persons from soliciting business for the purpose of making motor vehicle tort or insurance benefits claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida) was brought seeking to overturn the ruling by the court that Fla. Stat. ch. 39.809(4) (1998) was unconstitutional. The effect of declaring the statute unconstitutional would be to open up the termination of parental rights hearings to the public and media.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, state government, brought this action against the respondents to terminate their parental rights. The state alleged that these parents intentionally caused their 11-year old daughter to become ill enough to be repeatedly hospitalized. Under Fla. Stat. ch. 39.809(4) (1998), all hearings involving termination of parental rights (TPR) were confidential and closed to the public. The parents filed a motion to declare the statute invalid on the grounds that it violated the U.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV. The effect of declaring the closing statute unconstitutional would have been to open up the TPR hearings to the public and media. The trial court in reaching its decision on the constitutional question, accepted the proposition that TPR cases were to be treated like criminal prosecution, and concluded that open hearings in TPR cases would promote fairness and public confidence in the judicial system. On petition for certiorari the court reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings, holding the state had a compelling interest in closing the proceeding given the nature of the case and the harmful effect on the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certiorari and upheld the statute which the lower court had held unconstitutional, finding that the state had the power to close hearings terminating parental rights, and returned the case to the circuit court for further proceedings. Given the nature of the proceeding, the state had substantial and compelling governmental purposes to support closure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant psychological parent sought review of orders of the Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, Indian River County (Florida), which dismissed appellant's petition for custody and denied her motion for visitation of appellee parent's biological child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant psychological parent argued that she was a psychological parent to appellee parent's biological child and, consequently, she had parental status equivalent to appellee, which gave her standing to seek custody or visitation of appellee's child over appellee's objection. Although recognizing the concept of psychological parent, the court rejected appellant's assertion that her status was equal to appellee's, noting that appellant failed to meet the statutory custody or visitation requirements for non-parents. Appellee biological parent had a right to make decisions about her child's welfare without interference from appellant, the court ruled, cautioning that a state could not intervene and circumvent appellee's right to privacy absent a showing of demonstrable harm to the child. Consequently, appellee lacked standing to pursue custody or visitation of appellee's biological child and a state could not compel visitation between the child and one, like appellee, who was neither a parent, nor grandparent, nor one who stood in loco parentis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Orders affirmed dismissing appellant psychological parent's petition for custody and denying her motion for visitation of appellee parent's biological child, because appellant lacked standing to seek custody/visitation over appellee's objections, as status of psychological and biological parents not equivalent and state could not circumvent appellee's right of privacy, in absence of harm to the child.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 95-184. Defendant contended 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 95-184 was unconstitutional because it violated the single-subject rule of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6. Defendant alleged that 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 95-184 combined criminal penalties with civil remedies, because sections within the chapter were devoted to career criminal sentencing and civil remedies for domestic violence injunctions. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, because a common-sense relationship existed between the criminal penalties and civil remedies portions of the chapter. The sections all dealt with remedies for acts which constituted crimes, and the purpose of the statute was crime prevention. Even though the statute addressed civil remedies for domestic violence, the acts of domestic violence were crimes. The court certified the question whether 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 95-184 violated Fla.

Appellant argued on appeal that the statute was unconstitutional for vagueness, because the statute failed to define &quot;a place of worship,&quot; &quot;a church or religious organization,&quot; or &quot;regularly conducted religious services.&quot; On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that since appellant's conduct clearly fell within the statutory prohibition, he could not successfully challenge it for vagueness or complain of its vagueness as applied to the hypothetical conduct of others. The court found that an officer testified that the subject church was a &quot;regular&quot; church, which held nightly services as well as Sunday services. Appellant presented no evidence on the issue. The court concluded that because &sect; 893.13(1) was not impermissibly vague in all of its applications, it was facially constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant probationer appealed an order from the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), which, upon an affidavit filed by plaintiff state, revoked defendant's probation after she violated a special condition that she have no contact with children under 16 years of age unless supervised by an adult who was aware that defendant was on probation for child abuse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant probationer pled no contest to child abuse, adjudication withheld, in exchange for probation with special conditions. She violated the conditions, was adjudicated guilty of child abuse, and a new condition was imposed on defendant's probation which required her to have no contact with children under 16 years of age unless supervised by an adult who was aware that defendant was on probation for child abuse. Defendant violated this condition. Holding that a probationer could not challenge a probation condition on appeal from an order revoking probation for the violation of that condition, the court affirmed the revocation order. The court receded from Mathis v. State, 683 So. 2d 634 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 4th 1996) to the extent that case permitted such an appeal. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 924.06(2) (1997) limited appeal to review of proceedings that occurred after the entry of the order of probation. The court found that the testimony of the probation officer that he found defendant in unsupervised contact with children in her yard and home was sufficient to support a finding of willful, deliberate violation of the condition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order revoking defendant probationer's probation, because defendant, having accepted the benefit of probation in return for acceptance of special conditions, was precluded from challenging the validity of the provisions on appeal from an order revoking probation, and because the order was supported by substantial evidence and was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother petitioned for termination of appellee father's parental rights, and the paternal grandparents petitioned for visitation. Appellee had custody of the children following the parties' divorce. He shot and killed his girlfriend while the children were in the house, and was convicted of murder. The children moved in with appellant. The trial court denied appellant's petition for termination of appellee's parental rights, but granted the grandparents' request for visitation. On appeal, the court found appellant met her burden to show that appellee's murder of the children's mother figure at the time, in their home, demonstrated egregious abuse and abandonment such that continuation of appellee's parental relationship with the children would be harmful and against their best interest. The court instructed trial court to grant termination petition of father's parental rights. The court also reversed the order granting the grandparents visitation because appellant's right, as a sole surviving parent, to privacy protection overcame the grandparents' interests, and where there was no evidence of abuse or neglect by mother or stepfather, the state could not intervene.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida) convicting him on a plea of first-degree murder and giving him a life-sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life on his own plea, filed a writ of mandamus which was denied, and then appealed the amending of his right to a parole hearing every two years by Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 947.174 (1997) to every five years. He alleged that this change violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of U.S. Const. Art. I, &sect; 9 and of the Florida Constitution. The court disagreed, noting that the change was narrowly structured and afforded due process protections. The court further found that the change did not constitute increased punishment, but rather was an administrative change in the method by which parole eligibility would be determined for a limited class of prisoners. The court therefore denied the defendant's petition for mandamus and affirmed the lower court's denial of the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decision to deny the defendant's writ of mandamus was affirmed because the amendment was not violative of the Ex Post Facto Clause of U.S. Const. Art. I, &sect; 9 because it did not increase his punishment but was rather an administrative change limited to only a few prisoners.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction for sexual battery, and reversed the conviction for lewd and lascivious acts. The court held that the crimes were mutually exclusive if based on the same act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Circuit Court for Volusia County (Florida) convicting him of strong armed robbery and sentencing him to 15 years imprisonment pursuant to the Prisoner Releasee Reoffender Act, Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 775.082(8).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the Prison Releasee Reoffender Act violated the separation of powers doctrine because it divested the trial court of sentencing discretion. The court upheld the statute against the due process challenge. The statute had been recently considered by several other district courts and upheld consistently against challenge. Setting penalties for crimes was a substantive matter for the legislature, but courts in Florida had uniformly rejected arguments that mandatory sentences violated the separation of powers doctrine and accordingly, the court rejected the argument that this statute was unconstitutional by requiring a mandatory minimum sentence. The court found no merit in the other issues raised regarding the sufficiency of evidence to support the conviction. While a possible challenge regarding the veto power of the victim stood out, no party briefed the issue and the court refused to consider it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for strong armed robbery was affirmed because there was no merit to the allegation that there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction. The sentence imposed was affirmed and the Prisoner Releasee Reoffender Act was upheld because the Florida courts had long upheld mandatory sentencing requirements against separation of powers challenges.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment. The judgment was reversed to the extent that it declared Fla. Stat.

The order of partitioning was reversed. Partitioning of the land required the consent of all heirs of the estate and while defendant was awaiting the execution of a prior court order directing the sale of the real property to herself, defendant was not given notice of the partitioning suit, which was no fault of her own. Constructive notice that a will had been recorded would not permit the closing agent to represent that defendant gave consent to the partitioning.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the writ of certiorari and quashed the order that granted the prosecution's motion for a change of venue. While there was difficulty sitting the sixth juror on the third jury to be impaneled, the record did not establish an exhaustive attempt to seat a jury before declaring a mistrial or that additional effort would not have proven successful. There was no exception for the effects of media coverage or community mood. Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 16(a) unequivocally guaranteed defendant the right to stand trial in the county where the crime allegedly transpired. Defendant was not obliged to settle for a smaller jury. The court reviewed federal analysis of U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida), denied appellant chiropractors' motions to dismiss state's information charging unlawful insurance solicitation in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 817.234(8) (1997). Reserving the right to appeal the alleged unconstitutionality of the statute, appellants sought review after pleading no contest to lesser charge of conspiracy to commit unlawful insurance solicitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A consulting business referred persons involved in motor vehicle accidents to appellant chiropractors, who later billed victims' insurers for personal injury protection benefits. The state charged appellants with unlawful insurance solicitation in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 817.234(8) (1997). Appellants moved to dismiss, alleging the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and violative of equal protection. When the trial court denied both motions, appellants pleaded no contest to lesser offense of conspiracy to commit unlawful insurance solicitation. However, appellants reserved right to appeal statute's alleged unconstitutionality. Entirely rejecting appellants' arguments, the court affirmed. Finding overbreadth doctrine did not apply, the court applied a four-part test to determine that governmental restriction on appellants' commercial speech did not violate U.S. Const. amend. I protections. Because individuals of common intelligence knew what &quot;to solicit&quot; meant, the statute was not void for vagueness. Finally, because the statute was rationally related to a legitimate state interest, there was no violation of either substantive due process or equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellants' guilty pleas to conspiracy to commit unlawful insurance solicitation, rejecting appellants' constitutional challenge because the statute at issue did not violate constitutional protections for commercial speech, statute was not void for vagueness, and statute was rationally related to a legitimate state interest so that no violation of appellants' substantive due process or equal protection rights had occurred.</SPAN></P>

Among its provisions was a decree that no video games, slot machines, or skill machines were allowed on any premises where a bingo game was being conducted.

Appellees filed a declaratory action challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance as applied to the toy crane machines. The court below rendered an amended judgment declaring that the part of the ordinance regulating skill machines was unconstitutional. That court found that the contested provision failed to pass the rational basis test, the standard for determining the validity of legislation that does not impinge upon constitutionally protected conduct. Specifically, the court found that prohibiting forms of entertainment that were not gambling bore no rational relationship to the county's asserted governmental interests in passing the ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner filed a petition against appellees, various members of the department of corrections, claiming medical malpractice and U.S. Const. amend.

Stat. ch. 766.202(5) in order to substantiate his medical malpractice claims. The reviewing court held that the written medical expert opinion submitted by appellant simply did not comply with the requirements set forth in Chapter 766. Therefore, the reviewing court affirmed the dismissal of appellant's petition. However, the reviewing court held that the failure to comply with Chapter 766's presuit requirements could not result in the dismissal of an action unless it was clear that the claimant could not possibly cure the defect and still maintain the action in compliance with the statutes. Since the trial court's order did not address appellant's Eighth Amendment claims, such claims could have still been viable and the reviewing court was compelled to reverse and remand the trial court's dismissal with prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order from the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County, (Florida) which dismissed her paternity action against appellee on statute of limitation grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed suit for paternity, child support, and attorney fees and alleged that appellee was the father of a child born in 1981. Appellee moved to dismiss all claims based on Fla. Stat. ch. .95.11(3)(b), which provided for a four-year statute of limitations. The trial court granted his motion. On appeal, the reviewing court held that the statute of limitation upon which appellee relied had been found to be an unconstitutional violation of equal protection prior to the birth of the child. The illegitimate child's right of support and enforcement could not be extinguished by law on his or her fourth birthday when a legitimate child's right to support and enforcement would continue. The statute unlawfully discriminated against illegitimate children. The reviewing court therefore reversed the lower courts decision, holding that the statute in question was amended and clarified in 1986 to provide that the four-year period runs from the date the minor child reaches majority. As the child in this case had not yet turned eighteen, it was clear that the trial court improperly applied the predecessor statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reviewing court reversed the lower court's decision. The lower court failed to apply the amended version of the applicable statute. The four year statute of limitations period did not run until the minor reached the age of majority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Fla. Stat. ch. 794.05 (1997), the state charged defendant with statutory rape. Finding no practical differences between a 23-year-old and a 24-year-old engaging in sexual activity with a minor, the Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida) dismissed defendant's information because the classification was unreasonable and arbitrary. The court also held that the statute did not violate defendant's right to privacy. Each party appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 794.05 (1997), defendant was charged by information with unlawful sexual activity with a minor. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information and to declare ch. 794.05 unconstitutional because it violated her right to privacy under Fla. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23, and her right to equal protection under Fla. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The trial court dismissed the information, ruling that although the statute did not violate defendant's right to privacy, it did violate her right to equal protection. Both parties appealed. The court reversed and remanded the trial court's order dismissing defendant's information, holding that ch. 794.05 was constitutional because the age restriction was reasonable and it was not discriminatory, arbitrary, or oppressive. In short, the court found that the legislature's decision to limit criminal responsibility to persons 24 years of age and over was constitutional because it was reasonably related to the goal of protecting minors from sexual exploitation by adults. Balanced against that goal, the statute was not arbitrary. Furthermore, ch. 794.05 did not violate defendant's right to privacy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Despite affirming the trial court's finding that the statutory rape law did not violate defendant's right to privacy, the court reversed and remanded the trial court's dismissal of defendant's information because the classification was neither unreasonable nor arbitrary. Moreover, the legislative goal of protecting minors from sexual exploitation by adults was a rational basis for limiting criminal responsibility to persons over 24 years of age.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida), sentencing him under the Prison Releasee Reoffender Punishment Act, Fla. Stat. &sect; 775.082 (1997), to the mandatory minimum of 15 years imprisonment for committing unarmed robbery one month after his release from prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with unarmed robbery. At trial, evidence was presented that the crime was committed one month after defendant was released from prison. Defendant was found guilty and, upon the request of the prosecution, he was sentenced under the Prison Releasee Reoffender Punishment Act, Fla. Stat. &sect; 775.082 (1997), to the mandatory minimum of 15 years imprisonment. Defendant appealed, claiming the Act was unconstitutional. In affirming, the court ruled that the Act was not impermissibly vague, so as to offend due process. The Act also did not violate equal protection or the concept of separation of powers under Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3, by vesting discretion in the prosecutor and requiring sentencing judges to impose mandatory minimum sentences on those who qualified as releasee reoffenders. Rather, the legislature possessed plenary power in Florida to prescribe the punishment for criminal offenses, and decisions regarding whether to prosecute and seek enhanced punishment were relegated to prosecutors in the executive branch. Judges possessed discretion to exceed the mandatory minimum sentence. Nevertheless, the issue was certified to the Florida Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence was affirmed because the Act did not violate due process, equal protection, or the separation of powers clause of the Florida constitution; it did not deprive the judiciary of all sentencing discretion by imposing mandatory minimum sentences; the legislature had plenary power to prescribe punishments; and the authority to decide who should be prosecuted under the Act was an executive prosecutorial decision.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that when reviewing a downward departure, two questions were to be considered: (1) did the record support that the mitigating factor was actually present; (2) even if the mitigating factor was present, did the trial judge abuse his discretion in departing downward? The court then ruled that the record established that the victim had consented to the sexual relationship, and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in downwardly adjusting appellee's sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida) that determined that certain real property specially assessed by appellant to provide for fire rescue and emergency medical services did not provide a special benefit from the assessment and thereby invalidated the assessment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment that invalidated appellant's special tax assessment against appellee's property. The court reversed and remanded the judgment. The court noted that pursuant to Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2 and Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 166.021, appellant was authorized to impose a special assessment such as the one challenged, which was intended to provide funding for fire and emergency medical services to real property such as appellee's. The court further noted that the review to determine the validity of a special assessment was a two-prong test: (1) whether the services at issue provided a special benefit to the assessed property; and (2) whether the assessment was properly apportioned. The court then ruled that the trial court improperly considered, individually, the intended fire protection benefits, rather than considering fire protection as a whole, and, thus it improperly ruled the assessment invalid because one facet of the fire protection benefit did not actually benefit appellee. Thus, the court ruled, the challenged assessment benefitted appellee's property, and the court, therefore, remanded for a determination of whether the assessment was properly apportioned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded a judgment that declared invalid appellant's special assessment against appellee's real property. Because the assessment, which was made for the purposes of providing appellee's property with fire and emergency medical services, provided special benefits to appellee's property, the court remanded for a determination of whether the assessment was properly apportioned.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida) that granted appellees' motion for judgment on the pleadings in appellants' suit, brought under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, for appellees' failure to notify appellants of the death of their son, which appellants claimed was in violation their due process rights, U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged a judgment that granted appellees' motion for judgment on the pleadings in appellants' 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 suit, which alleged, among other things, that appellees violated their due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV when appellees failed to make adequate efforts to notify appellants of the death of their son. The court affirmed the judgment, analogizing appellants' claims to those raised in another case, wherein it was held that claimants had no protectable property interest in their decedent's dead of body and thus could not challenge the removal of corneal tissue from that body. Nonetheless, the court noted that the alleged conduct in appellants' case was more egregious in the prior case because appellants alleged that appellees' callous indifference to the rights of appellants constituted outrageous conduct and tortious interference with the right of burial. Consequently, the court certified to the state's supreme court, as question of great public importance, whether the prior case precluded all &sect; 1983 claims grounded on interference with an interest in a dead body?</SPAN></P>

The court certified to the state's supreme court the question of whether all such actions based upon interference with interests in a dead body were barred.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 560.615(9), was held to be unconstitutional where it was a special law enacted under the guise of a general law, and where only defendant horse breeder would qualify for a license under the statute. The statute allowed horse breeders to receive a license to engage in intertrack wagering. Plaintiff gaming corporation brought a declaratory action, seeking to have the statute declared an equal protection violation. Plaintiff moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motion, holding that the statute was unconstitutional where it was a special law enacted under the guise of a general law and effected an equal protection violation. The court affirmed, holding the law was invalid as a special law because it created a class that was closed to all but defendant, and that the law violated equal protection where the criteria for obtaining a license bore no reasonable relationship to the object of the law. Because defendant was the only applicant that would ever be eligible for a license, the law was constitutionally invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida), which imposed a five-year sentence under the Prison Releasee Reoffender Punishment Act, Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 775.082(8), after she was convicted of battery on a law enforcement officer and criminal mischief. She claimed that the statute was facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to plaintiff state's request, defendant was sentenced as a prison releasee reoffender (PRR), pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 775.082(8), and was given the mandatory maximum sentence of five years. Defendant appealed her sentence, arguing that &sect; 775.082(8) was facially unconstitutional because it gave the ultimate sentencing decision to the prosecutor, in violation of the doctrine of separation of powers, and because it violated the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 by denying her the right to an unbiased sentencing process and a meaningful opportunity to be heard. On appeal, the court affirmed and upheld the statute's constitutionality. The discretion given to plaintiff under &sect; 775.082(8) to seek an enhanced mandatory sentence was similar to that given to the plaintiff in deciding what charges to bring against a criminal suspect. Moreover, under &sect; 775.082(8), defendant had the right to present her own evidence, and the statute was rationally related to the legislative objective of discouraging recidivism in criminal offenders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that sentenced defendant, pursuant to plaintiff state's request, as a prison releasee reoffender (PRR) after she was convicted of battery on a law enforcement officer and criminal mischief. The court held that the PRR statute, under which defendant was sentenced, was constitutional because it did not violate the separation of powers doctrine or defendant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was driving his employer's vehicle when he was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. The vehicle, which was registered in the name of defendant's employer, was impounded pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 316.193(6)(d). Defense counsel filed a motion, purportedly on behalf of defendant and his employer, asking the court to declare the statute unconstitutional, arguing that the statute improperly authorized the governmental taking of an innocent owner's property without due process. The trial court granted the motion and the prosecution appealed. The reviewing court held that the employer did not follow the proper procedure for attacking the impoundment of the vehicle. The court said that the employer was not a proper party before the criminal court because it was not a party in the criminal action. The court further said that because defendant was not the owner of the impounded vehicle, he could not challenge its impoundment. Having concluded that neither of the parties could properly raise the constitutional challenge to the statute, the reviewing court reversed the court's determination that chapter 316.193(6)(d) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the record reflected that both plaintiff prosecution and defendant considered the trial as involving two counts with two victims, the defense made no objection to the amendment, and there was no prejudice caused by the amendment. The court held further that the jury instruction regarding defendant's blood alcohol level was valid; there were no undefined terms in the instruction under consideration which might have confused the jury into believing that a finding of impairment was required upon a finding that the blood-alcohol level of 0.08 was established.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence for burglary and aggravated battery. Defendant claimed that the trial court should have instructed the jury on the defense of justifiable use of non-deadly force, arguing that a knife was not necessarily a deadly weapon and that the jury should have been permitted to determine whether the force used was deadly or non-deadly. On review, the court held that deadly force was defined by statute as force likely to cause death or great bodily harm, and if the nature of force used was clearly deadly or non-deadly as a matter of law, only the applicable instruction should be given. The court found that, while a knife was not, by definition, a deadly weapon, there was simply no way to interpret the act of stabbing as being non-deadly. The court distinguished the case from instances where deadly force was not used as a matter of law, such as where an individual impaled himself on a knife that was merely being waved around, because the evidence showed that defendant thrust the knife into the victim's chest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for possession of a concealed weapon by a convicted felon. Appellant filed a motion to dismiss his convictions pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.190 (c)(4), and the trial court denied that motion. Appellant sought the court's review asserting that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss as the knife that he was carrying at the time of his arrest was a common pocketknife under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 790.001 (13) (1995), and not a weapon, because it had a blade that measured less than four inches. The court held that because appellant carried the knife in his pocket in an open, locked position, and because, in his motion to dismiss, he was not specific as to the length of the blade, the question of whether that knife constituted a weapon was a jury question. Further, to the extent that case law had established a per se rule for the definition of common pocketknife, that rule could only be invoked by a defendant who established conclusively that the knife in question had a blade length of four inches or less and that it was carried in the common manner, i.e. in a folded position.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the grandmother of a minor child, challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida) where appellant alleged the trial court erred in not using the &quot;best interest of the child&quot; standard, Fla. Stat. ch. 61.13(7) (1995), in an action for adoption and modification of a final judgment of dissolution which placed custody of the minor child with appellee, the child's natural mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, grandmother of a minor child, appealed from an order in a proceeding for adoption of a final judgment of dissolution that placed custody of the minor child with appellee, the child's natural mother. Appellant argued that the trial court erred in not using a &quot;best interest of the child&quot; standard in making a custody decision under Fla. Stat. ch. 61.13(7) (1995), as between a natural parent and a grandparent with whom the child had been residing in a stable relationship. The appellate court affirmed and held that in a custody dispute under ch. 61.13(7), custody could be denied to the parent only when it was established that the parent had abandoned the child, that the parent was unfit, or that granting custody to the parent would be detrimental to the child. To do otherwise would permit the state to substitute its own views regarding how a child should be raised for those of the parent. Such would involve the judiciary in second-guessing parental decisions, and allow a court to impose its own notion of the children's best interests over the shared opinion of these parents, stripping them of their right to control in parenting decisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the decision of the trial court, in an action for custody of a minor child placing the child with her natural mother instead of the grandmother, with whom the child was residing in a stable relationship because the natural parent had not abandoned the child, or been found to be an unfit parent. Placement with the natural parent been found not to be detrimental to the child's welfare.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 61.13(7).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was the mother of a minor child when appellant's marriage dissolved and primary residential custody was awarded to appellant. Appellant informed appellee paternal grandparents she intended to move out of state and appellees sought custody of the child. The trial court applied the best interest standard under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 61.13(7) and transferred custody to appellee. Appellant challenged the decision, arguing that application of the best interest standard was an unconstitutional infringement on appellant's right of familial privacy. The court relied on a state supreme court decision that held, under the privacy provision of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 23, that a parent had the right to a raise a child without unwarranted governmental interference. The zone of familial privacy could not be invaded in the absence of a compelling state interest. Proof of a substantial threat of significant and demonstrable harm had to be shown. Therefore, the best interest standard under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 61.13(7) violated the Florida constitution and was facially unconstitutional. The decision of the lower court was reversed and the case remanded.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 825.102(3) (1997).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted after her mother died and argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 825.102(3) (1997) was facially unconstitutional because it did not contain a specific intent requirement and violated due process by imposing a duty on appellant to act while penalizing her failure to comply. On review, affirmed. The court found that the legislature had the power to dispense with the element of intent and punish particular acts without regard to the mental attitude of the offender and concluded that the statute withstood a due process attack because neglecting to take action under the circumstances would have alerted a reasonable person to recognize the consequences. The court held that the statute penalized the failure only where appellant assumed the duty to provide basic food, shelter, clothing, and medical needs and rejected appellant's arguments that the statute was unconstitutionally vague or that it violated her mother's right to privacy. The court concluded that the vagueness challenge failed because the record showed that appellant's conduct fell within the conduct proscribed by statute, and constitutional rights were personal in nature and could not be asserted vicariously.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) convicting him of drug charges. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in denying suppression of contraband evidence because it was discovered pursuant to his arrest for violation of an unconstitutional, open container ordinance, Orlando, Fla. Ordinance &sect; 33.08.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment convicting appellant of drug charges. Appellant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence of drugs discovered following his arrest for violation of Orlando, Fla. Ordinance &sect; 33.08. Section 33.08 prohibited the consumption of alcohol as an operator or passenger in a vehicle where such consumption was open to public view. Relying on decisional law, appellant argued that &sect; 33.08 was void as unconstitutional because it conflicted with Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1936, which made an open container offense a non-criminal traffic infraction. The court disagreed because &sect; 33.08 went beyond mere possession of an open container and made it unlawful to drink from a container while in a vehicle and in public view. As in the decision on which appellant misplaced reliance, the local ordinance at issue did not conflict with the state statute on its face, had not been declared void and, therefore, was presumptively valid. Accordingly, the constitutionality issue was not reached, and appellant's arrest and search were the lawful result of an officer enforcing a presumptively valid, local ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed appellant's conviction on drug charges. The appellate court found that the local ordinance at issue did not conflict with state law on its face and, therefore, it was presumptively valid. Accordingly, the arrest and search of appellant pursuant to his violation of the local ordinance was proper, and his motion to suppress contraband evidence was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

Appellee sellers and appellee buyers moved for summary judgment against appellant, claiming that the judgments did not comply with the requirements of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 55.10(1) for creating a lien on real property. The trial court granted summary judgment for appellees. The court affirmed. Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 55.10(1) expressly required that a judgment creditor's address had to be contained in the judgment or in a simultaneously recorded affidavit for the judgment to become a lien on real estate. The address of appellant's attorneys did not satisfy this explicit statutory requirement. The statutory requirement was not a matter of procedure within the exclusive domain of the state supreme court but an issue of substantive law within the legislative domain.</SPAN></P>

Appellant filed a postconviction motion arguing that Thompson required retroactive application on collateral review. The trial court denied appellant's motion and appellant sought review. The appellate court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that under Witt, for a case to apply retroactively, it must (1) emanate from the United States Supreme Court or the Florida Supreme Court, (2) be constitutional in nature, and (3) constitute a development of fundamental significance. The court held that the first prong was clearly met.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant fund members challenged an order from the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida), which granted partial summary judgment to appellee state insurance agency and allowed appellee to assess appellants, members of an insolvent workers' compensation insurance fund, for claims paid by a self insurance guaranty association.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Consumer Self Insurance Fund of Florida (fund) was created to allow employers and private business entities to combine with other employers and entities for the purpose of satisfying workers' compensation coverage requirements for their respective businesses. The Self Insurance Fund Guaranty Association (association) was created to expeditiously pay injured workers' covered claims in the event a self-insurance fund became insolvent. When a fund involving appellant fund members became insolvent, appellee state insurance agency placed it in receivership. The association paid claims and appellee sought reimbursement from appellants. Appellants challenged the assessment for reimbursement and a trial court granted partial summary judgment to appellee. On appeal, the court found that appellee, as receiver, could make assessment for claims under the terms of the fund's indemnity agreement. The court found that the association paid the compensation claims owed by appellants pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 631, and the statute assigned the right of reimbursement to the association. Therefore, the trial court's order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order allowing appellee state insurance agency to assess appellant fund members was affirmed because appellants were liable for appellee's assessment for reimbursement under the terms of their indemnity agreement, after a self-insurance guaranty association paid the claims of appellants' insolvent workers' compensation insurance fund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), finding that defendants' offer of judgment pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 768.79 was made in good faith, and therefore that defendants were entitled to their attorneys' fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued defendants, his former employers, for group boycott under Florida antitrust law, defamation, and interference with a contract. The antitrust claim was ultimately dismissed with prejudice and the court granted summary judgment on the other claims. At the time defendants answered the complaint, they served an offer of judgment on plaintiff for $ 100 pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 768.79. After judgment was entered, defendants moved for an award of attorney fees for plaintiff's failure to obtain a better judgment than that offered by defendants. The court found that defendants' offer was made in good faith and that the requested fees were reasonable. The court of appeals affirmed the judgment, holding that the trial court's findings were supported by the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals affirmed the judgment, holding that the record supported that defendants' offer of judgment was made in good faith and therefore that they were entitled to attorney fees. The record further supported the finding that defendants' requested attorney fees were reasonable.</SPAN></P>
