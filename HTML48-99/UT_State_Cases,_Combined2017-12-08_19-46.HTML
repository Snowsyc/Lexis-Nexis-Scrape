<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, insured and his wife, sought reversal of a summary judgment entered by a Utah trial court in favor of plaintiff insurer. The trial court held that the family exclusion provision in the policy was valid and enforceable, that the insurer was therefore not required to defend the insured in a civil action brought by his wife, and that the insurer was not required to pay any judgment she might obtain in her action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured was the driver in an automobile accident in which his wife was injured. She filed a civil action for damages against her husband. The insurer sought a declaratory judgment action that the family exclusion provision in the policy was valid and enforceable, that the insurer was therefore not required to defend the insured in the civil action brought by his wife, and that the insurer was not required to pay any judgment she might obtain in her action. The trial court, on motion of the insurer for summary judgment, awarded the insurer the relief sought. On appeal, the court adhered to the majority view and held that the household or family exclusion was valid in Utah as to insurance provided by an automobile policy in excess of the statutorily mandated amounts and benefits. While the minority view was attractive from the standpoint of an injured victim, the policy needed to be enforced as written when its provisions did not conflict with the mandatory automobile insurance statutes. The summary judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the police had neither probable cause nor reasonable suspicion for the search; (2) the facts known to the border patrol officers at the time the car was stopped did not justify the stop under even the lesser reasonable suspicion standard; (3) the trial judge's order suppressing the evidence was not clearly erroneous; and (4) the route of travel, national origin of the occupants, California license plates, time of year and day of stop, and nervous behavior of the occupants did not justify the search.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled on a motion in limine that defendant's prior convictions for rape and escape were admissible to impeach defendant's credibility.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault. Aggravated sexual assault was a violation of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-405. There were apparently no eyewitnesses to the assault, and defendant contended that the victim was a prostitute and that he refused to pay her for the sodomy. Defendant appealed his conviction to the court. The court reversed the conviction. The court's reversal was on the basis that the trial court by ruling on a pretrial motion erroneously refused to suppress defendant's prior convictions for rape and escape. Pursuant to Utah R. Evid. 609(a), a prior conviction was admissible to impeach a defendant where the prior conviction was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year and the probative value of admitting it outweighed its prejudicial effect or where the conviction involved dishonesty or a false statement regardless of the punishment. The court found that the rape conviction was too prejudicial and old--10 years old--to be admitted. The court also found that the escape convictions were too old--5 years old--to be admitted. Remoteness in time, per the court, reflected on probative value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. The reversal was based on the failure to exclude the prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgments of a trial court (Utah), which convicted him on charges, brought by the State of Utah, of distributing a controlled substance for value in violation of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 58-37-8(1) (a) (ii) (1986) (amended 1987) and distributing a controlled substance for no value in violation of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 58-37-8 (1) (c) (1985) (amended 1986; repealed 1987). Defendant's appeals were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant twice provided marijuana at the instigation of an undercover police officer. Both parties agreed that the drug buys were transacted outside of the officer's jurisdiction and that the officer did not comply with Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-9-3 (1982). The court rejected the State's contention that the officer's investigation was that of a private citizen without the mantle of police authority. The court concluded that the officer clearly acted outside the scope of his statutory authority when he conducted the investigations. However, the court determined that in the circumstances of the cases, suppression of the evidence obtained as a result of the illegal investigation was not an applicable remedy. In addition, the court disagreed with defendant's assertion that the evidence in both cases was insufficient to support his convictions for distribution of a controlled substance. Specifically, defendant argued that he merely arranged the sale between the officer and a third party. The court ruled that it was the prerogative of the trial judges to decide how much weight to give defendant's testimony that he merely acted as an intermediary for the source of the drug.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of six offenses including aggravated sexual assault, for which he received the mandatory sentence. On appeal, defendant asserted that the minimum mandatory sentencing provisions were unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the aggravated sexual assault statute,&nbsp;&sect; 76-5-405(2), when read along with the minimum mandatory sentence provision, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-3-201(5) (Supp. 1983) (amended 1984, 1986, 1987) was not vague. Section 76-5-405(2) provided that the commission of a prohibited sexual act accompanied by a specific aggravating circumstance was punishable by imprisonment for a minimum mandatory term of 5, 10, or 15 years. Section 76-3-201(5) mandated the term of middle severity unless there were circumstances in aggravation or mitigation of the crime. The court concluded that &sect; 76-5-403(2) was not unconstitutionally vague. An aggravating circumstance in addition to the one triggering the aggravated sexual assault charge clearly required imposition of the mandatory term of greatest severity. The trial court had sufficient evidence of several aggravating circumstances to impose the sentence of greatest severity. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

Some four years and six months after the accident, the patrons filed their complaint against the city. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the city. The patrons sought review, contending that neither the one-year limitation period of the Utah Governmental Immunity Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-15 (1978), nor the four-year negligence statute of limitation, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-12-25(2) (1977), were applicable in barring their action. Affirming the district court's judgment on appeal, the court held that summary judgment was proper because the complaint was untimely under the seven-year statute of limitation, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-12-25.5, which applied to defective or unsafe improvements to real property. The court further held that because the personal injury action was not commenced within seven years of completion of construction of the tubing hill, it was time-barred.</SPAN></P>

Other witnesses to the robbery were unable to testify that defendant had a gun. A jury convicted defendant of aggravated robbery. Defendant appealed.

The court reasoned that there was insufficient evidence to establish that a firearm or a facsimile thereof was used in the robbery as required for aggravated robbery in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-6-302.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents gave birth to a child, who exhibited signs of an undiagnosed neurological disorder. The parents alleged that the doctors advised that they could safely have another child. The parents proceeded to have a second child, who soon developed signs of the same neurological impairments. Both children were diagnosed as having a rare, genetically transmitted, and progressively degenerative neurological disorder. The parents brought an action against the doctors and the state. Plaintiff minor joined in the action against the doctors and the state, seeking damages for wrongful life. The lower court entered summary judgment for the state as to the parents' claim on the ground that the parents had failed to file a notice of claim against the state within one year as required by Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-12 (1986). The lower court, however, denied summary judgment in favor of the state as to the minor's claim. The court also awarded summary judgment in favor of the doctors as to all claims on the ground that a 1978 amendment to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-4 granted immunity to them for their simple negligence in the performance of their duties as state employees.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alleged victim contended that the trial court improperly concluded that his claim was barred by a four-year statute of repose contained in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-14-4 (1-2) (1987). He contended that &sect; 78-14-4 (1-2) was unconstitutional. The alleged victim contended that the doctor fraudulently concealed the legal injury. The court held that the trial court properly determined the action. Since the latter two issues had been raised for the first time on appeal, the court declined to address them. The trial court appropriately observed that the &sect; 78-14-4(1-2) was stated in two parts. It was not only a statute of limitation; it was also a statute of repose. The court held that &sect; 78-14-4(1-2) begins to run from the time the alleged victim knew or should know that he had suffered an injury. But in any event, &sect; 78-14-4(1-2) requested that the alleged victim's action have been commenced within four years after the date of the incident which caused the injury. The court held that the four-year statute of repose barred the alleged victim's cause of action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted by a trial court (Utah) of aggravated robbery, aggravated assault, and theft. He appealed, seeking reversal of his convictions and a new trial. The convictions were based upon the robbery of a jewelry store, in which the clerk and a customer were forced into a bathroom at gunpoint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the search of his car went beyond the constitutional scope of an inventory search, that there was insufficient evidence with which to convict him of aggravated assault, that a jury instruction regarding the possession of stolen property unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof, and that, under the facts, theft was a lesser-included offense of aggravated robbery. The court ruled that defendant was correct as to the last point and reversed the theft conviction. Affirming the remaining convictions, the court ruled that the impoundment and inventory search of defendant's car were proper. The officers were justified in searching the trunk, its contents, and under the hood, and in opening a jewelry box found in the trunk and unwrapping a towel found under the hood. Further, the court concluded that, since there was sufficient evidence that defendant was one of the men robbing the jewelry store, he was responsible for the aggravated assault, either as a principal or an aider and abetter. The court also held that a jury instruction regarding the possession of stolen property did not unconstitutionally shift the burden of proof to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in part and reversed the theft conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver's vehicle was struck by a vehicle driven by the passenger's girlfriend. The passenger was not wearing a seatbelt and struck the top of his head against the interior of the vehicle and injured his knee. The passenger was granted an interlocutory appeal from the order granting a new trial. The court affirmed the order granting a new trial. The court determined that the trial court was correct in granting a new trial on the issue of causation because the passenger's evidence as to causation was inadequate to support the award made by the jury. The court noted that there were several factors that created substantial doubt regarding the causal relationship between the auto accident and the passenger's subsequent physical problems. The court explained that the jury verdict was improper in that it imposed liability on the driver for injuries not shown by the evidence to have been proximately caused by the driver's conduct. The court concluded that it was self-evident from the trial testimony that many of the passenger's problems at the time of trial were the result of the criminal assault that occurred well after the accident giving rise to the action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court, which granted the driver's motion for a new trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's preliminary hearing was not held until more than four years after he was charged with the crime. Defendant's trial was held approximately two months after the preliminary hearing. Thus, defendant challenged his conviction on the grounds of lack of a prompt determination of probable cause and denial of a speedy trial. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. Although the court found that the 54-month delay between arrest and trial raised legitimate questions concerning the speedy disposition of defendant's case, the court concluded that the delay, when balanced with other factors, did not deny defendant his constitutional right to a speedy trial. The court found that defendant shared the blame for the delay, that defendant did not assert his right to a speedy trial, and that defendant was not prejudiced by the delay. While the court did not condone the state's failure to promptly provide a preliminary hearing, defendant's own conscious decision not to seek a prompt preliminary hearing and the lack of prejudice to defendant convinced the court that the state's gross violation of Utah R. Crim. P. 7(c) did not merit reversal.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that the admissibility of polygraph test results in the absence of the consent of both parties was not a firmly settled question in Utah. Moreover, the court held that the time an offense was committed was generally not an element which the prosecution had to prove at trial and that where the declarant was not absent but was present to testify and to submit to cross-examination, the admission of his out-of-court statements did not create a confrontation problem under the federal constitution.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the employee again underwent two knee surgeries. When the fund refused to pay for the surgeries, the employee filed with the commission, which held a hearing and appointed a medical panel. The panel considered both operations and found that neither was necessitated by the 1979 accident. The employee objected to the medical panel's report and requested a hearing. The ALJ rejected his request for a hearing and adopted the medical panel's report in his findings of fact and conclusions of law. On appeal, the employee argued that he was entitled to a hearing because he objected to the medical panel's report. The court affirmed the ALJ's denial of a hearing because Utah Code Ann. &sect; 35-1-77 (1986) provided that such hearings were discretionary.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that driving was a privilege, not a right, and consent to laws was not a prerequisite to their enforceability. The court held that the alleged jurisdictional errors could not be reviewed because they went to the authority of the justice of the peace. The court also could not consider defendant No. 1's claim that his conduct did not amount to a violation of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 41-6-13, which required compliance with lawful orders of police officers.

He was previously convicted of the unlicensed practice of medicine for purporting to diagnose and treat stomach pains as cancer and mercury poisoning.

Issues not preserved by objection were waived and not reviewed. Defendant had not shown that a criminal violation of the statute by unlicensed prescription to the gullible and unwary public was a constitutionally protected activity. His conduct was within a narrow constitutional construction of the statute's intended prohibition, so he could not complain it was overbroad so as to prohibit conduct not applicable to his case.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following his arrest, defendant refused several police requests to take a breathalyzer test. At no time was he advised that his refusal to take the test could be admitted into evidence during any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of the incident. On appeal, the court noted that discussion about and the conclusions reached by the United States Supreme Court in a relatively recent case were helpful in its analysis. The court interpreted art. I, &sect; 12, the similar provision in the Utah Constitution, in the same manner in the case at bar. The court held that a refusal to take a breathalyzer test was not an act compelled by the state and was thus not protected by the art. I, &sect; 12 privilege against self-incrimination. Further, evidence of the refusal to take the test was admissible in evidence and did not offend the art. I, &sect; 12 privilege against self-incrimination or the right to due process. The court reviewed defendant's other issues on appeal and found them to be wholly without merit. The court affirmed the convictions and the judgment upholding them.</SPAN></P>

Vol. 6A, 1974, 1985 Supp.). Defendant asserted, among other things, that the warrant to search his residence was issued in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A search warrant was issued based on an officer's affidavit that a confidential informant told him that a person who lived at defendant's address possessed one-half pound of cocaine, that the officer verified the tip, and considered the informant reliable because his previous tips had led to three other drug related arrests. The prosecutor revealed that these statements had been false but attributable to another officer, and the trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained via the warrant. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, finding that the warrant was valid even though the officer's affidavit was false, since he made the affidavit based on another officer's statements. Because the other officer had direct knowledge of the facts upon which the warrant was issued, and officers are presumed to tell one another the truth, the court found that the use of hearsay in the affidavit had not invalidated the warrant. The court held that because a warrant could have been issued on double hearsay, the magistrate could have issued it had the officer attributed the facts in his affidavit to the other officer, thus the warrant was valid.</SPAN></P>

His wife had friends in the same apartment complex of the owner where it was stored in the basement. There was testimony at trial that defendant had been seen with the saxophone but that, when confronted, he contended it was his. On appeal of his conviction, defendant contended U.C.A., 1953, &sect; 76-6-402 (Utah) established an unconstitutional presumption that one in possession of recently stolen goods was guilty of having stolen it and he contended an instruction based thereon was erroneous. The court found the instruction only established an inference of guilt where justified by the facts and this was permissible. Though possession alone could not establish a conviction, there was other evidence presented at trial. The court also found that defendant's decision to testify to rebut mounting evidence against him did not increase pressure on him to testify and violate his Fifth Amendment right. Defendant only had a privilege against his wife's testimony as to confidential communications with him; he could not prevent her from testifying at all.</SPAN></P>

The husband appealed the property division and attorney fees award, and the wife cross-appealed the custody award. The court affirmed and found that the husband failed to establish the existence of the loan, and, therefore, the property award was without error. The court found that because the wife's testimony alone was sufficient to establish her need, the partial attorney fees award was proper. The court determined that its earlier caselaw, which demonstrated a maternal preference in custody matters, was invalid, and overturned those precedents in favor of function related factors. The trial court correctly applied the factors, and, therefore, the split custody award, while not favored, was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' application for water service to their leased premises was denied because the property owner had not signed the application, as required by Salt Lake City, Utah, Rev. Ordinances &sect; 49-6-1 (1981). Plaintiffs' suit to compel defendant to provide water service was dismissed. On appeal, the court held that defendant had no duty to provide water to plaintiffs. Defendant was authorized by Utah Const. art. XI, &sect;&sect; 5 &amp; 6; U.C.A., 1953, &sect; 10-8-14(1) (Repl. Vol. 2A, 1983 ed., Supp. 1985), to operate a waterworks. However, U.C.A., 1953, &sect; 54-2-1(20)(a), (35) (Repl. Vol. 6A, 1974 ed., Supp. 1986), specifically excluded defendant from doing so as a public utility, so defendant had no duty to provide water service to all members of the public. The court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutional because it encompassed a legitimate purpose and objective and did not create an unconstitutional classification to achieve that objective. All property owners were treated equally. It was reasonable to require owners to bear the ultimate responsibility for water service because it was easier to collect from them. Landlords, not defendant, had placed tenants in a separate category.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the provision was severable because the remaining portions of the Act could have stood alone and it served a legitimate legislative purpose. Noting that what was public purpose varied and changed with the times, the court explained that it could not have determined that the stimulation of Utah's economy and the creation of employment was not a legitimate public purpose. Whatever the court's private views on the matter might have been, the court conceded that the legislature's determination that a public benefit resulted from the Act was within its latitude. The court also held that the authorization in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-60-4(4)(c) for the UTFC to hire and retain independent legal counsel did not violate Utah Const. art. VII, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>

The court further found that the State's failure to preserve the body for testing for gunpowder residue did not violate defendant's right to exculpatory evidence where the body remained unidentified and was cremated long before any prosecution. However, the court found that defendant could not be convicted of theft and aggravated robbery, as well as first degree murder, because theft merged into aggravated robbery. The robbery then merged into the murder conviction because the jury did not specify whether the aggravating circumstance it considered was robbery, pecuniary gain, or other personal gain. Consequently, the court found that aggravated robbery, under these circumstances, was necessarily a lesser included offense of first degree murder and it vacated the theft and robbery convictions, while affirming the murder conviction and life sentence.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff appealed, claiming that &sect; 35-1-72 was unconstitutional in that it violated the Supremacy Clause, the Due Process Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, and the plenary power of Congress to control the immigration and naturalization of aliens.

The State alleged that the defendants signed for two purchases using a credit card of another individual. After a motion was filed on behalf of one defendant arguing that U.C.A., 1953 &sect; 76-6-506.1 (Repl. Vol. 8B, 1978, Supp. 1985) and U.C.A., 1953&nbsp;&sect; 76-6-506.2 proscribed the same conduct and that the defendant had the right to be charged with the offense that carried the lesser penalty. The trial court dismissed the charges as to both defendants. The State appealed. The court reversed the order. The court found that the State had the authority to appeal the order. The State properly suggested that the trial court formally dismiss the information due to its determination that the charges should be reduced to an offense carrying a lesser penalty because the trial court's determination blocked the prosecution from going forward with its case. The court also found that the statutes did not proscribe the exact same conduct and were distinguishable. Section 76-6-506.2 did not require proof of a signing of a sales slip and did prove of the value of the fraudulently purchased items.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected defendant's contention that Utah's state laws and officials unconstitutionally impeded his fundamental and unrestricted right to travel and that the state was without power to impose reasonable and necessary regulation on the use of motor vehicles. The court held that Utah's legislature had the power and duty to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of all citizens and that conditions and regulations for the operation of motor vehicles on Utah's public roads were a proper subject for legislative action. The court held that the statutes defendant violated did not unconstitutionally deprive him of any claimed right of locomotion, due process, or equal protection of the laws. The court held, however, that defendant was improperly denied a jury trial under U.C.A., 1953, &sect; 77-35-17(d) (1982 ed.), having made a timely demand for one. The court rejected the State's argument that the issue was unreviewable because defendant relied exclusively on the U.S. Constitution and failed to assert his statutory right to a jury trial, stating that it could not ignore the fact that defendant had a right to a jury trial, that he requested one, and that it was denied.</SPAN></P>

When applying the standard to determine whether to admit a co-conspirator's hearsay statements, the court could consider the accused's own statements indicating her involvement in the conspiracy, Utah R.

The court held that a conspirator's statement may be provisionally admitted, subject to eventual independent proof of the criminal venture and the defendant's participation therein.

The board found that the attorney violated the rules of conduct and recommended that he be suspended for 30 days and required to pay complainants the money he owed as a condition of reinstatement. The court affirmed, finding that the attorney's behavior was subject to the bar's disciplinary power because it involved more than a mere business dispute. The attorney held his clients' money in a fiduciary capacity to pay the debts owed to complainants, but failed to uphold his fiduciary duty in violation of fundamental standards of honesty. The attorney's due process rights were not violated by the bar counsel's involvement in both the prosecutorial and adjudicative phases of the disciplinary proceeding because the bar counsel did not adjudicate the case, but merely prepared findings, conclusions, and recommendations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to capital homicide in exchange for a promise that he would be sentenced to life imprisonment rather than death. The trial court accepted the plea, but two weeks later the trial court ruled that it was not bound by the agreement to impose life imprisonment. The court held that there no constitutional infirmity in the trial court's setting aside the condition of the plea. The court found that the trial court, in agreeing to the plea, had violated the provisions of Utah R. Crim. P. 11 because the trial court participated in plea discussions prior to any agreement being made with the prosecuting attorney. The court noted that jeopardy attached upon acceptance of the guilty plea, but the constitution allowed the trial court to rescind its acceptance at any time before sentencing and judgment upon a showing of manifest necessity. Since the prosecuting attorney had not agreed to the plea, a misplea could properly be granted where obvious reversible error had been committed in connection with the terms or the acceptance of the plea agreement and no undue prejudice to the defendant was apparent.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and determined that the adoptive parents' petition was filed in good faith and that there was no evidence of fraud. The court that the statute, fair on its face, could have been void and unenforceable as applied. The court found that the statute would have been void as violative of basic notions of due process if the father was unable to come forward within a reasonable time after the child's birth and assert his parental rights. The court noted that because the father was not in Utah at the time of the child's birth, because the father and mother made plans to live together in Arizona, and because he relocated and found employment in Arizona, the father was unaware of the child's birth and that the termination of his parental rights was contrary to basic notions of due process.</SPAN></P>

A Utah trial court awarded summary judgment to the defendants, airplane manufacturer and owner on the ground that the statute of repose, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-15-3 of the Utah Product Liability Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-15-1 et seq.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On its face the Utah statute of repose for product liability cases barred the action because it was filed more than six years after the date of first sale for use or consumption, or ten years after the date of manufacture. The immunity from suit protected all manufacturers and all persons in a manufacturer's chain of distribution, from the manufacturer to the last seller. The court found that the statute was not aimed at abolishing nuisance suits, but rather it precluded injured plaintiffs' judicial remedies in wholly meritorious cases. The court held the statute violated Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The legislature, under the guise of a limitation provision, did not have the power to cut off an existing remedy entirely, since amounted to a denial of justice, and, manifestly, an existing right of action could not be taken away by legislation which shortened the period of limitation to a time that had already run. The court held that the elimination of all causes of action after the period specified in the Act was arbitrary, unreasonable, and did not achieve the statutory objective. The remainder of the Act, not being severable from was also invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The survivor filed a wrongful death action on behalf of herself and her children for the death of her husband who died in an airplane crash. The survivor brought the action against the manufacturer, owner, and pilot of the plane. The plane had been in operation about 23 years at the time of the crash and had been owned by the owner for approximately nine years. The trial court awarded the manufacturer summary judgment on all theories of liability on the ground that the statute of repose, &sect; 78-15-3 of the Utah Product Liability Act (Act), Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-15-1 et seq. (1953), barred all actions against the manufacturer. The survivor appealed and the court reversed. The court held that the statute of repose was unconstitutional, noting that the time periods in the Act were arbitrary, that the statute of repose had not achieved its avowed purpose of reducing manufacturers' insurance premiums, that the number of claims barred did not affect insurance premium rates, and that the statute provided manufacturers less incentive to take adequate safety precautions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insurance company sought reversal of a grant of summary judgment in defendant's favor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insurer sought reversal of a summary judgment in favor of defendant insured in an action seeking a declaratory judgment of plaintiff's obligations under an insurance policy containing a household exclusion clause. Defendant appealed the part of the trial court's order that limited the coverage and denied her recovery of attorney's fees. On appeal, the court affirmed that a household or family exclusion policy was contrary to the Utah No-Fault Insurance Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 31-41(1) et seq., and the Safety Responsibility Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-12-1 et seq, as well as the public policy of the state. The court then reversed that part of the decision of the trial court that limited defendant's recovery to the minimum statutory amount. The court held that since the plaintiff failed to disclose the exclusion to the defendant in writing, the exclusion clause was invalid as to the entire policy limits. Finally, the court affirmed the trial court's ruling denying defendant recovery of attorney's fees since the plaintiff insurer had a right to bring an action for a declaratory judgment in what appeared to be a justiciable controversy.</SPAN></P>

The defendant's request for a bill of particulars was denied and the State insisted on a jury trial, even though defendant waived his right thereto. The court held that defendant only had a constitutional right to a jury trial, not a bench trial. Thus Rule 17(4)(c), Utah R. Crim. P., which allowed the State to veto defendant's waiver of jury trial was not unconstitutional. The court also found that defendant was entitled to more than the broad statement in the information that the crime took place within a two-week period, if the State had any information whatsoever that would have narrowed the time period. However, because defendant failed to supply a trial transcript on appeal, the court was not able to determine whether defendant was unable at trial to mount whatever defense or defenses he had against the charges. Defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced by a lack of a bill of particulars.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of burglary, a second-degree felony under U.C.A., 1953, &sect; 76-6-202, and theft, a second-degree felony under U.C.A., 1953, &sect; 76-6-404. They appealed from the judgment of a trial court (Utah), contending that the trial court erred in denying their motion to suppress, in failing to direct the disclosure of a confidential informant's identity, and in charging the jury in the language of U.C.A., 1953, &sect; 76-6-402(1) (Utah).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The informant told police officers of a burglary. He took one of the officers to meet one of defendants in an undercover operation. The officer bought an item from defendant. That item was reported stolen the following day. A search warrant was issued, and other stolen items were seized from that defendant's residence. The court held that the defendants' motion to suppress the seized evidence properly was denied. Probable cause was established under the totality of the circumstances test. If there was error in failing to direct the disclosure of the informant's identity, that error was harmless. Defendant who sold the item to the officer knew the informant's identity. The jury erroneously was instructed in the language of &sect; 76-6-402(1) that possession of stolen property, when no satisfactory explanation was made, was prima facie evidence that the person in possession stole the property. Section 76-6-402(1) was directed to the trial court to provide a standard for determining whether the State's evidence warranted submission of the case to the jury. As a jury instruction it was unconstitutional. It directly related to the issue of guilt and relieved the State of its burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

After he was sentenced under U.C.A., 1953, &sect; 41-2-30(2), to a $ 437 fine and 75 days in jail, he appealed, claiming that drivers who drank were unconstitutionally singled out in violation of their equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">U.C.A., 1953, &sect; 41-2-30(2) (Supp. 1983) (Utah), provided that if a license were previously revoked for driving while under the influence, a driver was fined up to $ 1,000 or given one year in prison or both. Under U.C.A., 1953, &sect; 41-2-30 (Supp. 1983) (Utah), driving with a revoked license for other reasons provided for six months in jail and a $ 299 fine. On review, the court rejected the equal protection argument, ruling that such classification of those convicted of drunk driving and the imposition of a stiffer penalty were entirely reasonable and within the legislature's power over the safe use of vehicles. The court explained that the conditions for operating motor vehicles on public roads was a proper subject for state regulation and that those who drove while intoxicated could be punished to a greater extent because they were dangerous to others' health, safety, and welfare. In addition, the court refused to consider a lack of probable cause claim as it was raised for the first time on appeal, and the court ruled that defendant's objections to the amendment of his citation and an excessive sentence did not raise constitutional issues and were not reviewable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation brought an action against defendants for a partial refund of its 1981 property taxes previously paid under protest. The county filed two cross-claims against the commission and one counterclaim against the corporation. The district court ruled that the county lacked standing and dismissed the cross-claims and counterclaim. The county appealed and the court reversed and remanded the case. The court found that if, as alleged, the corporation's state-assessed mining properties were underassessed, then the county suffered some distinct and palpable injury that gave it a personal stake in the assessed value of state-assessed properties. By alleging underassessment of locally assessed properties, the corporation put the valuation of its own state-assessed properties at issue. Accordingly, the county was entitled to raise the issue of the valuation of the corporation's property. The court held that in challenges to mining assessments, if the tax division of a district court found a commission order in error, the tax division of the court could only reverse and remand the matter to the commission for a proper determination pursuant to correct legal standards.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a county and related others, sought review of a decision of a Utah trial court, which declared the challenged portions of the Emery County, Utah Business License Ordinance unconstitutional and beyond the county's statutory authority, enjoined any further efforts to enforce the provisions in question, and ordered the county to refund money paid by plaintiff coal company pursuant to the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs had challenged &sect; 7-3 of the ordinance, which requires all businesses subject to the ordinance to pay an additional fee of one-half of one percent of the fair market value of all goods and services sold or originating within the county to the extent such value exceeded $ 150,000 per year. On review, the issue addressed by the court was whether the &quot;additional fee&quot; provision of the ordinance was in excess of the licensing authority granted to counties under U.C.A., 1953, &sect; 17-5-27 (1973) (Utah). Stated differently, the question was whether the Utah legislature had authorized counties to use their licensing power to tax. Affirming, the court held (1) that although there was authority in support of both constructions of &sect; 17-5-27, it approved of the holding in prior precedent that &sect; 17-5-27 did not permit counties to raise revenue through licensing except insofar as such revenue was necessary to regulation of the licensed entities; and (2) that the trial court's finding that the revenue to be raised from the additional fee provision of the ordinance was intended as a general revenue measure with little if any regulatory purpose or effect was amply supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fugitive was sought by the demanding state. He was arrested in Utah as a fugitive from justice, pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-30-13 (1982) of the Act. The fugitive challenged his incarceration and extradition proceedings by three successive petitions for a writ of habeas corpus. The trial court denied the fugitive's petitions. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the fugitive should have been permitted to present fugitivity evidence in his pre-warrant hearings. However, the fugitive was accorded due process because he chose to file a second habeas petition rather than appeal the dismissal of his first petition. Further, the fugitive was not effectively denied his right to appeal the denial of his post-warrant habeas petition because the responsibility for any failure of a settled statement to reflect what happened at the post-warrant hearing rested with the fugitive. Finally, the fugitive's incarceration for almost two years without bail did not violate the fugitive's due process rights because the confinement resulted from the fugitive's own choices.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, with a blood alcohol content three times the legal level of intoxication, ran a red light and struck another vehicle. He was convicted of manslaughter. On appeal he claimed that it was error to strike the testimony of his expert witness and to deny his motion to dismiss or to reduce the manslaughter charges. The court reversed the judgment below and remanded for resentencing. Under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-2-306 (1953), the testimony of the psychologist, that at the time of the accident defendant was in an alcoholic blackout and was unable to consider risk, was immaterial. The court also ruled that defendant was entitled to the lesser punishment in &sect; 41-6-43.10 of the motor vehicle code for negligent homicide, rather than for manslaughter under the criminal code. Recklessness and reckless disregard of the safety of others, as the terms appeared in the manslaughter and negligent homicide statutes, meant the same thing. The legislature was able to make automobile homicide committed recklessly either a misdemeanor or a felony but not both. It was impermissible to leave the choice to a prosecutor because equal protection required like treatment of all those similarly situated.</SPAN></P>

On one occasion the mayor shot and killed one of the dogs. One of the citizens found the carcass of his dog on the mayor's property. The citizen and four other citizens brought an action against the mayor for malfeasance in office. The jury found the mayor guilty of malfeasance in office and removed him from office. The mayor challenged the ruling. The court affirmed the trial court. The court reasoned that because the mayor at trial never asserted his right against self-incrimination the issue was not preserved for appeal. Further, the court concluded that as to the removal procedure, the mayor did not have a right to an instruction that differed from that to which he would have been entitled in any civil proceeding and under Utah R. Civ. P. 47(q) a verdict in a civil proceeding only required the concurrence of three-fourths of the jurors. Removal proceedings were statutory proceedings not of common law origin, and therefore where the constitutionality of the statute was not in question the court had no basis to consider the wisdom of the procedures set forth in the statute.</SPAN></P>

The government's interest in effective law enforcement and its legitimate need for the type of information provided by a breathalyzer test outweighed the basis of the privilege against self-incrimination, that of respect for the citizens by the government. The court determined that art. I, &sect; 12 was limited to those situations where the government sought evidence of a testimonial or communicative nature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission imposed the $ 25,000 fine and placed the carrier on probation for illegally operating as a motor carrier of bulk cement. The carrier appealed. The court affirmed because it was undisputed that the carrier held a certificate to operate as a common carrier by motor vehicle but was not authorized to carry bulk cement. The conclusion that the carrier engaged in a subterfuge was also supported by the fact that the monetary consideration to be paid by the concrete manufacturer was to be the same whether the carrier delivered the cement as a contract carrier or as a private carrier under the purchase-resale arrangement. Under either plan, the concrete manufacturer was the carrier's only customer, and the sum the concrete manufacturer was obligated to pay to the carrier was the purchase price of the cement plus the transportation fee. The only profit to the carrier was generated out of the transportation fee. In addition, the statutory penalty imposed was clearly not a criminal penalty, but was a civil penalty imposed by the commission in its quasi-judicial capacity for the purpose of enforcing the law and to compel conformance with its regulations governing motor carriers.</SPAN></P>

The utility proposed to construct a transmission line to the boundary of its territory and, from there, to connect to a transmission line constructed by the corporation. The corporation's line was to extend across the cooperative's territory. The cooperative filed a complaint with the PSC, which engendered the above order. The court affirmed, holding that the delegation of authority to the PCS under Utah Code Ann &sect; 54-7-4.5 (Supp. 1983) to issue cease and desist orders was accompanied by adequate guiding standards and procedural safeguards and was constitutional.Also, the PSC had the authority to issue the order under the facts of the instant case.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's contended that the firearm count should have been severed from the burglary and theft charges. The court held that the failure to sever the charges of possession of a firearm by a restricted person from the burglary and theft charges was an abuse of discretion. The joinder of the offense of possession of a firearm by a restricted person with the offenses of burglary and theft was unduly prejudicial to defendant under Utah R. Crim. P. 9. But for the joinder, evidence that defendant was at the time of the offenses committed to the state prison and living in a halfway house would have been inadmissible at trial on the burglary and theft charges. This evidence clearly implied that defendant had committed a prior crime. Therefore, the court reversed defendant's convictions of burglary, theft, and possession of a firearm by a restricted person and remanded the case for retrial. Since defendant's habitual criminal conviction was based on the above convictions, the habitual criminal conviction was reversed also.</SPAN></P>

Three people were working under the hood of that vehicle, and, as a result of the accident, one was slightly injured, a second lost a leg to the knee, and the third victim lost both legs at the hip. Defendant was arrested, and a blood sample revealed an alcohol content at .19. Defendant was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol. The court held that the district court properly found that (1) the circuit court found that defendant's intoxicated driving caused injuries, (2) criminal negligence was the proper standard and that the circuit court properly found defendant had driven her car in a criminally negligent manner, and (3) the imposition of the one-year sentence under &sect; 41-6-44(d) was supported by the record, and the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the maximum sentence.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff filed suit against defendants. The court declared the UGS unconstitutional. Defendants petitioned for a rehearing, claiming that the ruling should be applied prospectively only. They argued that the UGS had been held to be constitutional when the accident occurred. The court denied the petition for rehearing. The court held that generally a decision, even an overruling decision, was given both prospective and retrospective application, unless the challenged statute had been justifiably relied on and complete retroactive application would have irreparably burdened those relying on it. Defendants did not allege that they justifiable relied on the court's prior decisions sustaining the constitutionality of the UGS. There was no evidence that defendants knew of the UGS and relied upon it in offering a ride to plaintiff. An equal protection argument was not an adequate reason to prohibit retroactive application of the court's decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A water management agency and others instituted action against the CUWCD challenging the provision of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 73-9-9 (1953), as constituted prior to its amendment in 1983, that provided for appointment of water district directors by the district court. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of CUWCD and determined that &sect; 73-9-9 was constitutional. The court held there was a justiciable controversy because some of the directors that were currently serving had been appointed by the judiciary. The court reversed the decision of the district court. The court held that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 73-9-9 (1953) was unconstitutional to the extent that it vested power in the district court to appoint directors of water districts because it compromised the separation of powers contemplated in Utah Const. art. V, &sect; 1. The court held that its decision was to have prospective application only. To the extent that the court's precedent attempted to hold that the power of the court to appoint the board of directors of water conservancy districts was constitutionally sound, it was expressly overruled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a ticket taker at a movie theater, appealed a decision from a trial court (Utah), which, upon her guilty plea, convicted her under an information charging her with a violation of U.C.A., 1953, &sect; 76-10-1204, the distribution of pornographic material.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted that the tickets were to a movie that she knew to be pornographic. Defendant received the mandatory minimum sentence of seven days in jail. The court affirmed. Pornography was not protected by the First Amendment. The penalty in the present case, a mandatory seven-day jail sentence, could have been considered severe because defendant was only a ticket taker, but her plea of guilty admitted that she knew the films were pornographic, which indicated involvement in a criminal enterprise. Given the nature of the problem that the statutory scheme addressed, the mandatory minimum sentence was not disproportionate. A mandatory minimum sentence for one who was knowingly involved in the distribution of pornography, even in a relatively insignificant way, was not unreasonable. In the context of the instant case, the court also held that the minimum sentence did not violate Article I, &sect; 9 of the Utah Constitution, which prohibited &quot;cruel and unusual&quot; punishment. The court also rejected a First Amendment &quot;chilling effect&quot; challenge because a conviction was statutorily dependent on defendant's knowledge that the material distributed was pornographic.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the order. The court determined that under U.C.A., 1953, &sect; 17-30-2 (Supp. 1983), the sheriff of a county with a population of 20,000 people or more had to appoint peace officers from a merit service list furnished by the Merit Service Commission (Utah). The court explained that such provisions of the statute were mandatory. The court noted that under U.C.A., 1953, &sect; 17-5-12, where a cause of action existed to recover unlawfully paid money, the county attorney of the county where it was alleged that funds were illegally expended had to be the party bringing the action, and the action had to be in the name of the county. The court concluded that there was no indication that the county was ever requested to bring an action or that he refused to do so.

The statute contained so many exceptions that it was not uniform in application as required by &sect; 24 of the Utah Constitution.

Respondent state contended that the statutory provision for valuation of the property, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-34-11, required that valuation be set as of the date of service of process. The owners argued that the extraordinary delay of eight years between service of process and condemnation of the property was caused not by them but by environmental and funding issues. They presented evidence that the value of the property had substantially appreciated before the right to condemn was established. The court granted the owners an interlocutory appeal. The court concluded that the statutory provision for valuation as of the date of service of process was a rebuttable presumption and that the right to just compensation protected by Utah Const. art.

At trial, the parties stipulated as to the negligence of the driver. Summary judgment was granted in favor of the driver on the issue of the constitutionality of the Utah Guest Statute. The statute barred a nonpaying passenger injured in an automobile accident from suing the owner or driver of the automobile for ordinary negligence if the injury occurred on a public highway. Upon review, the court analyzed the statute using the equal protection standard under Utah Const. art. I &sect; 24 which stated that all laws of a general natured had to have uniform operation. Moreover, U.S. Const. amend. XIV prohibited states from enacting laws that denied any person within its jurisdiction equal protection of the laws. As such, persons similarly situated had to be treated similarly. Further, under Utah Const. art. I &sect; II, every person for an injury done to him had to have a remedy by due course of law. The statute denied a remedy to guest passengers and as such, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a declaratory judgment action against defendant Utah State Tax Commission, plaintiff broker/dealer company (broker) sought review of a decision of a district court (Utah), which declared that the sale of precious metals, bars, medallions, United States coins, and foreign coins such as South African Krugerrands by the broker were subject to the sales tax under U.C.A., 1953, &sect; 59-15-4(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question on appeal was whether rare United States coins, foreign coins, and precious metals were money or &quot;tangible property&quot; as that term was used in &sect; 59-15-4(a), which imposed a tax on every retail sale of tangible personal property made within the State of Utah. Regulation S26 of the Utah Sales and Tax Book of Regulations (Regulation A12-02-S1:S26) stated that tangible property did not include notes and other evidence of debt. On appeal, the court affirmed. The broker's transactions were clearly commodity transactions rather than money transactions. The coins transferred by the broker, both domestic and foreign, were transferred as an investment commodity and were tangible personal property. When sold for their intrinsic value and their face value was not insignificant, coins were tangible property. South African Krugerrands possessed an intrinsic value in the form of once ounce of fine gold, the value of which fluctuated with changes in the world market in precious metals; the value of those coins did not possess an unfluctuating denominated value set by the issuer.</SPAN></P>

The father's efforts to assert paternity following the birth were unavailing and the child resided in the adoptive home for three years. The court affirmed the district court's decision that dismissed the father's request for habeas corpus relief. The court was not persuaded by his contention of being denied liberty without due process of law because &sect; 78-30-4 did not provide for actual notice of the statutory procedure for establishing his parental rights. The court followed apposite precedent to rule that there was no constitutional requirement that &sect; 78-30-4 afford actual notice of the statutory requirements for establishing paternal rights.

The corporation was a public utility that distributed power at retail. Pursuant to a contract, the association supplied and transmitted power to some of the corporation's consumers at wholesale. During that time, the corporation paid rates parallel to the charges of the Utah Power &amp; Light Company's Resale Service Schedule (UP&amp;L). When UP&amp;L's wholesale rates were reduced, the association received a refund for the amount it had been overcharged for the power it had purchased for resale to the corporation. The corporation requested a refund from the association of more than five times the amount given to the association. The Commission determined that the corporation correctly calculated the amount due and ordered the association to issue a refund. In affirming the Commission's order, the court held that the Commission had jurisdiction over the parties. In addition, the Commission did not exceed its statutory authority in ordering a refund and the order was supported by the necessary factual findings that justified exercise of the Commission's authority to interpret the contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother, unaware of the father's intention to assert paternity, placed the child for adoption with the society. The child was placed with adoptive parents within a week of its birth. The father's paternity form was filed two days later. Although the father failed to timely acknowledge his paternity as required by &sect; 78-30-4(3), the trial court granted his claim for custody of the child because it found that the law was unconstitutional as applied to the father because he was denied a reasonable opportunity to file his acknowledgment of paternity prior to placement of the child. On appeal the court held that the statute had been constitutionally applied to the father and reversed the trial court's judgment. Citing U.S. Supreme Court precedent and the state's strong interest in protecting the best interests of illegitimate children, the court held that the statute was not offensive to either the federal Due Process Clause or Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The court noted that the birth occurred in the same state as the father's residence, and neither the mother nor the society was involved in any effort to prevent him from learning of the birth or from asserting his parental rights.</SPAN></P>

The claimants sought judicial review of adverse decisions from defendant Department of Employment pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 35-4-10 (1953) after their appeals to the Board of Review of the Industrial Commission obtained the claimants only partial relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants were instructed by the department orally and in writing that, in order to remain eligible for benefits, they must each make either two or three in-person contacts with potential employers each week. Each of the claimants later signed a form acknowledging failure to make the required number of contacts. Each claimant's benefits were then denied and overpayments of benefits were to be repaid for weeks during which the claimants were ineligible. The court evaluated each of the claimants' cases found that the department's &quot;two to three in-person contacts&quot; rule was only a guideline, not an administrative rule requiring formal adoption, and that it had been flexibly and subjectively applied to each claimant's circumstances. The court examined several cases cited by the parties and concluded that the claimants also received due process of law because neither the Social Security Act, specifically 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 503(a)(1) and (3), nor the state or federal constitutions required a pretermination evidentiary hearing before unemployment benefits were denied. The court held that, under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 35-4-6(d), the claimants properly were held liable for overpayment of benefits.</SPAN></P>

The utilities claimed that U.C.A., 1953, &sect;&sect; 59-5-4.5a and 59-5-109 (Supp. 1981) (Utah), which reduced the value of county-assessed property and rolled back the assessed value of those properties, were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utilities owned state-assessed properties in the county. Pursuant to U.C.A., 1953, &sect;&sect; 59-5-4.5a and 59-5-109 (Supp. 1981) (Utah), in assessing property for ad valorem taxes the county had reduced the value of county-assessed property and had rolled back the assessed value of those properties. Reasoning that the reduction on assessments of county-assessed properties increased state-assessed properties' share of taxes, the utilities claimed that the reductions and roll-backs, without comparable reductions and roll-backs for state-assessed property, constituted non-uniform taxes, and violated Utah Const. art. XIII, &sect; 3, and the federal equal protection clause. Stating that the Legislature could to seek to enforce the uniformity requirement of art. XIII &sect; 3, by attempting to equalize the tax burden borne by those taxpayers who pay a greater tax in proportion to the value of their property than others, the court held that U.C.A., 1953, &sect; 59-5-4.5 (Supp. 1981) (Utah) was constitutional. However, insofar as U.C.A., 1953, &sect; 59-5-109 (Supp. 1981) (Utah) froze the value of some properties at a given point in time, and not others, it resulted in unconstitutional nonuniform assessments.</SPAN></P>

A noncontractual claim for public benefits enjoyed no constitutionally protected status.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death by a Utah trial court. Defendant appealed his conviction and death sentence, alleging several errors including denial of an instruction on the lesser included offense of second degree murder, ineffective assistance of counsel, and use by the jury of the wrong standard in sentencing him to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the jury should have been instructed on second degree murder due to depraved indifference. The court affirmed the conviction and held that if the jury believed the medical testimony, they could have acquitted defendant of the charged offense. The evidence provided no basis for the jury to convict defendant of the depraved indifference variation of second degree murder. At the time of this shooting, that crime required proof that the accused had recklessly caused the death of another, whereas defendant admitted that he had deliberately shot the tellers. Defendant also argued that the death penalty should be set aside because the jury used the wrong standard in deciding whether to sentence him to death or life imprisonment. While defendant's direct appeal from his conviction was pending the court changed the standard to &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; both as to the fact that total aggravation outweighed total mitigation and as to the conclusion that the imposition of the death penalty was justified and appropriate in the circumstances.

The court found that the protected activity had a direct relation to the public's interest in regulating alcohol and protecting minors. It was designed to protect the public interest and was not arbitrary. The court also found the sweep of the ordinance was not too broad since it only applied to persons operating or employed in an establishment that sold beer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The university denied the students' request for resident status because they had not lived in Utah continuously for one year prior to that school quarter.

The students filed an action to compel the university to classify them as residents for tuition purposes. The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the university, holding that: (1) the students' due process rights were not violated because they could have established themselves as bona fide state residents by overcoming the rebuttable presumption of non-residency under Utah Board of Regents R. I.C., (2) the students' equal protection rights were not violated by the 30-day rule under Utah Board of Regents R. I.D. because the state, in determining whether the one-year residence requirement had been met, could rationally distinguish between students who resided outside the state for a period of more than 30 days during the one year and those who did not, and (3) the university did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in denying the students' request.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant shot her husband to death, she was found not guilty by reason of insanity. Based on expert testimony that she had a mental illness and was committable, the district court committed her. Pursuant to U.C.A., 1953, &sect; 77-14-5(2), effective July 1, 1981, she sought a hearing to determine whether she had recovered her sanity, and she attacked the constitutionality of &sect; 77-14-5. Finding that defendant had not recovered from mental illness, the district court ordered criminal and involuntary civil commitment. Affirming, the court held that &sect; 77-14-5(2) was not void for vagueness. The dual commitment did not violate her due process rights because it bore a reasonable relationship to the purpose for which she was committed: treatment and protection of defendant and the public. Moreover, it was not overly restrictive because she was automatically entitled to release from the civil commitment if she satisfied her burden of proving recovery from mental illness under the criminal commitment statute. Finally, dual commitment did not deny defendant equal protection because it was constitutionally permissible to treat insanity acquittees differently from persons committed civilly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, two convicts, had filed essentially identical original petitions for post-conviction review in the court pursuant to Utah Code. Ann. &sect; 78-2-2 (1953) and Utah R. Civ. P. 65B. Both convicts were in the process of seeking disposition on petitions for writs of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Utah when the court issued its opinion in the case of State v. Wood.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Consideration of those petitions was stayed by the federal district court pending a decision in the state courts as to whether or not State v. Wood would result in reversal of the convicts' sentences of death. On this second round of petitions for collateral review, the issue was whether the Wood holding had to be applied retroactively to the convicts' cases. The court determined that due process and equal protection considerations did not require the retroactive application of its decision in Wood to the convicts' cases on collateral review. Accordingly, the court denied their petitions for habeas corpus and post-conviction relief. The court found that the absence of a Wood instruction had virtually no prejudicial impact on the convicts' cases because of the comprehensive review afforded their sentences on appeal and collateral review. Thus, no purpose would have been served by applying the Wood standard retroactively. If a reversal were required by virtue of that retroactive application, considerable violence would have been done to the principles of finality and fairness in litigation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated arson after he set a house on fire, allegedly at the owner's direction. Defendant appealed his conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected defendant's argument that he could not be convicted of arson because the owner could not be convicted for such offense under &sect; 76-6-103 and defendant was acting as the owner's agent. Defendant's argument was not supported by the language of the statute. Both the arson statute,&nbsp;Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-6-102 (1953, 1978 ed.), and the reckless burning statute,&nbsp;Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-6-104 (1953, 1978 ed.), distinguished the property of another from other types of property. Section 76-6-103 made no reference to ownership of the property and was applicable to an owner. In addition, a review of the preceding statutes indicated that the legislature did not intend to exclude the burning of one's own property from &sect; 76-6-103. The court held that &sect; 76-6-103 was a proper exercise of the legislature's police power and therefore it would not substitute its judgment for that of the legislature with regard to what best served the public interest.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part and held that the taxpayer's action alleging that local school districts were prohibited from hiring state legislators during the term of their office was properly dismissed because absent some claim of specific injury that was casually related to the alleged illegal activity, the taxpayer did not meet the standing test of having a personal stake in the controversy. On the other hand, the taxpayer clearly had standing to demand a refund of her 1980 property tax based on the claim that the tax statute was unconstitutional because the constitutionality of a tax statute could be raised in an action properly filed pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-11-1 in the district court.</SPAN></P>

In their appeal, defendants argue that the trial court erred in refusing their request to have the jury instructed on the lesser included offense of manslaughter. The court affirmed their convictions concluding that defendants were not entitled to have the jury instructed on the lesser included offense of manslaughter because the evidence did not provide a rational basis upon which the jury could have acquitted two of the defendants of second degree murder and convict them of manslaughter. The court concluded that since there was no evidence that one of the defendants, as an accomplice, had acted recklessly or under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance or with a reasonable belief that the circumstances provided a moral or legal justification or extenuation, there was no basis in the record to convict her of manslaughter on the theory that she was an accomplice of another defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mineral owner challenged the lower court's order. The court noted that the mineral owner refused to enter into a voluntary pooling arrangement with the operator of the drilling unit.

The mineral owner contended that he was entitled to a royalty on his interest, free from any share of the costs of drilling, through such time as the board ordered the forced pooling. Although the operator contended that the mineral owner was not entitled to a share of production prior to pooling, it offered to let the mineral owner share in the proceeds, minus the cost of drilling. The court held that the mineral owner had a vested right to a royalty prior to pooling, but that he was not entitled to a cost-free royalty. Accordingly, the court affirmed the lower court's order. However, the court remanded the matter to the lower court for its remand to the board with directions to add interest on the net amounts due on the mineral owner's working interest.</SPAN></P>

The store owner was convicted of delivering drug paraphernalia. The court reversed the conviction and held that while the statute was facially constitutional, it required that the state prove that the store owner knew that the buyer's intent was to use the products illegally. The state presented no evidence as to what the store owner knew or did not know concerning the sale. The state did, however, present evidence as to the buyer's intent. The buyer intended only to buy the items to gather evidence to be used to charge the store owner under the U.D.P.A.; she did not intend to use the items with controlled substances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After plaintiff husband's wife left him, plaintiff filed an action against defendant companion for alienation of a wife's affections. Defendant represented himself in the action and did not receive notice that the trial date had been set until two days before the trial. A judgment was taken against defendant for past and future loss of consortium and punitive damages. Defendant's timely motions for a new trial and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict were both denied. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the notice of trial was constitutionally deficient as to defendant because it described the proceedings against him in such ambiguous terms that it deprived him of adequate time to prepare his defense. Therefore the court remanded the cause for a new trial. The court also held, to guide the trial court on remand, that it would not abolish the cause of action for alienation of affection. The court held that the causal effect of defendant's conduct must have outweighed the combined effect of all other causes. The court held that to recover punitive damages, plaintiff was required to show circumstances of aggravation in addition to the malice implied by law.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment and held that: (1) the department's findings were not arbitrary and capricious because they were supported by substantial evidence and the committee's decision on the issue of the meaning of &quot;unprofessional conduct&quot; was reasonable; (2) the committee could define &quot;unprofessional conduct&quot; on a case-by-case basis under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 58-1-13(6); and (3) the revocation did not deprive the osteopathic physician of due process of law because the committee member was a de facto officer.</SPAN></P>

Before his preliminary hearing, a circuit judge, in response to the State's motion, ordered defendant to surrender hair, body and pubic hair samples together with saliva and blood fluids. In the district court, defendant made a pretrial motion to suppress the samples on the basis that the circuit court judge was without jurisdiction to issue the discovery order. The motion was denied. The district court also refused to sequester the jury or to poll them concerning their possible exposure to prejudicial publicity about defendant's prior rape convictions. Defendant was convicted. Defendant appealed. The court held that the district court properly denied defendant's pretrial motion to suppress because the circuit court had jurisdiction to compel discovery, there was no procedural irregularity, and no claim of abuse of discretion in the discovery order. The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to sequester or poll the jury because the record contained no evidence of any pretrial publicity that was potentially prejudicial and ample evidence of the district court's appropriate efforts to forestall prejudice.</SPAN></P>

The sixth count alleged a continuing course of conduct throughout the marriage. The husband filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted by the trial court. The wife sought review and the court affirmed, holding that Utah's one-year statute of limitations had run on all of the wife's claims. The court found that there was no question that the statute of limitations contained in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-12-29(4) had run on the first five claims because all of the events that gave rise to the action occurred more than one year before filing. The court also found that the statute had run as to the sixth cause of action because a reasonable construction of that count was that it was grounded in assault and battery. The court further found that the wife's action had not been tolled by reason of the recognition of the doctrine of interspousal immunity during the statutory period. The court said that the wife was free bring her action during that time.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that under &sect; 18-115, the presumption of being under the influence was rebuttable, but under Murray City, Utah, Code &sect; 18-115.1, it was not. The court examined the legislative history of Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-6-44(a), (b), 41-6-44.2(a), from which the language of Murray City, Utah, Code &sect; 18-115, &sect; 18-115.1 was copied and held that the legislature intended to qualify &sect; 18-115, the earlier statute, to include an irrebutable presumption that attached to the higher BAC level in Murray City, Utah, Code &sect; 18-115.1. Appellant then contended that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 41-6-44.3 (1953) permitted the introduction of inadmissible hearsay in the form of evidence obtained from a breathalyzer, in violation of his rights under the Sixth Amendment and Utah Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from the affirmance of his pornography conviction, defendant argued, in part, that numerous deficiencies in the trial transcript made it impossible for the court to adequately review the threshold claim of actual bias. The court agreed with defendant, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case. The inadequacy of the transcript of the voir dire phase required a new trial because, when faced with claims of potential jurors' responses that demonstrated actual bias, the court was not at liberty to assume what those answers showed when they were totally absent from the record and could not be reconstructed by agreement of the parties. Further, the district court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury that acquittal was required if the jurors could not agree on a definition of current community standards respecting pornography. Whether the material violated the community standard as viewed by the average person was a factual determination. There was no requirement of an independent factual determination of what the community standard on pornography was in the abstract.</SPAN></P>

The district court found that the extradition was legally sufficient. Plaintiff contended that, in order to extradite him as an adult, he first had to be certified to stand trial as an adult. The court disagreed. Plaintiff was not charged with a crime in Utah and was thus not a juvenile named in a juvenile court petition. A juvenile fugitive could be extradited. Moreover, under U.C.A., &sect; 78-3a-25(7) (1981 Supp.) (Utah), a person 16 or older accused of a felony had no right to a certification hearing before being prosecuted as an adult.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant rancher appealed a decision of a trial court (Utah), which entered judgment for plaintiff farmers pursuant to the Utah livestock fencing statute,&nbsp;Utah Code Ann. &sect; 4-25-8 (1953), in their action seeking damages for injury to their crops and irrigation pipe caused by the trespass of the rancher's cattle on their farm land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The rancher's cattle drifted onto a badly fenced field and fed on a growing crop all winter essentially destroying it. The farmers alleged that the rancher was liable under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 4-25-8 (1953) for damage to the crop and plastic irrigation pipe. The rancher contended that the Utah fencing statute violated his due process rights under the federal and state constitutions and that the evidence of damages was speculative. The court affirmed the judgment of liability and remanded for findings on damages. The court noted that Utah had both open range land and large areas of crop land and stated that even though some other states reversed the common law rule and required livestock to be fenced out of crop land, it was clearly reasonable for the legislature to allocate liability by allowing counties to enact fencing ordinances and, in the absence of such an ordinance, by providing that the owners of trespassing livestock were liable. The court found that it was unable to ascertain from the trial court's figures how the damage award was computed, and pointed out that the findings failed to indicate whether there was any salvage value in the pipe.</SPAN></P>

The depositors filed an action against the state and the commissioner and claimed that the depositors' money was lost because the state and commissioner failed to discharge their duties under state statutes to regulate the finance company. The state and commissioner moved to dismiss based on the depositors' failure to comply with the Utah Governmental Immunity Act (the Act), Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-1, et seq., by failing to file written notice of their claim within a year. The trial court dismissed the action for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The depositors sought review. The court found that the regulation of financial institutions was an exercise of a governmental function, that the state was immune under the Act, that the depositors had failed to timely file a written notice of their claim, that the commissioner was not representatively liable because the state was not liable, nor was he personally liable because the Act precluded personal liability for acts committed in the scope of his employment, absent gross negligence, fraud, or malice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following reorganization in her department in the city government, the former employee (employee) was offered a demotion. She declined the position and later terminated her employment. She was granted unemployment compensation benefits and the city appealed the award to the Industrial Commission (commission). The court first held that it was limited to determining whether the commission's findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence. The city contended that the Employment Security Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 35-4-5(a) (Supp. 1981), precluded an award of compensation because the employee voluntarily left work. However, even when an employee quit voluntarily and without good cause, benefits could be awarded if the commission found that it would be contrary to &quot;equity and good conscience&quot; to impose a disqualification. Here, the commission determined that the city wrongfully refused the employee the higher-level position. The city's determination was based on a clearly unfair and inequitable evaluation. The employee was fully qualified, trained, and experienced for the job. The employee could expect to be treated with a degree of fairness and honesty.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court should have informed the jury of the effect of apportioning 50 percent or more of the negligence to the decedent. The court affirmed the admission of the testimony regarding the physiological and psychological effects of marijuana use where the evidence showed that the decedent had walked out into the street in front of an oncoming truck, that he faltered while in that perilous position, and that he had used marijuana within minutes of the accident. The court held that the doctrine of last clear chance as a distinct tort doctrine was extinguished along with contributory negligence and affirmed the trial court's refusal to give the &quot;last clear chance&quot; instruction. The court held that the trial court erred in excluding the driver's guilty plea to a criminal homicide charge, but that the guilty plea did not constitute negligence per se.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the owner of a private club, sought review of decisions of defendant Utah Liquor Control Commission (commission), which revoked the owner's state liquor store lease. The court considered whether Utah Code Ann. &sect; 32-1-32.6 (1953) violated the state's guarantees of due process in Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 7 and of access to the courts in Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Without affording the owner any notice, the commission held a public meeting and, without conducting any evidentiary hearing, decided to revoke the owner's state liquor store lease. On appeal, the court held that, by allowing the owner to be deprived of its lease without notice, hearing, or any judicial review, &sect; 32-1-32.6 offended against both the Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 7 guarantee of due process and the art. I, &sect; 11 guarantee of access to the courts. The owner held a property interest in its liquor store lease to which constitutional due process protections applied. The last sentence of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 32-1-32.6 could not constitutionally preclude all judicial review of the commission's actions. Therefore, the court effected the minimum necessary disruption of the statutory scheme by holding only the final sentence of &sect; 32-1-32.6&nbsp;unconstitutional. The ban on district court review of commission action was left intact, along with the statutory pattern of direct review in the court, which was expanded to include review of actions pertaining to the suspension or removal of state liquor stores from leased premises, as the state constitution required. The court vacated the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated and set aside the commission's order of revocation of the owner's state liquor store lease.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was convicted upon a jury verdict of aggravated sexual assault in violation of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-405 (1953), appealed from the trial court (Utah), which convicted him, contending that the trial court erred in denying him access to his presentence report under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-18-1(2) prior to sentencing and that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of another crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sexual assault based on evidence that he kidnapped a woman in her car and sexually assaulted her before she escaped. The court affirmed the judgment, but vacated the sentence because Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-18-1(2) was not intended to make disclosure of a presentence report depend on a personal whim or subjective standard of the trial court. Fundamental fairness required that defendant had the right to inspect the presentence report prior to sentencing so that a sentence was not influenced by inaccurate information. By denying defendant the right to inspect the presentence report, his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel at the time of sentencing was seriously impaired if a judge relied on information that could have been inaccurate. Had disclosure of the presentence report jeopardized the life or safety of third parties, deletions could have been made from the report to protect them. The court also held that impeachment evidence of the manner in which defendant returned home following the crime, via a stolen car, was a collateral issue and inadmissible, but that it was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for sexual assault but vacated the sentence.

The tax commission denied the lodge's application for a tax exemption for the lot and building. Although the lodge did not expressly waived the right of review and trial de novo in the tax division of the district court, the lodge brought a petition for a writ of review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Attorney General, part of the executive department, contended that it was the legal advisor to the defendants, as defendants were state officers. The court disagreed, holding that under the state's constitution, the Attorney General's authority to act as legal adviser extended to the constitutional executive officers referred to in Utah Const. art. VII, i.e., the Governor, Lt. Governor, Auditor, Treasurer, and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the departments over which they have direct supervisory control, and to the other state executive offices referred to in art. VII, insofar as the officers of those offices acted within the scope of the duties of such office. None of the defendants were executive department officials, having been created by the legislature. Further, in various statutory provisions, the legislature specifically authorized defendants to employ independent counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contended that &sect; 78-6-10 was unconstitutional under Article I, &sect; 24 of the Constitution of Utah. The court held that the district court properly determined the action. Under &sect; 78-6-10, plaintiff could appeal only from a judgment against him granted on a counterclaim to defendants. The district court's judgment on plaintiff's own complaint was conclusive upon him. Plaintiff had the choice of filing his complaint in the small claims court, a circuit court, or the district court, all of which would have concurrent jurisdiction in the matter. Having chosen the least costly forum and the most expeditious method of litigating his claim, plaintiff was bound by the rules of procedure in that forum. Under &sect; 78-6-11 (Utah), an appeal by plaintiff from an adverse judgment on his own complaint would afford plaintiff a trial de novo or two choices of forum. This would entirely defeat the objective of speedy adjudication of small claims. The court did not find it to be unreasonable, nor a denial of equal protection, for the legislature to deny plaintiff the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the Utah Division of Family Services (DFS), appealed an order of a juvenile court (Utah), which granted defendant mother's motion to dismiss the petition to terminate her parental rights to her four-year old child, and held that the 1980 amendment to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-3a-48(1) (1953) violated the Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In granting the mother's motion to dismiss, the juvenile court held that the 1980 amendment to &sect; 78-3a-48(1) was a violation of the mother's substantive right to liberty, privacy, and family integrity as guaranteed by the Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments, and that the amendment was void on its face for vagueness in contravention of procedural due process of law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment and Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 7. On appeal, the court found that the 1980 amendment, by using the &quot;child's best interest&quot; standard for terminating parental rights, deleted a statutory protection for the parental rights of fit parents. The appeal was not moot because the 1981 amendment did not change the &quot;child's best interest&quot; standard and a decision would still affect the rights of the litigants. The court held that under the U.S. Constitution and the Utah Constitution, a parent had an inherent and retained right to maintain parental ties to his or her child. The mother was entitled to a showing of unfitness, abandonment, or substantial neglect before her parental rights were terminated. The 1980 amendment made no provision for that showing and was unconstitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the juvenile court's order in favor of the mother.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Asserting numerous errors in both the guilt and penalty phases of his bifurcated trial, defendant challenged a judgment from the District Court for Tooele County (Utah), which convicted him of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death. A prior per curiam opinion and order of the appellate court sustained the conviction but vacated the death sentence, and the appellate court now issued this opinion to explain its reasons for doing so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction and death sentence for a first-degree murder committed during a robbery. Defendant's accomplice, pursuant to a plea bargain, pleaded guilty to robbery and testified against defendant. The victim was killed when the pair gave him a ride while the victim was carrying a can of gasoline back to his van where his wife and children waited. At trial, each assailant blamed the killing on the other. In addition to challenging his conviction, defendant argued that mitigation evidence showed that he had no prior criminal record and that he might have organic brain damage from extensive alcohol abuse. The single aggravating circumstance was the ruthlessness and brutality of the murder. The trial court imposed the death penalty even though it found substantial doubt that the death penalty was appropriate. The appellate court affirmed the conviction, but vacated the death sentence because of three errors below. The appellate court found that the lower court applied an erroneous standard of persuasion in the penalty phase, gave improper weight to the sole aggravating factor, and erred in failing to order a psychiatric examination for use in the penalty phase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction for first-degree murder but reversed the sentence of death and remanded for the lower court to resentence defendant to life imprisonment. Concluding that the sentencing process was flawed because the aggravating factor relied on was constitutionally impermissible, the court also rejected the proposition that the death penalty could be imposed when there was substantial doubt whether it should be.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile appealed from an order finding him subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-3a-1 (1953), for violating a state law, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-404 (1953), for the crime of forcible sexual abuse.

Upon appeal, the court held that the type of touching with the intent of causing substantial emotional or bodily pain penalized in the felony of forcible sexual abuse necessarily included the misdemeanor of performing &quot;an act of gross lewdness under circumstances which he should know will likely cause affront or alarm.&quot; The court held that the touching involved did not constitute the felony of &quot;taking indecent liberties,&quot; as it was the brief touching of a clothed buttocks that was the conduct in issue, but that the juvenile performed &quot;an act of gross lewdness&quot; and was therefore subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the district court's declaration that portions of Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 20-1-7.1 and -7.6 and Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-3a-8, requiring senate confirmation of judiciary appointments, offended the separation of powers doctrine under Utah Const. art. V, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that declared that the law requiring the senate's confirmation of the governor's judicial appointments was unconstitutional under the separation of powers doctrine. The court reversed, however, the district court's judgment declaring the law authorizing the legislature to create and participate in the judicial nominating commissions unconstitutional under the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>

He contended that the legality of his restraint was not rendered moot by a proceeding before the magistrate and his release on bail, under the provisions of U.C.A., 1953, &sect; 77-7-23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was arrested, but not brought promptly before a magistrate because of a mix-up about which magistrate should have conducted his preliminary examination and because of the delaying effect of a probation officer's telephone request that he be held by the sheriff. While the sheriff was holding petitioner, his counsel petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, citing that he had not been taken before the magistrate &quot;without unnecessary delay&quot; for the review of charges and evidence and the fixing of bail, as required by U.C.A., 1953, &sect; 77-7-23; and that he had not been provided a written statement of the nature of his alleged violation of probation. That day the district court brought petitioner and respondent before the court, heard evidence, and ordered that petitioner be taken before the magistrate forthwith and then be released upon posting the bail fixed by that officer. The court affirmed and held that once the magistrate held the preliminary hearing and specified a bail bond, the illegality petitioner had challenged was entirely resolved, and the habeas corpus petition was thereby rendered moot.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with making a false insurance claim and filing a false report of a criminal offense.

The court rejected both arguments and affirmed the verdicts and judgments. The court held that the challenged comment made by the prosecutor was well within the latitude approved in by case law, which allowed a wide range of argument to the jury. Moreover, the court held that the statute was constitutional because it did not, as defendant erroneously contended, call for a punishment of &quot;theft.&quot; Rather, the statute provides for punishment in the &quot;manner prescribed for theft,&quot; which was used for the purpose of pronouncing and service of sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant protestants challenged an order of respondent Public Service Commission of Utah, which denied a refund of the rate increase granted to an electric utility. The utility and the protestants sought review by the court when the Commission initially granted the rate increase. The court reversed the order and remanded to the Commission for further consideration. The Commission allowed the same increase. The protestants then filed this action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court had reversed the Commission's order granting the rate increase because of an inconsistency in the findings and the order. After additional hearings, the Commission made new findings of fact supporting the same rate increase as initially allowed. The protestants then filed this action, contending that the Commission was required by Utah Code Ann., 1953, &sect;&sect; 54-7-16 and 17 to order a refund. The court disagreed. These sections dealt only with impounding portions of rates authorized by an order under appellate review when certain statutory conditions were complied with. Section 54-7-17 provided that the court could stay or suspend the operation of the Commission's order. However, it was required that a suspense bond should first have been executed. The protestants had not obtained a stay and had not filed a bond. Thus, these sections provided no basis for relief. The protestants also argued that parties who had paid a rate determined by the court to be unlawful were entitled to a refund from the Commission of the rates that were paid pursuant to the unlawful order. However, the rates would have been unlawful only if the Commission had finally rejected the rates on remand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a friend went to the workplace of a man who was to testify against defendant in a criminal trial the next day. At defendant's direction, the friend threatened the witness if he testified. Defendant was charged with tampering with a witness and later convicted. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the witness's testimony concerning the friend's statements was not hearsay because it was not offered to prove the truth of the statements, but to prove the fact that the statements, which constituted the crime, were made. The court ruled that, even if they were hearsay, the statements were admissible as an adoptive admission under Utah R. Evid. 63(8) because the friend spoke on defendant's behalf and at his instruction. The court found evidence supporting the fact that the friend was acting on defendant's instructions, despite defendant's denial, and that defendant was the friend's accomplice in committing the offense. The court concluded that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-8-508 (1953) was constitutional because it adequately informed an ordinary citizen who was seeking to obey the laws that it included a spoken threat attempting to induce a witness not to testify.</SPAN></P>

The statute dealt with a broad spectrum of differing agreements equally by requiring reference to each agreement individually, which was not possible without using the challenged phrase.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Publication of Higher Education Salary Data Act of 1979, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 53-48a-1, et seq. forbade the disclosure of personally identifiable salary information. The editor argued that Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 15 and U.S. Const. amend. I guaranteed members of the general public, as speakers or publishers, the right to inform others and that such right implied a right to gather information. The court maintained that the first amendment right of access to information was not absolute. The court held that case precedent and legislative history constituted an adequate showing of a compelling state interest in confidentiality of personally identifiable salary information of employees in higher education and of the fact that the interest could not be implemented by less restrictive means. The court held that even assuming that there was a constitutional right of access to information on the salaries paid to public employees, the withholding of personally identifiable salary information as prescribed in the Publication of Higher Education Salary Data Act did not violate that right.

After disputes arose between the parties, the city refused arbitration and instead filed its declaratory judgment action. The contractor defended with a successful motion to dismiss. On the city's appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that doubts should be resolved in favor of finding that the contents of a contract were subject to arbitration. Moreover, arbitration clauses were to be liberally construed unless it could be said that they were not susceptible to an interpretation covering the asserted dispute. The court found that nothing in the parties' contract was so unclear, ambiguous, or vague as to require a judge's decision rather than that of a competent arbitrator. The Arbitration Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-31-13 (1953), was presumptively constitutional, and the city did not introduce sufficient evidence to rebut that presumption. The Arbitration Act implicated no due process concerns. The city had the power to submit to arbitration any claim asserted by or against it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal of the case was based on the officers' averment that they were police officers and that plaintiff failed to file the bond provided for in U.C.A. &sect; 78-11-10, 1953. Upon the basis of plaintiff's averments and representations to the trial court that the officers were not acting as peace officers, as opposed to the affidavits of the officers asserting that they were, there was a dispute. This needed to be resolved before the lower court could have assumed it to be a fact, and peremptorily dismiss the action on the ground that the officers were acting as police officers and not as private individuals. The statute should have been so applied as to harmonize with the ideals embodied in the Utah Constitution of affording all persons equal justice under law, and of access to the courts to serve that purpose. The interests of justice required that the case be remanded for a preliminary determination as to whether the alleged wrongful actions of the officers were related to their duties as police officers, and if so, as to plaintiff's ability to furnish a bond, and of what amount.</SPAN></P>

Because the officer saw the camper contents in plain view from a place where he was lawfully entitled to be, it was not a search within the constitutional meaning of the term, and the use of the flashlight did not turn it into one. Because there was no protectible privacy interest there was no unconstitutional search, and the subsequent seizure was neither fruit of the poisonous tree nor suppressible.

The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, ruling that the absence of any reference to the value of the animal stolen in arriving at the felonious nature of the offense charged did not constitute a denial of equal protection because the difference between theft of livestock and general theft crimes rested upon a rational distinction. The court further ruled that the theft statute,&nbsp;Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-6-412 (1953) was not unconstitutional on the ground that it invested the prosecutor with discretion to charge defendant with either a misdemeanor or felony for the same conduct, that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-6-412(1)(b)(iii) (1953) was not private or special legislation, and that defendant's sentence was not excessive nor was it prejudicially imposed based on comments of the trial judge that he desired to make an example of defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 10-8-38 authorized a sewer connection fee for improved property but not for vacant lots.

The subdividers argued that the combination of these two statutes prohibited the city from collecting water fees in circumstances not authorized for sewer fees. The city argued that its fees were proper. The court rejected the subdividers' statutory argument because &sect; 17-6-22 was not mandatory and did not prohibit collection of a water connection fee from a subdivider for each lot in a subdivision at the time the subdivision was hooked up to the city water system. The court held that water connection and park improvement fees designed to raise funds to enlarge and improve sewer and water systems and recreational opportunities were legal. However, the court held that these fees were subject to a requirement of reasonableness that had to be resolved on the facts in each particular case and that required that the subdividers bear only their equitable share of the capital costs in relation to the benefits conferred.</SPAN></P>

The pretrial detainee filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus and maintained that the conditions in the county jail were unconstitutional. The trial court granted the pretrial detainee partial relief. On appeal, the court continued the procedures instituted by the trial court, ruled that a writ of habeas corpus could be used to abolish the unlawful conditions of confinement, and the issue was not moot. The court instituted procedures as follows: (1) contact visitation in appropriate cases; (2) opportunity provided for detainees to exercise; (3) better regulation of the temperature; (4) full utilization of the day room and the space in the sleeping cells during the day, if consistent with the safety of the prisoners and the security of the facility; and (5) provision for better interior lighting.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance's numerical evaluation system adequately channeled the planning commission's discretion and did not deny equal protection to the landowners. A classification allowing individuals related to or working for a farmer or dairyman to construct residences without a conditional use permit was rationally related to the legitimate goals of preserving maximum agricultural use of land while guarding against encroachment. The planning commission's denials were not illegal, discriminatory, or abuses of discretion because they properly applied the ordinance's evaluation system. The ordinance was not invalid for failure to comply with the Enabling Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 17-27-1 et seq.

(1953, 1979 Supp.) covering their land was null and void. The trial court also enjoined the town from adopting any further such declarations regarding respondents' property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the town enacted an annexation policy declaration covering respondents' adjacent land, they filed an action for a declaratory judgment that the policy declaration was contrary to law and void. The trial court granted judgment to respondents and permanently enjoined the town from interfering with respondents' development. The town appealed and the court reversed the judgment below, ruling that the town was given annexation authority without permission of the landowner by &sect; 10-2-417. That section provided that the town properly extended its corporate limits over respondents' property because it was contiguous and was within the area projected for municipal expansion under the policy declaration. Except for a right to be heard before adoption of the policy declaration, the property owners were not able to prevent the annexation if the town complied with the annexation laws. The court concluded that the policy declaration and the town's actions in conjunction with it constituted a substantial compliance with the statute, and that was all that was required. Consideration of respondents' claim of a taking was premature because the town took no steps beyond the declaration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the county had no power to enact &sect; 1-10-4 because the legislature had not specifically authorized counties to enact ordinances requiring disclosure of campaign contributions in county elections. The court held that the &sect; 1-10-4 was constitutional because: (1) Utah Code Ann. &sect; 17-5-77 (1953) conferred upon cities and counties the authority to enact all necessary measures to promote the general health, safety, morals, and welfare of their citizens; (2) the county was entitled to conclude that financial disclosure by candidates would directly serve the legitimate purpose of achieving the goal that special interests should not be able to exercise undue influence in local elections without their influence being brought to light; (3) Dillon's Rule of strict construction could not be used to restrict the power of a county under a grant by the legislature of general welfare power or prevent counties from using reasonable means to implement specific grants of authority; and (4) the ordinance did not conflict, directly or impliedly, with any state statute.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's conviction of defendant, first noting that a police officer who had observed defendant watering marijuana on his premises had not conducted a search because observations made from a lawfully accessible public vantage point do not constitute a search. The court noted that the trial court properly admitted evidence related to the plants which defendant had not been observed watering under the doctrine of constructive possession, finding that the marijuana had been under defendant's exclusive control. Further, the court rejected defendant's assertion that marijuana possession was a lesser-included offense within marijuana production, &sect; 58-37-8(1)(a)(i).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employees challenged, pursuant to &sect; 35-4-10(i) Utah Code Ann. (1953), the decision of defendant Board of Review of the Industrial Commission of Utah, which denied unemployment compensation benefits during a labor strike, followed by an industry-wide lockout. The Board affirmed the decision of an appeal referee who found that the unemployment was due to a stoppage of work which existed because of a strike involving plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first issue was plaintiffs' assertion that all idled employees were entitled to unemployment benefits because the real cause of the work stoppage resulting from both the employees' strike and the employers' lockout was the conduct of management and government, rather than labor. The court held that the facts presented, in an attempt to establish bad faith, failed to show a refusal or failure of the employer representatives to bargain with the union. The court was thus required to affirm the Board's conclusion that the employers acted in good faith and that plaintiffs were responsible for the work stoppage. The court further rejected plaintiffs' contention that employees locked out by their employers were entitled to benefits. The court held that unemployment compensation was not available to these employees because there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that the strike against some of the employers was part of a concerted plan to force acceptance of the union's demands by all of the employers involved. The court found substantial evidence supporting the conclusion that the strike was initiated for the purpose of forcing all employers to yield to the union's demands.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient filed a medical malpractice action against respondents for damages allegedly due to her addiction to medication prescribed by the doctor.

The trial court granted the respondents' motions to dismiss because the notice was deficient. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal and added a caveat that the complaints against the county and the county hospital were dismissed with prejudice and that the other complaints were dismissed without prejudice. The court found that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-14-8 merely prescribed a condition precedent to the filing of a complaint and the failure to comply did not constitute an adjudication on the merits. The court found that the patient had one year from the date of its opinion to refile her complaint against the doctor, his employer, and the drug company.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant forced the prosecutrix, who was his wife, to engage into sexual intercourse with other men. Defendant first alleged that the conviction was invalid, in that U.C.A., 1953, 76-5-404 (Utah) was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the forcing of one's wife to engage in sexual intercourse with others clearly rose to the magnitude of gravity of the acts enumerated in the statute. Defendant also could have been convicted of the crime of rape on the same facts supporting the conviction of forcible sexual abuse. If his acts constituted rape, he clearly was on notice that his conduct did not conform to the demands of the law. Defendant also complained that the State failed to show lack of consent on the part of the prosecutrix and that defendant acted with the requisite intent. Affirming, the court held that U.C.A., 1953, 76-5-406 (Utah) required such a threat as would overcome the resistance of a person of ordinary resolution. The evidence showed a process of systematic harassment and abuse. U.C.A., 1953, 76-5-404 (Utah) required only that defendant acted with the intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desires of any person, not strictly his own.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the lower court's judgment dismissing the father's complaint and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court held that Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 78-30-4(3), which limited the time in which the father could assert his parental rights where the mother had relinquished her rights to the child, denied the father his constitutional right to due process. The court found that the father was not given an opportunity to present evidence to show as a factual matter that he could not reasonably have expected his baby to be born in Utah. The court noted that if the father was successful in showing that the termination of his parental rights was contrary to basic notions of due process, and that he came forward within a reasonable time after the birth, he should be deemed to have complied with the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the city purportedly annexed the property in question, the opponents requested a permanent injunction stopping the annexation. As a result, the trial court granted a permanent injunction on the theory that the statute outlining the annexation procedure was unconstitutional.

On appeal, the court looked to the legislative history of the statute in question to support its conclusion that the annexation procedures were constitutional. Thus, the court removed the permanent injunction and remanded the cases for a determination of the remaining issues. Specifically, the court determined that the opponents presented a challenge to the statute purportedly only restricting the right to petition for the annexation, because the final decision on annexation was left to a city governing body. Accordingly, the court ultimately held that the presence of an unenforceable limitation on the right to petition did not deprive the city governing body of the power to annex.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff private club operator appealed from an order of defendant, the Utah Liquor Control Commission, that suspended its state liquor store and consumption licenses for one week.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The private club operator was licensed by the Utah Liquor Control Commission to store, serve, consume, and sell liquor. The event out of which the case arose occurred when agents of the State Division of Narcotics and Liquor Law Enforcement went to the club in question, entered without challenge or any request to show membership cards, and took seats. After a brief period, they were served with &quot;two screwdrivers.&quot; Samples of the two drinks were placed in vials by the agents, carried out with them, and were later placed in the evidence locker when the agents returned to their office. While at the club, no one asked the agents if they were members or had guest cards. The agents left the club without identifying themselves to any club personnel or disclosing that an alleged violation had occurred. Upon review, the court vacated the Commission's order and dismissed the case, holding that there was no evidence offered as to contents of the &quot;screwdriver&quot; drink, that the alcoholic content was not a fact about which either the Commission or the court could take judicial notice, and that therefore, the evidence fell short of proving a violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence indicated that defendant chief of police and defendant justice of the piece had intimidated a witness into signing a false statement concerning alleged illegal activity. The state provided an affidavit from the witness, rather than the actual witness, at the preliminary hearing in accordance with Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-15-10. On appeal the court held that the preliminary proceeding was an important part of the preliminary process, affording defendants certain procedural rights. The purpose was to determine if there was sufficient probable cause to hold defendants over for trial, to provide defendants with rights of discovery, and to preserve evidence for trial. These rights included the right to confrontation. Thus, the lower court erred in permitting the affidavit to be admitted. However, the court did not find this to be reversible error in light of the overwhelming evidence from other witnesses. On the appeal by the justice of peace, the court found that he had been immunity. Thus, his conviction could not be sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A security guard observed defendant and an accomplice attempt to leave the department store with two suits stuffed inside a raincoat. The court agreed that defendant's request for an instruction on the affirmative defense of voluntary termination was not supported by any reasonable view of the evidence. Defendant's act of dropping the suits before he was apprehended was not a voluntary act because it was an effort to avoid arrest after he had been caught. As the theft had already been completed, there could be no effective withdrawal or termination. Because escape was not an element of theft, the fact that defendant was unable to escape undetected was immaterial. The court denied defendant's contention that the instruction on the element of criminal intent allowed the jury to infer such intent, removing from the prosecution its burden of proving an essential element of the case beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court properly instructed the jury on the issue of defendant's refusal to testify after defendant's counsel had opened up the issue for rebuttal by the prosecution. Any error in the prosecution's remarks was harmless. Defendant's remaining issues were without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinances established a municipal sewer system.

The city's enforcement procedure did not represent an unconstitutional deprivation of property without due process of law because the landowners' receipt of notification of the consequences of their continuing failure to comply with terms of the ordinances afforded them adequate notice of the imminent shutoff of water.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Twelve indictments were issued against the employee and his attorneys obtained his exoneration on all indictments. The employee filed a claim for attorneys' fees pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30a-2. The trial court awarded the fees and the court affirmed. The court found that the employee adhered to the appropriate procedures as set forth in the Governmental Immunity Act, in filing his claim. The court held that the trial court had exclusive, original jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim. Although the attorneys offered to accept a nominal fee, the employee rejected that offer the court held that the amount requested were those fees necessarily incurred and that they were reasonable. Because due process protections did not extend to the state, the court held that the retroactive application of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30a-2 was not unconstitutional. Although &sect; 63-30a-2 was enacted after the employee's lobbying, the court noted that the statute recognized the officers and employees of a public entity as a distinct class and conferred benefits on all persons within the class.

The inmate's arguments as to why the issues presented in his habeas petition could not have been presented previously were meritless. There was no need for greater specification of aggravating circumstances because, so long as the record revealed the evidentiary basis for the imposition of the death penalty so as to insure that the appellate court may conduct a comprehensive review of the proceedings and insure that the penalty was not imposed arbitrarily or capriciously, the concerns of Furman were met. Moreover, recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court on which the inmate allegedly relied arose in a factual context clearly distinguishable from this case, and none of them established a significantly different test than set forth in earlier opinions. Furthermore, the issue of whether the inmate was entitled to have his offense compared with those in other Utah death penalty cases was an issue of law and not fact and, thus, could have been presented on direct appeal. Also, the standard of proof required in the sentencing phase was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The inmate did not meet his burden of showing that the issues were not substantially raised and addressed on direct appeal and why they could not have been so raised. The inmate had adequate time to assemble all pertinent data for postconviction proceedings because the hearing on the motion to dismiss was a year after the conviction was affirmed. The trial court did not have to look beyond the pleadings and the record to determine the legal sufficiency of the petition. The death penalty statutes were constitutional because the procedure provided the inmate with adequate notice at trial of the grounds upon which the sentencing authority relied, and a complete record on appeal of the considerations that motivated the death sentence.

The court concluded that the jury could find, as it did, beyond a reasonable doubt, from all the evidence which was substantial and credible, and the fair inferences from that evidence, that the killing of the victim was performed for the purpose of preventing the victim's testimony.

The committee and college president asserted that the disclosure would have a detrimental effect upon the college.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The newspaper editor sent a letter to the committee, a state administrative agency, and to the president of a state college, requesting the names and the gross salaries paid to employees of the college. The parties refused the request, and the editor filed an action to compel disclosure. The trial court ordered disclosure. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the rights of freedom of speech and of the press, and the right of the public to have and to publish the information as to the salaries paid to employees of the state college, outweighed considerations as to the right of privacy of the employees or of the institution to carry on its operations in secret. In regard to the expressed fears of the college and the committee that the exposure of the information would have an adverse effect upon their ability to operate the college, the court found that there was even a greater potential for evil in permitting public funds to be expended secretly. The court concluded that, by accepting employment at the college, its employees became not merely private citizens but public servants in whose conduct and in whose salary the public had a legitimate interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidates claimed that U.C.A., 1953, 20-3-14 , which required candidates to pay a fee for filing nomination papers in the amount of one-fourth of one percent of the total salary for the officer term, was unconstitutional. The candidates claimed that they were without funds, but one of the candidates' fees was eventually paid. The other candidate filed an affidavit of impecuniosity. The trial court did not consider either candidate impecunious, but still held that the statute was unconstitutional. The court vacated the judgment and dismissed the proceedings. The court held that it was error to hold that the statute violated the Constitution of Utah, Article I, &sect; 4, which prohibited the requirement of a property qualification for holding office. The court also held that because both of the candidates challenged the statute based on their status as impecunious officer seekers, it was not necessary to reach the question of the constitutionality of the filing fee provision; thus the candidates lacked standing to bring the action.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff alleged she was pregnant with an unwanted child, she was in her first trimester of pregnancy, and did not wish to inform her parents of her condition. The trial court found the provision constitutionally valid, and plaintiff appealed, urging that, in the first trimester, the state could not interfere at all with the fundamental interest of the pregnant woman in making an abortion decision in consultation with her physician. The court affirmed the judgment. It noted that the legislature in enacting &sect; 76-7-304(2) had strictly limited parental involvement in the minor's abortion decision. The provision did not confer on the parent an absolute and arbitrary veto. There was no basis to conclude the provision unduly burdened the constitutional right of the minor woman, in consultation with her physician, to choose to terminate her pregnancy; thus, the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners challenged the eminent domain powers of the department. They objected to the location and size of a parcel condemned for a sewage lagoon proposed to service a highway rest stop area. The court affirmed the trial court's order of immediate occupancy and its denial of the landowners' motion to dismiss. Because the statutory language authorized &quot;the construction and maintenance of roadside rest areas,&quot; and the term &quot;maintenance&quot; logically included waste disposal necessitated by services offered at the rest area, the power to construct and maintain a sewage lagoon was implied in the statutory grant of power relied upon by the department. The court rejected the landowners' objections, and held that the department's taking was a reasonable exercise of it's express condemnation powers for highway purposes and it acted in good faith. The court also ruled that allowing private parties to use the sewage lagoon facilities did not confer upon them a special and direct benefit in violation of constitutional prohibitions against the use of state and federal funds.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in allowing a police detective to relate defendant's statements because the corpus delicti had not been established prior to receiving those statements into evidence. The court found that the testimony, and the reasonable inferences that sprung from it, were sufficient for the trial court to have found by clear and convincing evidence that defendant touched the private parts of the child to arouse his sexual desire. While was manifest error for the trial court to admit the testimony of the child, over the objection of defendant, without examining her as to her competency as a witness considering her tender years, the court found that the error was harmless.

On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the notice provision was not applicable to causes of action arising prior to enactment of the Health Care Malpractice Act. The amendment that clarified that the notice provision was not retroactive was not special legislation, did not rest on an arbitrary classification, made no invidious discrimination, and applied uniformly to all within the class. The amendment merely differentiated between those classes of persons to whom the notice of intent to sue provision applied and those to whom it did not apply based on the effective date of the Malpractice Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose from the seizure of several films from a theater.

The court held that U.C.A., 1953, 76-10-1208(1), the affirmative defense statute applicable to such cases, was not unconstitutionally vague because it was sufficiently clear so that persons of common intelligence did not have to guess as its meaning. Similarly, the statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because there was a reasonable basis for treating law enforcement or educational institutions with bona fide pursuits and intentions differently than profit-making commercial ventures with unlawful pursuits and intentions. The court further held that there was substantial evidence to support the conviction because the jury reasonably could have found that defendant had knowledge of the content of the films and that he was guilty of the crime charged. There was no merit in defendant's contention that he was refused a prompt adversary hearing because he failed to comply with the procedures set forth in U.C.A., 1953, 76-10-1212(3).

On review, however, the court noted that for offenses that occurred after May 8, 1979, defendant's argument was moot because the 1979 amendment to the statute had made it gender neutral. Defendant, however, was convicted for offenses that occurred in 1978 and was prosecuted under the pre-amendment version of the statute. The court refused to discuss the constitutional issue further because it concluded that defendant had failed to present the issue to the district court for a determination. The court saw no indication in the record of a motion or any objection that defendant had filed below that would have remotely preserved the issue for the court. In addition, the court explained that the rule providing that a defendant had no right to raise an issue for the first time on appeal applied when a challenged statute was not so plainly unconstitutional that a trial court's failure to raise the issue sua sponte constituted clear error.</SPAN></P>

The informant purchased the bags with marked money given to him by the police, and then returned to defendant's home. At defendant's request, the informant left a small quantity of marijuana for setting up the buy. The informant then proceeded to the police station, where the substance purchased was analyzed and tagged as evidence. The trial court, sitting without a jury, found defendant guilty. The court rejected defendant's contention that the statute under which he was convicted, U.C.A., 1953, 58-37-8(1)(a)(iv) (Utah), was unconstitutionally vague and overly broad. The language of the statute could not confuse citizens of average intelligence as to the conduct forbidden by the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his conviction, the inmate filed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. In appealing its dismissal, he also argued that he should not have appeared at his criminal trial in prison garb. Affirming, the court concluded that none of his contentions rose to the standard for habeas corpus relief. In part, under that standard, the writ was proper when the requirements of the law were so ignored or distorted that the party was substantially, effectively denied due process or where some circumstances existed making it wholly unconscionable not to re-examine his conviction. The court also noted that while the testimony of a State witness, not disclosed to a defendant, in rebuttal to his alibi evidence could be excluded under &sect; 77-22-17 U.C.A. (1953), as amended (Utah), a trial court could waive the notice requirement for good cause and that according to the district court below, the criminal trial court had found such good cause and had waived the notice requirement. Nothing in the record showed that the inmate had challenged that finding. The court also saw no unconstitutional compulsion because he had failed to object at his criminal trial to appearing in court in prison garb.</SPAN></P>

The landowner brought a declaratory judgment action to test the constitutionality of the annexation. The city filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and the trial court granted the motion and upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 10-2-401. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the city was not required to give any notice at all with respect to the annexation and that there was no violation of the Due Process Clause of Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The court further held that the legislature was within its right to provide a mechanism for annexation that did not require an election by those affected.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city appealed a decision of a district court (Utah) that a municipal business license revenue tax levied by the city upon plaintiff corporation was unlawful and unconstitutional. The decision also dismissed a petition submitted by plaintiffs, trustee and holder, as owners of the corporation's property, for disconnection of the property from the city and the owners cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city planned to impose a license fee tax on amusements and it was clear that the tax was intended for, and tailored to, the corporation alone. The proposed tax had no regulatory goals and was purely revenue-producing. At issue was whether or not the licensing ordinance represented such an improper classification that its operation became discriminatory, arbitrary, and an abuse of taxing power. The court affirmed. It found that the effective result of the ordinance was the imposition upon a single enterprise of a tax, the revenues of which could, at the discretion of the city, be devoted to any municipal corporate purpose. The court found that the imposition of a potentially crippling tax on a single business for the benefit of the community as a whole, coupled with vague promises of improved services which the business had not been guaranteed, presented a case of abuse of taxing power. As to the cross-appeal, the owners asserted that &quot;justice and equity&quot; mandated the disconnection of the corporation from the city. The court, however, found adequate evidence in the record to support the findings of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The Fund claimed that it was entitled to be reimbursed for all compensation benefits paid or payable to dependents of the deceased before the nondependent heirs were entitled to participate in the wrongful death recovery. The court affirmed. It found that the Fund's right of recovery was limited to the respective rights of those heirs in whose shoes it stood, by virtue of having paid them compensation. Such right, however, did not extend to the shares of the nondependent heirs. The court held that the Legislature had not provided, and did not intend to provide, for the divestment of the right of heirs to damages under the Wrongful Death Statute,&nbsp;&sect;78-11-7, U.C.A.

After the trial court granted the city summary judgment, the phone company sought review, and the court reversed. Despite the earlier litigation, the court held the phone company had not been estopped from bringing the action because: 1) the phone company was challenging tax obligations accrued subsequent to those at issue in the original action; and 2) subsequent decisions had made telephone competition permissible, thereby making it impermissible to treat telephone utility companies as a distinct class. Moreover, after finding the taxing scheme constitutional on its face, the court held a genuine issue of fact existed as to whether or not the ordinance, which allegedly taxed the phone company's competitors at a different rate, violated the equal protection clause in its application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the proceeding, the taxpayer argued that the warrant of judgment was invalid because the tax rate was unconstitutionally discriminatory. He was taxed at the individual rate, not the lower rates applied to heads of households and certain married persons. On review, the court determined that it was precluded from ruling on the discrimination issue because &sect; 59-14A-76(a), U.C.A. (Utah) (repealed 1977), specifically provided that the Commission's orders were reviewable only on direct appeal to the court; the questions were not properly raised in a supplemental proceeding. The court explained that there were carefully defined procedures for seeking review of the legality of the tax laws and of deficiency orders and that in a direct appeal, they were reviewable solely on the record that was before the Commission. The court also pointed out that the Commission had no power to determine the constitutionality of statutes, that the taxpayer could have filed an independent action under &sect; 59-11-10, U.C.A. (Utah), or &sect; 59-11-11, U.C.A. (Utah), and that strong evidence would have been needed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality that was granted to any statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The right to drive was a privilege and could not be taken away without procedural due process. However, the court on appeal did not agree that revocation proceedings were necessarily criminal or quasi-criminal in nature. Also, the court on appeal failed to fine that the license revocation procedure in Utah was enacted to &quot;redress a public wrong.&quot; A person refusing a chemical test was not required to post bond for his appearance, nor was he under any legal duty to appear at the administrative hearing in which the determination could be made to revoke the operator's license. He could not be fined or imprisoned either for his refusal to submit to a test or for his failure to appear at the hearing. Because the proceeding was not criminal in nature, the driver was not entitled to the application of the rule that the corpus delicti of the crime had to be established by evidence independent of the accused's confession. The court on appeal also found that the officer that stopped the driver had reasonable grounds for justifying his actions. The officer testified he smelled a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage about the driver's person, and noticed the driver &quot;weave&quot; as he walked.</SPAN></P>

The employer refused the agent admission. The district court dismissed the State's suit for an order for immediate entry of the employer's premises on the ground that &sect; 35-9-8(1), U.C.A. 1953, was unconstitutional. In affirming the dismissal, the court held that &sect; 35-9-8(1) authorized the State's agents to enter an employer's workplace, upon presenting appropriate credentials, and inspect and investigate the premises and question any employer or employee. The rule that warrantless searches were generally unreasonable applied to commercial premises as well as homes. Moreover, the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches protected against warrantless intrusions during civil and criminal investigations. For the purpose of an administrative search for OSHA violations, probable cause justifying the issuance of a warrant had to be based on specific evidence of an existing violation and a showing that reasonable legislative standards for conducting an inspection were satisfied.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial court's judgment and held that the trial court abused its discretion in requiring the payment of attorney's fees as a condition to setting aside the default judgment. The notice to quit failed to comply with Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-36-3 because it did not state that the tenant had the option of paying the delinquent rent. Thus, because &sect; 78-36-3 was not complied with, the tenant was not in unlawful detainer and the landlord was not entitled to maintain the unlawful detainer action against her.

The court reversed the district court's decision because no notice of the judgment was ever sent to the litigant and due process required that the notice of judgment be given to the litigant. The court held that despite the fact the &sect; 78-6-10 does not provide that the notice must be given a defendant in a small claims court, Utah R. Civ. P. 73(h) applied to procedure in the small claims court and the time for appeal under Rule 73(h) commenced from the time of the notice of judgment. No evidence was offered that notice had been sent to the litigant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's order denying the litigant's writ of mandamus and remanded the cause of action to the district court for the purposes of hearing the litigant's appeal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sold a used car to certain victims on which the odometer had been turned back. On appeal, defendant argued that the State failed to prove an essential element of the offense, to wit, that the victims were deprived of any property; and that that the State failed to prove that any property of which the victims was deprived had a value in excess of $ 1,000. The court affirmed and held the State proved each and every essential element of the offense. The evidence established that defendant brought about the transfer of the victims' money to himself by means of a deception with the conscious objective of withholding the money permanently. The court held that the State established that the victims were deprived of $ 2,800, though they received some value therefor, which amount was well above the statutory amount establishing a second degree felony, under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-6-412 (1953, as amended).</SPAN></P>

The district court declared 20-1-7.7(6)(2) unconstitutional. On review, the court reversed in part. The constitutional provision was amended to include that the selection of judges were to be based solely upon their fitness for office. The legislature enacted steps, which created judicial nominating commissions to facilitate the non-partisan selection of judges based on their fitness for office. The court held that 20-1-7.7(6)(2) was constitutional, as being part of a statutory scheme logically providing for a method of electing judges under the express authority of the Constitution. The court held that the statute meant that, upon the death, resignation, or disqualification of a candidate, leaving only one candidate eligible, that candidate was to be issued a certificate of election and sworn in as the judge.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that &sect; 76-5-401 was unconstitutional as it did not equally criminalize conduct of girls. The court found no violation of equal protection of the law; it found a valid basis or bases for the separate classification of girls. Without citing any studies or other authority, the court wrote that female persons above 18 were not drawn to male persons under 16, but male persons above 18 were much more aggressive sexually and tended to take advantage of immature girls. The court found that there was a problem with teenage pregnancy and wrote that boys could not become pregnant. The legislature could permissibly make laws regarding distinct classes of people where there was a valid basis for each distinction. The court rejected defendant's separate argument that the State did not prove its case by not showing that he was not married to the girl. The court found that there was circumstantial evidence that he was not married to her, which included his not telling the arresting officer that he was married.</SPAN></P>

The corporation applied for an annulment of the suspension, the same was denied. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that it was proper to interfere with the business of exhibiting motion pictures because the threat of public exposure to obscene movies could be found to endanger public safety; thus the city properly exercised its police power in making and enforcing the ordinance. Additionally, the court held that the means of suspending the license was not per se unreasonably necessary, and the court held that it was within the city's discretion to determine the selection of remedy to deal with the problem.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bookstore was formerly licensed by the city to do business. The license was revoked following the bookstore's 30 criminal convictions for distributing pornographic materials offensive to public decency.

The trial court found that any enjoinder of the bookstore's operation would constitute an unconstitutional &quot;prior restraint&quot; on the right of free speech. On appeal, the court held that the city and the county were entitled to an injunction against the bookstore because it was operating a business in the city without a license. The city had properly revoked the license under Title 7, Chapter 28, Ogden City, Oregon Ordinances. The court ruled that once a license had been properly revoked and a business nevertheless continued to operate, the usual remedy was a misdemeanor prosecution. The court rejected the bookstore's argument that it could operate without a license under the doctrine of &quot;prior restraint.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Defendant characterized its appeal as an attempt to persuade the court to overrule Piepenburg, and admitted that no new arguments were available. Defendant's sole contention was that the challenged Ordinance attempted to criminalize some conduct which was protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution. The court confirmed its holding in Piepenburg that the Ordinance was not invalidated by overbreadth; that the exemption afforded by the Ordinance was based on reasonable and understandable classification, and finally, that the Ordinance did not violate equal protection guarantees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the wife and daughter of a deceased prisoner, sought review of an order of a Utah district court, which dismissed a complaint filed against defendants, the State of Utah, the Board of Corrections, and various individuals, for wrongful death. The district court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the claims were barred by the Utah Governmental Immunity Act, &sect; 63-30-1 et seq., Utah Code Annotated, 1953, as amended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner died following surgery at the Utah State Prison's hospital. Plaintiffs' first contention was that the district court erred in dismissing their complaint. They argued that the Act did not bar their claims, as (1) the operation of a hospital facility at the State prison was a proprietary and not a governmental function; and (2) plaintiffs' claims did not &quot;arise out of&quot; the prisoner's incarceration within the meaning of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-10(10) (1953). The court on appeal found that the operation of a hospital at the prison facility had to be regarded as a governmental function. The State had a responsibility to provide medical care for its prisoners, and in fulfillment of that duty it could operate a hospital at the prison facilities. No pecuniary benefit flowed from such an activity; neither did the hospital compete for patients with other hospitals. Also, the operation of a state prison was in the public interest. However, the court found that the district court erred in dismissing the complaint against the individual defendants because the Act applied only to governmental entities and did not affect the personal liability of individuals for their own torts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order dismissing the complaint was affirmed as to the State of Utah and the Board of Corrections and was reversed as to the individual defendants.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants contended that U.C.A., 1953, 76-10-1204 (Utah) was unconstitutional. The court upheld its constitutionality. Defendants next argued that closing remarks made by defense counsel in a first trial substantially admitted guilt thereby depriving defendants of effective assistance. Counsel conceded that the material depicted sexual conduct and lacked artistic value, focusing the jury's attention on whether the material was appealing to the prurient interest. The court held that counsel had substantial latitude in selecting trial strategy. Defendants next argued that the trial courts erred in failing to define the geographical limitation of &quot;community standards.&quot; Having failed to make a written request for instructions, defendants could not appeal the issue. The court next found no abuse of the trial court's discretion in refusing to grant a change of venue in the second trial. The motion was denied on the basis of timeliness. Finally, defendants argued that the exclusion from the jury of individuals ages 18 to 21 violated their Sixth Amendment rights. The group was identifiable. However, defendants failed to show that the attitudes of this group were inadequately represented.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employer challenged a judgment from the District Court (Utah), which adjudged plaintiff to be in contempt of court for violating the anti-retaliatory and anti-discriminatory provisions of a previous judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hearing examiner of the Industrial Commission (commission) found that employer had discriminated against defendant employee based on her gender. Employer appealed and the district court affirmed the judgment and issued an order prohibiting employer from taking any retaliatory actions against employee. Thereafter, employee was fired and employer was found to be in contempt of court for violation of the judgment's anti-retaliatory provisions. Employer appealed the judgment arguing, among other things, that it was error to refuse a jury trial in district court. The state supreme court held that the court, and not a jury, was to be the fact finder on appeals in antidiscrimination cases. Further, since employer's action towards employee constituted contempt the court properly ordered reinstatement of employee or payment of wages in lieu thereof. However, the district court had exceeded its authority when it elected to levy a fine as the penalty for employer's contempt because the fine exceeded the statutory limit and it levied a penalty prospectively for acts that had not taken place. Accordingly, judgment was reversed and remanded for a corrected calculation of the levied fine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court affirmed in part and reversed in part the judgment of the district court. It held that the court properly ordered reinstatement of employee or payment of wages in lieu thereof. However, the statutory limit for the contempt fine was exceeded and therefore reversal and remand was ordered for a correct determination as to the levied fine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband was granted a divorce and ordered to pay alimony and child support. The wife later sought modification to increase alimony and support payments. The district court increased the alimony and support payments to the son but terminated support payments for the daughter, who had turned 18. Both parties were denied attorneys' fees. The wife's motion to amend and the husband's motion for rehearing were denied. The court found no error or abuse of discretion except in termination of the daughter's support, which it reversed and remanded for the district court to determine if the support should be continued, as it could be continued until she turned 21. The husband's income fluctuated from year to year. The district court's consideration of his annual tax returns, and of both his individual and corporate incomes, was not improper. The husband's support obligation did not terminate under the law when she turned 18.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation requested a rehearing of a matter based solely upon the ground that a justice, a retired member of the Supreme Court of Utah, had participated. On review, the court found that there was no merit to the request and affirmed the judgment. The court found that the justice was mentally and physically able to sit and was not engaged in the practice of law. He, therefore, was qualified to sit on the case. Pursuant to Chapter 222, Laws of Utah, 1967, codified as U.C.A., 1953, 49-7-5.7, any judge who had retired and was physically and mentally able to perform the duties of the office and who was not engaged in the practice of law was entitled after retirement to serve as a justice of the Supreme Court upon invitation of the chief justice. The justice was invited to sit on the case. His vote in the matter was not needed as the decision was a per curiam opinion with two of the five justices concurring in the result. The corporation only complained about the membership of the Court after the decision was rendered partially against it.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the commission's decision. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the ruling that the statutory formula did not represent the extent of the taxpayer's business activity in the state. The court also found that the method of allocation and apportionment employed was reasonable and equitable. The court determined that the taxpayer's income from solicitation in other states was attributable to its business activity in the state and that the apportionment provisions of UDITPA did not fairly represent the taxpayer's local business activity. The court held that the commission employed a proper method to reach an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer's income.

A person telephoned the company and stated that he had the checks in his possession. He threatened to destroy the checks unless a ransom was paid. A package of checks was left in the office of an attorney who had previously represented defendant. The attorney refused defendant's request to contact the company and called the police instead. Affirming, the court held that U.C.A. 1953, as amended, 76-8-1001 was constitutional. The habitual criminal statute did not create a new crime; it merely enhanced the punishment for the conviction of a crime committed when a defendant had previously committed at least two other felonies and been sent to prison for the offenses. In addition, the prosecutor had discretion as to whether or not to charge a violation of any criminal statute. Some selectivity was permitted, as long as it was not discriminatory based on improper classifications, such as race or sex. Finally, there was no breach of client confidentiality on the part of the attorney because there was no protected confidential relationship if a lawyer and his client engaged in a criminal conspiracy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged provisions were &sect; 15-18-3(d) and (e) and &sect; 15-18-6(3), (4), (5) and (10) of Chapter 18, Title 15 of the Revised Ordinances of Salt Lake County, 1966. The code provisions imposed certain license fees and operating restrictions on massage parlors and individual masseurs. The trial court upheld all but &sect; 15-18-3(d). Plaintiffs appealed and the court reversed. Section 15-18-3(e) imposed a $ 5,000 fee for any massage parlor that employed any masseur who worked at any massage parlor whose license had been revoked in the past 12 months. The court held that this provision violated Utah Constitution, Article I, Sec. 18 and U.S. Constitution, Article I, Sec. 10, by imposing a penalty without a conviction for any crime. It effectively punished a licensee based on the conduct of a former employer, or an employee of a former employer. Section 15-18-6(3), (4), (5) and (10) were unconstitutional because they established categories that distinguished between an individual masseur and two or more masseurs working together when there was no rational basis for doing so.</SPAN></P>

That judgment declared that the one-percent tax imposed on the State Insurance Fund under U.C.A., 1953, &sect; 31-14-4(1)(b), was unconstitutional. Respondent Department of Finance administrated the State Insurance Fund and refused to pay the tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Per U.C.A., 1953, &sect; 31-14-4(1)(B), the State Insurance Fund was required to pay a tax of 1 percent of the total premiums it received. That tax was in addition to another tax imposed under U.C.A., 1953, &sect; 31-14-4(3), on every company that provided workers' compensation insurance in Utah. The court ruled that the tax under U.C.A., 1953, &sect; 31-14-4(1)(B), was unconstitutional as a violation of the equal protection of the law. Such equal protection was provided as a right by the Utah Constitution, article I, &sect; 2 and the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Part of the court's rationale was that the Fund was the same as any other workers' compensation insurer. Significant were, inter alia, that the Fund's assets existed just to cover the same type of obligations insured by private carriers, and the Fund had the same administrative costs as private carriers, and it had not been given any immunities that private insurers did not have. That the Fund was administered by a State agency was not a rational basis to tax it solely. The tax also violated the Utah Constitution, article VI, &sect; 26, which did not allow enactment of a special law where a general law could apply.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was completely owned by the developer of the community. The developer realized that during the early years of development, the revenue from the services furnished was to have been insufficient to pay the costs of operation, and it was necessary to subsidize the facilities. The central issue before the Commission was how should the utility rate base have been calculated. An investigation revealed the reason that the utility was operating at a loss was because the system was overbuilt. The Commission found a new business venture could not have been expected to return a profit in its initial stages, and that plaintiff's owner should not have been permitted to pass a portion of its business risk onto plaintiff; but should bear the loss as the developer. The court concluded that there was evidence to sustain defendant's findings. Further, defendant did not exceed its authority in exercising jurisdiction over plaintiff's owner. The court held that in making a determination of costs for rate purposes, the Commission could look through the corporate form of affiliated corporations and probe for economic realities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were close friends and had decided to go to Las Vegas to celebrate birthdays. On the way home, the driver, due to some unknown cause, permitted the car to leave the road and turn over, injuring the passengers. The court rejected the claim that the passengers were paying passengers rather than guest-passengers because the parties were social friends engaged in an outing for fun. The court also rejected the claim that the guest statute was unconstitutional. It did not violate the equal protection clause. The court stated that the comparative negligence law did not repeal the guest statute, Utah Code Annotated, 1953, &sect;&sect; 41-9-1, 41-9-2, by implication, and the &quot;no-fault&quot; statute did not make a host liable for simple negligence. While the guest statute prevented a recovery against a host, it made no exception for a recovery under the contract between a host and an insurance carrier, which protected those who rode with the permission of the insured host.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff game cock fighter appealed a decision of the court of appeals (Utah) in favor of defendant Board of County Commissioners (board), which held that the offense of cruelty to animals under Salt Lake County, Utah, Rev. Ordinances title 16, ch. 3, &sect; 28 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to the game cock fighter's conviction for cruelty to animals, she sought a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was unconstitutional on the grounds: (1) that it was vague and uncertain in that innocent conduct of merely being a spectator could be included within its language; and (2) that presence at such a cock fight was proscribed, without requiring a culpable mental state. The trial court rejected her contentions and she appealed. On review the court held that the board, in the exercise of its police power, had both the prerogative and the responsibility of enacting laws which would promote and conserve the good order, safety, health, morals and general welfare of society. The courts should defer to the legislative prerogative and should presume such enactments were valid and should not strike down legislation unless it clearly and persuasively appeared that the act was in conflict with a constitutional provision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant protestor sought review of the order of the trial court (Utah), which granted respondent church's motion for a temporary restraining order and dismissed the protestor's counterclaim for damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The church was granted a temporary restraining order against the protestor to enjoin him from entering the church or disrupting a church event. The protestor filed a counterclaim that was dismissed for failure to state a claim. On appeal, the court affirmed finding that the injunction was proper because the protestor had previously disrupted church events and he had threatened to do so again. The court found that the disruptions threatened by the protestor would cause immediate and irreparable damage and there was no other remedy available to the church. The court found that it was not necessary for the church to provide a security for the injunction because there was no risk of monetary loss to the protestor. The court ruled that dismissal of the protestor's counterclaim for damages for the wrongful issuance of a temporary restraining order was proper because the circumstances did not give rise to a cause of action for malicious prosecution as required.</SPAN></P>
