</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers sought review of decisions by the circuit court (Kentucky), which upheld orders issued by appellee, Kentucky Board of Tax Appeals, which assessed additional income taxes against the taxpayers. The taxpayers attacked the general statutory scheme under which the taxes were imposed, alleging unconstitutionality because the taxpayers were foreign corporations and claimed that they were being unfairly taxed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The basic question presented was whether the dividend income from the taxpayers, wholly owned corporations, must have been included in the taxpayers' taxable net income, for the purpose of apportioning income taxes payable to the State of Kentucky, under the provisions of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 141 in effect during the tax years involved. The taxpayers argued that it was unconstitutional for the state to tax income from property or activities that had no relationship to the doing of business in Kentucky. The only income the taxpayers contended should not have been included for apportionment purposes was the separately identifiable dividend income from wholly owned corporate subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions. The court reversed the decisions of the circuit court, finding that the determining factor was not whether the dividend income may have been characterized as &quot;business&quot; or &quot;nonbusiness,&quot; but whether it arose from a source integrated with business carried on in Kentucky. The court found that if properly includable as &quot;gross income,&quot; it should have been deductible (before the apportionment formula was applied) as nontaxable dividend income.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgments by the circuit court in the taxpayers' challenge to the Board's orders and the orders of the Board were set aside in both cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant rented the first floor of a two-story building in connection with a retail jewelry business. On the date in question, he left the store about 5:00 p.m., and a fire was discovered in the building approximately 30 minutes later. At the time of the fire, defendant was in debt, his business was not thriving, and he had obtained a large insurance policy on his merchandise two months earlier. Defendant was then indicted and charged with maliciously burning the store building. During defendant's trial, the trial court failed to allow a fireman to testify that he did not smell &quot;accelerant&quot; fumes in the building, although his fellow firemen testified to such smell. Defendant was later convicted of the crime and sentenced to four years in prison. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion, pursuant to Ky. R. Civ. P. 43.09, in refusing to allow the fireman to testify because, although his testimony had a slight tendency to contradict the negative testimony of his fellow firemen, his testimony was not so vital or convincing as to require the trial court to allow it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation brought an action that sought to prohibit appellees from having a sign removed as being in violation of the Billboard Act and implementing departmental regulations. The trial court ordered the removal of the sign, and the corporation sought review. On appeal, the corporation contended that the State had no authority to regulate a billboard sign in a city on property that had been zoned as industrial or commercial. The corporation also contended that the State was not entitled to adopt regulations more prohibitive than the federal controls, that the regulations adopted were too vague and exceed the authority granted by statute, and that the sign reasonably complied with state regulations. The court held that the State had authority under its police power to regulate outdoor advertising along interstate highways within the corporate limits of the municipality that it had created. The court held that the Act delegated to appellees, as agents of the State, a right of control in the exercise of the State's police power and that this right was superior to the right of the city to zone. The court ruled that the regulations were neither vague nor unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners sought review of a judgment entered by the trial court (Kentucky) in favor of appellee sewer construction district awarding the landowners one dollar each for the easements created over the landowners' property for the purpose of building a sewer project.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sewer construction district built a new sewer over the landowners' property. The landowners paid an assessment for the sewer and then were paid only one dollar each for the easement over their property. This was due to the deduction taken due to the increased value of the property because of the new sewer. On appeal, the court reversed. These cases being sewer district condemnation proceedings in which the entire cost of the whole project was paid by the landowners along the sewer line, it was unfair, unjust, and unconstitutional to charge them with the benefits or enhancement of their property by reason of the construction of the sewer system. To do so amounted to requiring them to pay for the system through the statutory plan of assessment and then pay a second time by way of charging them for the enhancement of their property, an element in the after value. Although generally, any enhancement in value growing out of the improvement was considered in fixing the &quot;after&quot; value, that only applied where the condemnor was supplying the enhancement. Such was not the case here where the entire cost of the improvement was paid by the landowners through special assessments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the legislation that created the additional judgeship was invalid as a violation of Ky. Const. &sect; 138. That section authorized an additional judge in counties with a population of 75,000 or more. The court noted that considering the industrial character of the county, the substantial increase in court business and other factors, from the standpoint of proper judicial administration, an additional judge was needed. At first blush, Ky. Stat. &sect; 138 seemed to require the specified population. The court found, however, that the various sections that related to the creation and alteration of judicial districts had to be read together. Ky. Const. &sect; 138 was construed to mean that, regardless of other considerations such as territory, business, or necessity, the legislature could have created a single county judicial district if the stated population condition existed. That did not, however, rule out the right of the legislature to adopt the criteria set forth in Ky. Stat. &sect;&sect; 128, 132 in lieu of the population yardstick. The legislature could have considered other pertinent and practical factors in determining the necessity for the creation of another judgeship.</SPAN></P>

The application was made pursuant to the requirement of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 199.470(6). The Commissioner denied their application and the couple filed an appeal from the Commissioner's ruling. The trial court held unconstitutional certain sections of the applicable statutes, and ordered that the couple be permitted to file their petition for adoption, subject to final decision of the court. The court reversed the judgment, finding the statutes were not unconstitutional based on a premise that the legislature had authority to regulate a statutory right to adopt. Further, since the trial court deemed the statute unconstitutional, there was no adjudication below as to whether the refusal of approval was arbitrary. The court held that since the child had been with the couple during the interim changes in conditions, a demonstration of fitness compelled a different administrative finding. Fundamentally the best interests of the child had to fashion the ultimate determination of whether the Commissioner should grant or deny approval for adoption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were arrested while preparing to begin a church service in the back yard of their farm. They had solicited persons to become members of their church, which they felt they had been called to establish, but no one had joined. The yard was visible from the road. A sign warning people of the nudist church had been posted on the road to the farm. Defendants did not have a license to operate a nudist society nor was the premises surrounded by a 20-foot high wall as was required by Ky. Rev. Stat. ch. 232. On appeal, the court held that Chapter 232 was unconstitutional on the grounds that the regulatory provisions therein were so unreasonable as to be prohibitive. Though it was within the legislature's police powers to regulate nudist societies, its regulations in that regard had to be reasonable. The requirement in Chapter 232 that a person seeking to own or operate a nudist society had to pay a $ 1,000 license tax each year and build a 20-foot brick, stone, or cement wall around the entire premises effectively precluded the existence of a nudist society altogether.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action to obtain a release from prison, appellant inmate challenged a judgment for appellee warden from the Calloway Circuit Court (Kentucky). The inmate asserted that the circuit court erred in dismissing his petition because, by acquiescing in his removal by authorities of a demanding state, the circuit court had waived jurisdiction to revoke his probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the inmate was imprisoned for the theft of an automobile, he sought to compel the warden to release him on the theory that the order revoking his probation was illegal due to a waiver of jurisdiction. The circuit court dismissed the petition, and the inmate appealed. The court affirmed, explaining that, after the inmate had been granted probation and while he was still in custody, officers from Tennessee appeared with a warrant for his arrest. The inmate voluntarily waived extradition and was returned to Tennessee, where he served a prison term. After his release, he was again arrested in Kentucky for another car theft, and the circuit court revoked his probation. The court held that the bare act of probation could not be deemed a waiver of jurisdiction. The inmate's probation had contained all of the usual conditions and was for a term of five years. There was no act or conduct evincing the relinquishment of any right by a Kentucky official, and Kentucky had retained the supervision of the inmate during the probationary period.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action to compel a tax levy, appellants, the Laurel County Fiscal Court (Kentucky) and its members, challenged a judgment for appellees, as individuals and trustees of the Laurel County Public Library District, from a trial court (Kentucky). Appellants asserted that the trial court erred in finding that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 173.720 had not imposed an excessive tax rate in violation of the Kentucky Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellees organized a library district for the County, they sought to compel appellees to levy a tax of 10 cents on each $ 100 worth of property assessed for local taxation, under &sect; 173.720. The trial court rejected appellants' contention that &sect; 173.720 was unconstitutional, and it ordered them to levy the tax. Appellants sought review, and the court affirmed, explaining that Ky. Const. &sect; 157 provided that the maximum allowable tax rate for municipalities for other than school purposes was 50 cents on $ 100. The County was levying the maximum tax under &sect; 157. Appellants insisted that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 173.720 was unconstitutional because it increased the county tax to an amount in excess of the maximum allowable. However, Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 173.715 recognized a library district's power to tax, and under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 173.720, the County merely collected the tax as agent of the library district. Thus, the library tax was not a part of the County tax within the prohibition of Ky. Const. &sect; 157 but was a tax levied by a new taxing district created under statutory authority. Accordingly, Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 173.270 did not contravene the constitutional limit on the maximum tax.</SPAN></P>

The court held that all power was inherent in the people. Because the people were the source of all governmental power, the constitution could not limit their power. The people could not be divested of the power to reform their government by constitutional provisions that detailed how to revise and amend the constitution. The people had a right to make and alter their constitution by any explicit and authentic act of the whole people.

He sought to avoid serving four years at hard labor in the state reformatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant and the mother of his children were divorced, he was ordered to pay $ 25 per week in child support. Three months later, defendant and his ex-wife entered into an agreement that reduced the weekly payments to $ 15. The indictment against defendant charged that he abandoned the children by failing to comply with the order to pay child support. Though the indictment did not make reference to the statute under which defendant was charged in the accusatory part of the indictment, it was sufficient to inform him of the nature of the crime with which he was charged. The statute under which he was charged required proof that his children were in indigent or destitute circumstances before he could be convicted. The evidence showed that the mother's present husband had a job and that the children were being well cared for from material and educational standpoints. Thus, the very foundation on which the constitutionality of the statute was based was not proved. The conviction failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board awarded the employee workmen's compensation. The employee's attorney requested approval of his fee and to commute sufficient payments in a lump sum from the award to pay his fee. The board awarded the attorney a fee, and commuted that amount from the final payments of the employee's award. The employer commuted the attorney's fee, plus a 5 percent discount under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.150. When the employer ceased making payments to the employee, he brought this action to recover the balance owed. The trial court decided the case against him. The employee challenged the decision to allow the employer to take the discount, contending that since &sect; 342.320(2) did not specifically authorize a discount of the amount to be commuted, no discount was allowed. He also argued the provisions of &sect; 342.150 allowing a discount for the commuting of a lump sum were not applicable to an attorney's fee. The court found the employee's financial obligation to his attorney was paid as a lump sum in accordance with &sect; 342.320. Moreover, because &sect; 342.150 provided for the discount on lump sum awards, the decision to allow the discount on the employee's attorney fees was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department store had asked for injunctive relief because the city had been enforcing the Sunday closing law against it but not against grocery stores, pharmacies, and other businesses that the city considered &quot;works of necessity.&quot; The city argued that injunctive relief was not available against the Sunday closing law. The court distinguished the case that established that principle, noting that the injunction was against discrimination in enforcement of the statute, not enforcement of the statute itself. The court also rejected the city's argument that the department store had unclean hands, noting that such an argument would bar relief for any person against which criminal laws were arbitrarily and discriminatorily enforced. While acknowledging that the constitution did not require perfect equality in the enforcement of statutes, the court held the discrimination before it to be obvious and flagrant. The department store employees were the only persons the city had found guilty of violating the Sunday closing law in 25 years. Although food and drugs were necessities, Sunday access to grocery stores and pharmacies was no more necessary than access to a department store.</SPAN></P>

The court also rejected his contention that the charge was barred by a conviction in Ohio for the same offense, finding that there was no mention in the Ohio complaint that the victim was the same person. Further, defendant raised the contention for the first time on appeal.

The court held: (1) the fact that Kentucky law required the company to give reasonable and timely warning of the approach of its train to a public crossing did not mean that it had to employ the devices that the Department installed, nor did it mean that the Department could not provide additional safeguards at public crossings; (2) increased traffic safety was a project for which the Department could spend public money, and incidental benefits to the company did not constitute a prohibited loan of credit; (3) promotion of traffic safety was a highway purpose within Ky. Const. &sect; 230; (4) where the safety devices were part of the public highway system, their maintenance did not create an obligation against future public revenues in violation of Ky.

The court affirmed the trial court and held that the city ordinance requiring that the property owner pay the water charges on his tenant properties was a valid exercise of the city's authority. Although the tenants were the ultimate consumers, the property owner benefited from the service of water to his tenant properties. The city ordinance requiring the property owner to pay for water to his tenant properties was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee landowners brought suit against appellants, a city's mayor and councilmen, in which the landowners claimed that an ordinance prohibiting exploration for oil or gas within the city's corporate limits was unconstitutional. A Kentucky trial court ruled in favor of the landowners and enjoined appellants from enforcing the ordinance. Appellants challenged the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On August 6, 1957, the city council adopted the ordinance prohibiting exploration for oil or gas within the city's corporate limits. On September 3, 1963, the city council passed a general zoning ordinance. Oil was discovered near the city limits in 1965, after which the landowners instituted their suit to have the 1957ordinance declared void. The court stated that the primary question to be resolved on appeal was whether, assuming the 1957 ordinance to be invalid, the general zoning ordinance would prohibit drilling for oil and gas in residential areas where no commercial operations were permitted. Reversing, the court rejected the landowners' argument that under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 353.500, the city lacked the power to prohibit the business of drilling for oil and gas within its limits. Rather, the court stated, the statement of policy in that statute was to be interpreted in conjunction with and subordinate to the basic powers of municipalities. The court concluded that the city's general zoning ordinance was a valid ordinance that controlled to the extent that it classified land uses permitted under its terms.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1946, the great-nephew was adopted in New York. At that time adopted children had the right to inherit from their blood relatives under Kentucky law. However, in 1956, Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 199.520(2) was enacted, and it provided that adopted children had no legal relationship to their birth parents in respect to personal or property rights. The great-uncle died intestate in 1959 and owned land in Kentucky. The trial court held that the great-nephew had no right to inherit the land from great-uncle by blood, and the court affirmed. The court held that the extraterritorial effect of a foreign adoption decree was limited by the principle that the descent of real property was to be governed by the law of the situs of the property. Thus, what New York law was pertaining to the great-nephew's rights was not relevant. Also, the prospect of an inheritance was an expectancy; thus, the legislature could modify the laws of descent and take away previously existing inheritance rights so long as the change occurred before the death of the person from whom inheritance was claimed. Moreover, &sect; 199.520(2) was not ex post facto legislation within the meaning of Ky. Const. &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant sought a nonconforming use permit to convert his greenhouse into a gas station. The application was denied, but on appeal, the board directed that the permit have been granted. The neighbor contested the board's decision in the circuit court, which held in her favor. The circuit court held that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 100.355(2), which was amended during the pendency of the proceeding, disallowed a change from one nonconforming use to another &quot;of the same or more restricted classification.&quot; The court rejected the applicant's contention that because he incurred substantial expenses in pursuing his application for the permit before &sect; 100.355(2) was amended, he should have acquired &quot;vested rights&quot; that could not have been extinguished. The court ruled that zoning laws, which were enacted pursuant to police powers, took precedence over certain &quot;vested rights&quot; based on a determination of whether the private loss outweighed the public benefit. Because the applicant's operation of the greenhouse was not a completely legal use of the land, the court held he would have been required to make expenditures showing as much regardless of whether he sought a permit.</SPAN></P>

The trial court affirmed appellees' assessment of tax, and the executor sought further review. On appeal, the court found that the decedent was a domicile of Guatemala at the time of his death, but that he owned stock in certain Kentucky corporations. The court found that there was a possibility of double taxation whether the decedent's domicile was in another state or another county. Therefore, the court held that the classification of &sect; 140.150 could not be justified as a method of equalizing the tax burden or avoiding double taxation. The court held that there were inadequate rounds to justify the discrimination of &sect; 140.150 against the decedent, as an U.S. citizen domiciled in foreign countries. The court held that this discrimination had no reasonable relation to a permitted end of government. The court ruled that &sect; 140.150 was unconstitutional and void because it set up an arbitrary standard of taxation in violation of Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant came to Kentucky from Ohio to assist in a miner's strike, and printed a pamphlet which contained defamatory material regarding a police chief and a newspaper editor. Defendant contended that to define the crime in terms of its tendency to cause a &quot;breach of the peace&quot; or lead to an indictable act was too indefinite to identify criminal conduct. The court affirmed. First, there was no issue concerning the defamatory nature of the published matter. Consequently, the possible uncertainty of the concepts of &quot;breach of the peace&quot; or &quot;indictable offense,&quot; as descriptive of the nature of defamatory matter, did not destabilize the essential elements of the offense with which defendant was charged. Second, criminal libel was no longer founded upon the tendency of the defamatory words to cause a &quot;breach of the peace&quot; or to induce others to commit a public offense. The ancient common law concept of what constituted a &quot;breach of the peace&quot; was no longer a constitutional basis for imposing criminal liability. Therefore, defendant could not fairly claim that an outmoded aspect of the impact of the defamatory words made uncertain the kind of conduct for which he was convicted.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that it had specifically recognized that enhancement in after value could be considered by the jury and had repeatedly held that it was not the value to the owner but the fair market value which controlled. The court expressed the belief that the policy denying recovery for removal and relocation costs, absent statutory authority, was a sound one. The court was persuaded that &quot;just compensation&quot; within the meaning of Ky.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 235.320 (1963), which prohibited operation of a vessel within a certain area near the Kentucky Dam. The division appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Division of Boating enacted a regulation prohibiting any vessel from operating within 100 feet of the Kentucky Dam's generator water exhaust chutes. The commercial fishermen argued that the regulation was void because it was unreasonable, arbitrary, and uncertain of determination and because it was enacted without the approval of the general assembly. The court reversed the judgment enjoining the division from enforcing the regulation. The regulation was a valid exercise of the police power of the State. The court first held that the legislature must be able to delegate certain matters to a ministerial body so that the government could function. The court then held that the evidence was substantial, convincing, and persuasive that the restricted area was dangerous. Therefore, the regulation was not unreasonable or arbitrary. The court recognized that the fishermen might suffer a financial loss but held that proper regulations were expedient and necessary to protect the public safety.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Warrants charged defendants with violating an ordinance in refusing to serve food to Negroes. In defendant one's case, the Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky) held that the ordinance was valid, but that defendant one had been placed in jeopardy in the police court and could not be retried in the circuit court. The judge presiding over defendant two's case held that the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was the validity of a city ordinance prohibiting discrimination in service in places of public accommodation on account of race, color, religious beliefs, ancestry, or national origin. The court affirmed as to defendant one, but reversed as to defendant two. Because the ordinance was held valid in defendant one's case and the only point on appeal was the ordinance's validity, there was no justiciable question in such case. The court noted that the mere fact that the state legislature chose not to give enforcement powers to the State Commission on Human Rights did not amount to a declaration of policy against the concept of compulsory integration. At the most it meant that the state was not of a mind at that particular time to enact a penal anti-discrimination statute. The court found that the city had adequate police power under the general charter for cities of the first class, particularly Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 83.010, to enact a penal anti-discrimination ordinance. The court concluded that the classification made by the ordinance had a reasonable and rational basis in the light of the purpose and objective of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a licensed manufacturer of distilled spirits, sought a declaration that a tax imposed by Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 243.680(1) was not applicable to the manufacture of distilled spirits to be exported. Appellant Department of Revenue of the Commonwealth of Kentucky opposed the suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer claimed that, if subject to the tax, he would be unable to finalize a contract to manufacture 15 barrels of bourbon whiskey for a customer in Mexico. The whiskey was to be drawn off into barrels identified for export in compliance with 26 C.F.R. 252.103, and the whiskey, when manufactured, was to be entered into the manufacturer's Class 6 U.S. Customs Bonded Manufacturing Warehouse. The trial judge assumed that the manufacturer could be relieved of the local taxes under a federal scheme allowing immunity from such taxes for certain products that met foreign competition. On appeal, the court reversed. The tax was an occupational tax on the privilege of manufacturing that preceded the time when the tax immunity of the Federal Constitution attached. The stipulated facts nowhere stated that the whiskey would be produced in a bonded manufacturing warehouse. Moreover, the whiskey was to be manufactured and drawn off before it was placed in such bonded facility. Hence, it would not be committed with certainty to the stream of exportation until it had been segregated from a common mass of distilled spirits and placed under federal supervision in the bonded warehouse.</SPAN></P>

He also claimed that there were no adequate standards for regulations, that exclusive privileges were granted, and that special acts relating to trade were illegal. Appellant argued that the Board's regulations deprived him of property without due process. The court held that (1) while appellant made arrangements to build a warehouse with an option to buy land for that purpose, the terms of the option were not provided; (2) appellant had no obligation to buy the land, and it was not certain that he would buy the land and build a warehouse; and (3) appellant had demonstrated no legal interest in the issues raised and was not affected by the regulations of which he complained.</SPAN></P>

First, the landowners posed only a hypothetical question, which was not a justiciable claim. Constitutional questions were not to be dealt with abstractly, and the court would not consider constitutionality of a statute unless the consideration was necessary to the determination of a real and vital controversy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the circuit court overruled the residents' remonstrance to the annexation, the residents appealed, but the court affirmed. It held that &sect; 81.190(4) specifically denied a right of appeal to persons who were contesting an annexation undertaken by a third class city such as appellee. In so ruling, the court also rejected a claim that the statutory denial of an appeal in such a case was unconstitutional because it was discriminatory, special legislation. It pointed to the provision in Ky. Const. &sect; 156 allowing the classification of cities for the purpose of organization and government as affording full authority for the passage of such legislation, noting that annexation was a matter of organization and government of cities. Furthermore, the court rejected a claim that the residents were nevertheless entitled to appellate review of the constitutional question of whether the annexation constitutes a taking of property without due process of law and without compensation. That was because the residents did not own any of the three tracts on which they based their due process claim. Finally, because the question of whether the city sustained its burden of proof was not reviewable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The director initiated a suit in the circuit court, which ordered an injunction requiring a hearing concerning his termination. A hearing was conducted, resulting in a formal order of dismissal. The director appealed, and the circuit court found that the charges and proof were insufficient to justify the dismissal. The circuit court held that all of the charges were defective because they did not set forth exact times and places and specific acts or omissions. On review, the court reversed that determination. The court found that the director consistently failed to submit required reports and receipts. The charge of failure to carry out instructions concerning the financial records of the vocational school was amply sufficient to sustain the director's discharge, and the trial court erred in finding otherwise. The court further found that the statute that invested the circuit court with a broader authority was invalid under Ky. Const. &sect; 27. The court held that on the factual issues, the circuit court was confined to the record of proceedings as that before the administrative body and that it was bound by the administrative decision if it was supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation's challenge to the trial court's judgment upholding appellee zoning commission's denial of appellant's request for a zoning change raised a question of administrative appeal procedure under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 100.057(2). Although the court of appeals affirmed the judgment, determining that the commission's decision was not arbitrary, it found &sect; 100.057(2) to be unconstitutional and void. The court held that regardless of whether an administrative agency was promulgating an original zoning plan or allowing adjustments to it, if it had been designated to carry out a legislative policy by the exercise of discretionary judgment in a specialized field, it was performing a nonjudicial function. The legislature could not delegate to or impose upon the judiciary such an administrative decision or require a court to substitute its independent judgment for that of an administrative agency of another branch of government. The court expressly overruled the cases of Louisville and Jefferson County Planning and Zoning Commission v. Grady, Ky., 273 S.W.2d 563, and Boyd v. Louisville and Jefferson County Planning and Zoning Commission, 313 Ky. 196, 230 S.W.2d 444.</SPAN></P>

That one member of the public specially benefited thereby did not impugn the road's public character if it was built for and open to public use. The road was designed to furnish access to and from a motel. The proposed access road was part of a comprehensive and complex highway construction plan clearly designed for public accommodation.  Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 177.250 authorized condemnation for access roads as incident to such a plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent owned five tracts of land. Her heirs filed an inheritance tax return after four of the five tracts were sold. The Commissioner sought to enforce a lien against the properties, and a partial judgment was entered that determined the estate's tax liability and that ordered the sale of the remaining tract. The proceeds were insufficient to satisfy the tax liability. The trial court then dismissed the claim. After that judgment was reversed and remanded, the trial court again dismissed the claim based on the Commissioner's failure to prove taxes due and owing and to perfect a lien against the owners as bona fide purchasers. On appeal, the court reversed. Because the earlier partial judgment regarding the estate's tax liability was not questioned by a motion or an order to revive the issue of the tax assessment 's validity or amount, the court found that that was no longer an issue in the case. The court held that the lien against the property was proper under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 140.190 without any notice to the owners because such bona fide purchasers from a decedent's estate could be charged with notice that such property could be subject to inheritance tax liability.</SPAN></P>

Under an interstate unemployment plan, the laws of the last state where a person was employed was applicable in determining such person's benefits. The trial court found that the statute violated Ky. Const. &sect; 180 and was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. The court reversed, finding no violation of &sect; 180 because taxes collected for contributions to the unemployment compensation fund were not being used for another purpose. The court also found that the delegation of power by the legislature to other states and the federal government to fix by their laws the various criteria for determining eligibility for compensation payments was not unconstitutional.

The court affirmed the trial court's order. It held that defendant did not show that had a good and sufficient cause to forestall the judgment and was unable to present it because he did not have the assistance of counsel. The allocution and formal pronouncement of sentence in defendant's presence were not constitutional rights but statutory procedures only. From a constitutional standpoint, it was sufficient that he had due and timely notice of the entry and import of the judgment and a reasonable opportunity to question it by appropriate motion. The record showed no proof to sustain a finding that defendant was denied the right of counsel to assist him in prosecuting an appeal from the judgment. Defendant had capable counsel.</SPAN></P>

The highway department challenged the trial court's condemnation award to appellees, and the court reversed, in the process setting several new standards for determining condemnation damages in the state. First, the court held that in determining and allocating damages for leased property, the proper measure was the difference in fair market value in the leasehold interest before and after the taking. The value of the leasehold was properly determined by subtracting the value of the land if sold subject to the lease from its value if sold clear of the lease. Second, the court abolished the distinction between &quot;taking&quot; and &quot;resulting&quot; damages and held the only proper consideration for juries was fixing fair market value before and after a taking.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant distiller challenged the judgment of the Franklin County Circuit Court (Kentucky), which upheld a ruling of respondent, the Kentucky Tax Commission, which denied the distiller's claim for a refund of taxes on distilled liquors imported by it from Scotland. The tax was collected while the whisky remained in unbroken packages in the hands of the distiller and prior to resale or use by the distiller.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties agreed that the whisky was an import; that it had been brought in from another country; and that the tax was collected while the whisky remained in unbroken packages in the hands of the distiller, who was the original importer, and prior to resale or use by the importer. The payment was pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 243.680(2), and the distiller paid the tax, then filed an action with the Commissioner that sought a refund. The circuit court affirmed the Commissioner's decision that refused to allow the refund, and the distiller appealed. The court reversed the judgment because the &quot;Import-Export Clause,&quot; United States Const. art. 1, &sect; 10, cl. 2, protected goods imported for sale from state taxation while they were in their original packages and had not been sold or used by the importer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that the amendments to Ky. Rev. Stat. ch. 126 were unconstitutional because they contravened Ky.

Amend. XIV by arbitrarily extending the absentee voting privilege to some voters but not all voters. The court ruled that the provisions of Ky. Rev. Stat. ch. 126 did not deprive anyone of his right to vote, did not impinge upon the constitutional guaranty of free and equal elections, and did not violate the constitutional provision against special legislation since they extend a privilege to two reasonably classified groups properly designated as recipients thereof. The challenged classification was not violative of either the Kentucky or the Federal Constitution and, therefore, the amendments to Ky. Rev. Stat. ch. 126 were valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth brought a condemnation action against a property owner. The circuit court entered judgment in a certain amount against the Commonwealth. The circuit court denied the Commonwealth's motion for a new trial, and the Commonwealth appealed. During pendency of the appeal, the circuit court caused execution of the judgment. When the circuit court refused to quash the execution, the Commonwealth filed a petition for a writ to order the circuit court to withdraw, quash, and set aside the execution on the ground that it was erroneously obtained. An ex parte temporary writ was issued. The court then denied a permanent writ on the ground that the Commonwealth failed to make the circuit court judge a party to the proceeding. The court held that the circuit court was incapable of any action except by and through the judge; because the writ proceeding was in the nature of a personal action, the officer against whom the writ was sought therefore had to be sued by name. While the proceeding was thus dismissed, the court nevertheless addressed the merits, holding that there was no legislative authority for the Commonwealth's property to be subjected to sale under execution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In administrative proceedings in which two former employees of the department claimed they were wrongfully discharged, the commissioner contracted for the services of private counsel to represent him.

The court held that the commissioner's counsel fees were not payable out of public funds pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12.210 because the commissioner did not seek or obtain approval from the Governor. The court determined the enactment of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 150.018 did not change the requirement that the Governor's approval was required where it was simply enacted to preserve the department's status quo. The court concluded the trial court could not regulate or limit the proceedings pending before the board because appellants' due process rights were adequately protected by the constitutional requirement that the board could not act arbitrarily.</SPAN></P>

South Carolina's parole board issued warrants to have the defendants returned for parole revocation hearings, and Tennessee officers arrested them. A federal marshal served warrants on felony charges in Kentucky to the Tennessee authorities, and defendants were released to him without their consent. Upon conviction in Kentucky, they were sentenced to five years each. Defendants were granted bail pending the appeal of those convictions, but detained on the South Carolina warrants. Defendants sought habeas relief and claimed South Carolina's jurisdiction and right to enforce prison terms on prior convictions was waived or forfeited when they were released to the marshal. On appeal, the court affirmed the detention and held that only South Carolina courts could determine whether or not their right to retake defendants was waived or forfeited.

The Administrators declined to approve the application after a protest was filed by interested citizens. The applicant appealed to the Board. The Board rejected the application under the authority of Ky. Rev.

The applicant appealed to the circuit court, which set aside the Board's order on the ground that it had exceeded its authority. On appeal, the court held that the facts found by the Board constituted a legally sufficient basis for the exercise of its discretion in denying the license because the findings were based upon substantial objections to the location of the applicant's premises.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chief's removal was based upon a finding that he was guilty of neglect of duty as defined in Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 63.090. Specifically, the Governor found that the evidence was overwhelming that there was flagrant and notorious violation of the laws, especially the gambling laws, in the incorporated towns of the county. He further determined that the chief, whose jurisdiction under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 70.540 was coextensive with the county, knew or should have known of these violations. The court affirmed the order of removal. In seeking to have the Governor's order cancelled, the chief contended that since he diligently executed an order of the county court regarding patrol of the incorporated and unincorporated areas of the county, his failure to enforce the law within the incorporated areas of the county did not constitute neglect of duty. The court held that such an order did not relieve the chief of his statutory duty to enforce the law throughout all areas of the county and, therefore, did not preclude the Governor from removing from office a peace officer whom the Governor had found to be guilty of neglect of his official duties.</SPAN></P>

The opponents filed a declaratory judgment action to determine whether the county judge had authority to make the appointments under the statute. The circuit court held that the appointments by the county judge were invalid. On appeal, the proponents maintained that the power granted by the statute to the county judge was not limited to the filling of vacancies; and that whenever there was a deadlock on the question of whether one person or another should hold a particular position the power of appointment, with the concomitant power of removal, passed to the county judge. The court reversed in part and held that the purported appointments by the county judge were invalid because the statute applied only to the filling of vacancies.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first denied the citizens' claim that the statute violated Ky.

The court held that the taxing power was limited under the statute and that ample remedies for overassessment of property were available. Moreover, the courts were always open for redress against the exercise of arbitrary power by administrative officials which might result in injury to any person. Although the court agreed with the citizens that their action was not an election contest, their complaint did not comply with requirements for contesting a referendum on a public question. Evidence supported the finding that the statutory procedures for the formation of a watershed conservancy district had been substantially observed. Finally, the court found that the description of the boundary or area contained in the order of the joint board of supervisors setting up the district was sufficiently definite.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The act in question redrew the voting districts of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. It created seven districts and one of the districts consisted of three urban counties in the north of Kentucky with a narrow strip along the Ohio River connected to rural counties in south-central Kentucky. Also, there was a wide disparity in population between the most populous district and the least populous district. The challenger brought a declaratory judgment action against the official, contending that the redistricting act was arbitrary in violation of Ky. Const. &sect; 6, which required that all elections were to be free and equal. The trial court upheld the act, the challenger appealed, and the court affirmed. As to the population disparity, the court held that, considering the special problems inherent in splitting up a single densely populated county and grafting a slice of it onto another and dissimilar district, the solution chosen by the legislature was not clearly arbitrary and unreasonable. As to the hybrid urban-rural district, the court likewise found that there was no constitutional violation. Compactness was formerly, but was no longer, a statutory requirement imposed by Congress.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The senator was duly elected to the state senate, and he was thereafter appointed as a deputy sheriff in a certain county and performed the duties of that office in conjunction with those of the office of senator.

The treasurer refused to honor such warrants, and appellants brought an action against her. The chancellor entered judgment for the treasurer, and appellants sought review. The court held that while the treasurer acted in good faith, upon a substantial constitutional ground, in raising a question for judicial determination as to the legality of appellants' claim, the senator was entitled to the compensation and allowances represented by the warrants because his alleged disqualification was a question over which the state legislature had continuing jurisdiction, and the court was without jurisdiction to review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted for violating &sect; 436.160 by having their businesses opened on Sunday. Defendants' convictions were dismissed by the circuit court, and the Commonwealth appealed. The court held that the exception in &sect; 436.160 for persons who were members of a religious society that observed as a Sabbath a day in the week other than Sunday did not create a discrimination against persons who observed Sunday as the Sabbath because the exemption did not affirmatively prefer any religion or amount to the establishment of a religion. Rather, it simply avoided penalizing economically the person who conscientiously observed a Sabbath other than Sunday. The subsequent statutes, which permitted sales of alcoholic beverages on Sunday, merely constituted additional exemptions from the Sunday Closing Law. Abandonment of &sect; 436.160 was not evidenced by a statute that required time-and-a-half pay for work on the seventh day of the week because the legislature could have imposed the extra wage requirement in recognition of the fact that a considerable variety of Sunday work was lawful by reason of exemptions from the Sunday Closing Law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's land was sold to appellee under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 91.540 for city taxes owed by appellant. The trial court refused to set aside the judgment an appellant sought review. The court held that a judgment based upon or an unconstitutional statute was not void. Appellant instituted an action against appellee seeking a declaration that &sect; 91.540 was unconstitutional and an adjudication that appellant had title to the land subject only to a lien in favor of appellee for the delinquent taxes, penalties and interest. Appellant challenged the trial court's dismissal of the action. The court determined that because a deed under &sect; 91.540 did not foreclose all rights of the taxpayer, there was no provision or principle of the Constitution that required appellant be given opportunity for a hearing before rather the deed was executed. There was relief available if appellee hadmisled appellant in such a way as to cause him not to exercise his right of redemption. The sale of appellant's land was not a taking for a public purpose, but a step in the foreclosure of a lien imposed under the taxing power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth on behalf of the Commissioner brought an action against the taxpayers to enforce an inheritance tax lien. The trial court dismissed the action, holding that the inheritance tax law under &sect; 47.010 violated Ky. Const. &sect; 180. On appeal, the court noted that the Act of 1936 (Act), by which the current inheritance tax law was enacted, provided that proceeds of the tax should be credited to the general fund in the state treasury; such provision was later omitted on the ground that it was covered by newly enacted Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47.010, which generally stated that all state revenue should be credited to the state general fund. The court then rejected the taxpayers' argument that &sect; 47.010 violated Ky. Const. &sect; 180 because &sect; 180 required each tax law to contain its own specification of purpose of the inheritance tax law; rather, the court held that &sect; 180 only required that a tax act contain a specification of purpose at the time it was enacted and that it was not necessary that such act continue to carry the specifying provision. Thus, omission of such provision in the Act did not render the Act, pursuant to which Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47.010 was enacted, invalid.</SPAN></P>

The Board of Education filed an action alleging that the prevailing wages rates were arbitrary, capricious and unlawful. The trial court found that the wage rates were based substantially upon union rates fixed in labor union contracts applicable to areas other than the county and that the overwhelming majority of laborers available for employment on the county project were not covered by collective agreements or understandings between employers and labor organizations in the county. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the Wage Board could not fix local prevailing wage rates based upon labor union contracts or understandings applicable to other localities when an adequate and representative labor force where the work was to be performed was not covered by such agreements or understandings.</SPAN></P>

The railroad challenged the ordinance and successfully argued that it unconstitutionally deprived it of its property without due process of law, constituted a direct and confiscatory burden on interstate commerce, and denied it the equal protection of the law. In reversing, the court held that &sect; 96.070 expressly allowed the City, through its board of council, to compel the railroad to erect and maintain the gates. The ordinance would not be declared invalid merely because it worked a hardship on the railroad. Although &sect; 96.070 was silent as to who was required to assume the expense of erecting the gates, the statute clearly implied that the railroad was required to assume it. The regulation, enacted for the public safety under the City's police power, did not constitute an unconstitutional taking of private property without just compensation. A penalty could be imposed for noncompliance, but a reasonable time to comply was implied in the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant car owner, as a class representative, disputed a decision of a trial court (Kentucky), which construed Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 138.460, as amended by 1960 Ky. Acts 5, 186, as exacting a motor vehicle usage tax, despite the fact that the owner paid a sales and use tax on the car in registering it in Michigan. The owner disputed the trial court's construction of &sect; 138.460 and its constitutionality under the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the owner, who had moved from Michigan, attempted to register and license his car in Kentucky pursuant to &sect; 138.460, a clerk refused to register the car, because the owner declined to pay the Kentucky usage tax on the car. On appeal, the court attempted to construe &sect; 138.460 in the light of other provisions of 1960 Ky. Acts 5. The court noted that, under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 138.470(3), before its amendment by 1960 Ky. Acts 5, there would have been an exemption for the owner's car. The court held that there was ambiguity in the statutes due to the inconsistency between the main sales and use tax provisions of 1960 Ky. Acts 5, art. I, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 139, and the motor vehicle use statute, 1960 Ky. Acts 5, art. II, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 138.450 et seq. With one voice the legislature had excluded the owner's car from the use tax and with another had silently implied that the car was included. The court held that the owner and others similarly situated were entitled to have their motor vehicles registered and licensed in Kentucky upon proving they had paid similar and equal taxes in another state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When state law was amended, under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 272.130(1)(d), to permit the perpetual existence of associations, two-thirds of the association's directors voted to extend the association's term to allow for a perpetual existence. In their action against the association, the members contended that the directors' vote was unconstitutional because it impaired the obligation of a contract in violation of Ky. Const. &sect; 19 and U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10. On appeal from the trial court's entry of judgment for the association, the court, in affirming the judgment, held that the contract impairment provisions of U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10 and Ky. Const. &sect; 19 did not apply to the contract between the state and the association because Ky. Const. &sect; 3 reserved to the state the right to revoke, alter, or amend an association's charter. Additionally, the association's extension to a perpetual existence did not impair the contract between the members and the association because the members were not compelled to continue membership for a period greater than contemplated when they became members; the association's by-laws gave all members the right to voluntarily withdraw from the association.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The interstate pipeline company entered into an easement agreement with the owners of the land on which the tenant was grazing cattle. The tenant was also a party to the easement agreement, with the result that he stood on the same footing as the owners of the land in respect to any violation of its terms. The agreement recited that the company would not damage any buildings or ponds or other property off the right-of-way easement. The tenant filed an action seeking recovery for damages allegedly caused to his cattle. The lower court dismissed the suit as time-barred under &sect; 413.140, which provided that any action for injury to livestock by a railroad or a corporation had to be brought within one year. The tenant argued on appeal that the suit was based upon the violation of a written contract and not a tort action and was therefore governed by the 15-year statute of limitations. The court held that it was the object rather than the form of the action, which controlled in determining the limitation period. Because the object of the tenant's action was to recover for alleged injuries to cattle, it was barred by the one-year statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

The present property owner filed a new application seeking the same zoning change, which was again denied but without a hearing. The issue before the court was whether the circuit court on appeal could review the action of the Commission in rejecting, without a public hearing, a new application. The court held that the right of appeal fixed by Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 100.057 was for the purpose of having a retrial of the merits of an application after a public hearing before the Commission. The circuit court could not conduct a new trial if there was no public hearing before the Commission. If the Commission acted contrary to law in rejecting his application without a public hearing, his recourse was an independent action for a determination of this question. The appeal procedure prescribed in &sect; 100.057 was limited to a retrial of the merits of an application and did not extend to a review of the Commission's alleged improper exercise of authority.</SPAN></P>

The Act had a valid public purpose within the scope of Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 3, 171, 177, because its ultimate purpose was to contribute to the welfare of the people of Kentucky.

</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Turnpike Authority of Kentucky and its members, sought review of a Kentucky trial court, which declared unconstitutional three provisions of an act, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 175.410 to 175.990, authorizing the Authority to lease turnpikes for an agreed rental, and upheld the remainder of the Act. The Act had been challenged by appellee taxpayers, which sought a declaration of rights under the Act, and the taxpayers cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act authorized the Authority to construct toll roads, to issue revenue bonds to finance them, and allowed the Department of Highways to lease the turnpikes. The trial court found that &sect; 17 of the Act, relating to bonds being declared eligible investments for fiduciaries, was not germane to the title; that provisions &sect;&sect; 7(h) and 12(5) of the Act, authorizing pledges extending beyond the biennium, created a debt in violation of Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 49, 50; and that provision &sect; 12(4), authorizing the Department to make up deficiencies, also created a debt in violation of the state constitution. To the extent that the Department was authorized to obligate previously unencumbered revenues anticipated for a two-year period, it was constitutional. An automatic renewal did not make the lease a long-term obligation. The renewal option was not fatal if exercised before the beginning of the biennium where it did not become valid until the appropriation became law. The Department was not entitled to make up deficiencies from fund or tax revenues because it amounted to a pledge requiring satisfaction out of general revenues ahead of all other requirements of the agency.</SPAN></P>

The court further reversed injunctive relief granted against the implementation of those sections. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 64.185 (1956), which prescribed a schedule of minimum salaries to be paid to coroners by their counties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One provision of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 64.185 (1956) required any county containing a city of 50,000 population or more to pay the coroner a supplementary salary at least equal to the minimum prescribed to be paid by the county. The court found that such a requirement violated Ky. Const. &sect; 171, which mandated that taxes be levied and collected for public purposes only. The services provided by the coroner did not perform a function of or for the city as a political unit. The coroner by constitutional designation was a county officer, and the services he performed had historically and traditionally been performed by such an officer. Thus, the provision of the statute requiring certain cities to contribute to the salary of the coroner, as well as the provision authorizing any city to provide compensation for one or more deputy coroners, was unconstitutional. However, the unconstitutionality of these provisions did not invalidate the entire statute. Applying Ky. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission authorized a revenue bond issue for the purpose of constructing improvements and facilities in certain designated state parks. Appellants filed suit in their individual capacities as citizens and taxpayers and also as owners of private vacation facilities, questioned the legality of the proposed issue in a declaratory judgment action. The lower court refused appellants' offer to file an amended complaint and sustained the commission's motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. In affirming, the court noted that Ky. R. Civ. P. 15.01 provided that a party might amend his pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading was served. The offered pleading alleged additional grounds of attack on the legality and validity of the bond issue. Although the lower court erred in refusing to permit the amendment, the court found that the refusal to permit the filing of the amended complaint was not reversible error. The provision for payment of maintenance, repair, and insurance costs of the state park system did not constitute the creation of a debt in violation of the Kentucky Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The Act required the municipality to make contributions to the pension fund, upon an actuarially determined basis, out of the general fund of the municipality. The municipality contended that the Act infringed an inherent right of local self-government and that it violated Ky. Const. &sect; 181. The court reversed the trial court's judgment finding the Act unconstitutional and granted judgment for the board of trustees. The court rejected the theory that a right of local self-government inhered in Kentucky municipalities and concluded that Ky. Const. &sect; 181 did not prohibit the General Assembly from requiring the municipality to levy taxes or expend city funds for the purpose of police and fire departments. The court concluded that the police and fire departments were not matters of strictly local concern but were of general public concern within the meaning of &sect; 181 of the Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The advertiser owned land upon which it engaged in the business of selling billboard advertising space. The housing commission condemned certain parcels of the land. For this, the trial court jury awarded damages. The advertiser argued that the statute authorizing the condemnation was unconstitutional. The court found that the statute was constitutional based on a prior decision. The court found that the fundamental problem involved the proper measure of damages. The advertiser had introduced no evidence at trial concerning the market value of the land. It did, however, undertake to prove that the particular parcels had a very special value in the operation of its billboard advertising business. It's witnesses testified to the importance of strategic locations, the method of selling advertising space by &quot;package,&quot; and the effect of the loss of one billboard sign upon its entire business. The court reversed. The evidence presented was irrelevant and incompetent. Incidental injury to business did not constitute property taken for which just compensation was to be made. Profits were too remote and speculative to furnish a market value of the property taken.</SPAN></P>

The trial court declared certain portions of the &quot;Hot Bath&quot; ordinances invalid and held that the hardship amendment was ineffective because it provided no standards for the determination of exceptions. The trial court also construed the legislation as inapplicable to real estate agents. Appellees argued that the 1956 amending ordinances were unreasonable, exceeded the City's police power, and were an unconstitutional invasion of the property rights affected. The court held that the minimum housing standards were reasonable and within the scope of the City's police powers because the purpose of the ordinances was to prevent the development of slums and blighted areas.</SPAN></P>

Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 128, 133, 137, and138 allowed the legislature to divide the state into judicial districts placing restrictions upon the size of each district.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to its enactment of veterans bonus legislation, the state legislature passed a bill providing for the manner in which the bonus was to be paid. A number of suits were initiated and consolidated for consideration. The trial court upheld the validity of the bill. On appeal, the court noted that the definition of &quot;qualified veteran,&quot; the person to whom or to whose beneficiary a bonus was to be paid, appeared to be the primary issue for decision. The court found that, because the payment of a veterans bonus was to rehabilitate present citizens, the legislature did not act unreasonably in generally classifying or confining qualified veterans to those who were residents of the state at the time the electorate approved the payment of a bonus. However, the court held that 1960 Ky. Acts 15, &sect; 3(G), which attempted to provide for payment of benefits to nonresident veterans who resided in an incorporated town, part of which lay in Kentucky, was invalid to that extent because residency was the essential element for qualification of a veteran under the legislation.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the uncertainty concerning legislative intent, coupled with the uncertainty that the legislature intended to abolish the time differential long recognized and observed in northern and eastern Kentucky, compelled the conclusion that the controlling language of &sect; 2.160 was too indefinite to be given effect. Thus, the court held that it could not be invoked as prohibiting the action taken by the city. The court noted that the ICC regulation placed certain cities in the Commonwealth in the central time zone while areas across the river in neighboring Ohio were in the eastern time zone. According to the court, the legislature could not have intended to place these Kentucky areas, which had observed eastern time for at least 40 years, in the central time zone.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's contention, finding that (1) the purpose of the statute was to protect the morals and health of a minor; and (2) because it was impossible to detail all of the acts which could conceivably fall within the condemnation of the statute as delinquencies or contributing to delinquency, it was necessary to use general terms. The court also stated that it was within the province of the jury to believe the child's testimony, supported by the testimony of her parents, or to believe defendant's uncorroborated testimony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee filed an action for injunctive relief attacking the validity of a proposed constitutional amendment which provided a method of financing a veterans' bonus. The amendment was approved by a majority vote in a statewide election. The lower court ruled in appellee's favor, holding that the legislative act had not been validly passed by the state legislature because veteran members of the General Assembly had a personal interest in the subject matter in violation of the state constitution. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the act had not violated the federal or state constitutions because the right of the legislature to enact reasonable veterans' bonus legislation was a proper public purpose. Furthermore, veteran members of the legislature had a right to vote on the legislation because veteran members of the legislature had no personal or private interest in the particular legislation under consideration because the act was nothing more than enabling legislation. It sought a vote of the people on the property of incurring an indebtedness to pay a veterans' bonus, but no personal or private rights were acquired by anyone thereunder.</SPAN></P>

The City filed a cross-action against the owner and alleged that the owner was primarily liable under &sect; 381.445 and that the City was entitled to indemnification for any damage award against the City. Section 381.445 imposed primary liability upon the owner of property abutting a sidewalk in a city of the first class for injuries to persons or property arising out of a failure of the property owner to repair a defect in the sidewalk. The circuit court held that &sect; 381.445 was special legislation in violation of Ky. Const. &sect; 59(29), arbitrary, and violative of due process. Accordingly, the circuit court dismissed the pedestrian's complaint against the owner and the City's cross-action. On appeal by the City, the court held that Ky.

The size of the City did not afford a reasonable ground for the special legislation, and a general and uniform law on the subject could have been made applicable to all cities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant's ex-wife obtained a divorce from him, the judgment awarded child custody to her, but it did not make any provision for child support because defendant had been proceeded against as a nonresident. After the ex-wife obtained a judgment for support, defendant failed to make payments, and he was indicted, tried, and convicted for that failure. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the indictment was not fatally defective for failure to allege that the children were residents of Kentucky because the children's residence was not a material element of the offense set forth in &sect; 435.240(3)(a). Further, venue was proper in Powell County because the prosecution alleged and proved that that county was the county in which the divorce judgment was rendered. In addition, the instant action had been brought under a later version of &sect; 435.240, and the constitutionality of that statute had been upheld. Finally, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the verdict because defendant was physically and financially able to comply with the statute, and financial assistance by the ex-wife's family did not absolve defendant from his paternal obligations.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the elimination of slums and blight were legitimate objectives for the exercise of the state's police power and that there was no improper delegation of legislative power. The court held that the ballot question stated the essentials clearly. The court also held that the city was not required to advertise its ordinance which provided for the mode of creating and paying the indebtedness authorized by the electorate, because Ky. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 94.294 authorized the city to make and finance a street improvement by &quot;stages&quot;. Under that authority, the ordinance in question provided a program for improving streets in the following manner: (1) each street was to be graded to a certain width and was to be surfaced with gravel and limestone roadmix; (2) curbs, gutters and storm sewers were to be installed; (3) the surface was to widened; (4) the base surface was to be covered with hot mixed blacktop. The obvious objective of the ordinance was to program for completion in a series of projects, either the original construction or a substantial reconstruction of city streets. The landowners contended that some of the phases of the work, particularly surfacing and resurfacing the streets, was nothing more than repair, and that the city could not levy a street assessment for such type of work. It was clear that each item of the work constituted an integral part of a new construction of the streets. In addition to that, however, the ordinance provided for grading, widening, and the installation of curbs, gutters, and storm sewers. The whole project, and each part of it, constituted an improvement and not a repair.</SPAN></P>

The brewer alleged that the city was precluded from imposing any &quot;license&quot; fee or tax on brewers in excess of the $ 500 fee permitted by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 243.070.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city imposed a $ 500 annual license fee on the brewer pursuant to &sect; 243.070. In addition, the city imposed a general occupational license tax applicable to substantially all businesses in the city. The question was whether &sect; 243.070 imposed a $ 500 limit on the city's total license taxing power as it related to brewers, or whether it merely restricted the amount of the regulatory fee the city could impose, leaving unrestricted the city's general power to impose license taxes for revenue purposes. The court held that &sect; 243.070 did impose a $ 500 limit on the city's total taxing power. Section 243.070, in placing a limit on city &quot;license fees,&quot; referred to all license fees, regardless of whether they were imposed for the purpose of regulation or for the purpose of raising revenue. Therefore, the city's occupational license tax, which had to be considered to be a license fee because the city's power to impose it derived only from its authority under Ky. Const. &sect; 181 to impose such &quot;license fees,&quot; could not be assessed against the brewer in addition to his $ 500 annual license fee.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that where a conflict arose in applying Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 133 and 235, &sect; 235 that had to give way. The court explained that the requirement of Ky. Const. &sect; 133 that the compensation be equal and uniform and adequate had to be given effect so as to validate the payment of the compensation fixed by 1958 Ky. Acts ch. 25, &sect; 1, compiled as Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 64.498, to all of the judges. The court noted that when the legislature increased the compensation payable out of the state treasury to circuit judges and its payment to some of the judges would not violate Ky. Const. &sect; 235, but its payment to others would have, the equal, uniform and adequate clause of Ky. Const. &sect; 133 required that there be equality and uniformity in the payment of the new compensation. The court concluded that 1958 Ky. Acts ch. 25, &sect; 1, compiled as Ky. Rev.

Plaintiff had agreements with numerous Kentucky retailers that plaintiff's products would not be advertised, offered for sale, or sold by the dealer at less than the minimum retail resale prices stipulated by plaintiff.

On review, the court found that statute was unconstitutional in that it was special legislation that singled out business owners for prosecution should they not comply, while others were not subject to the same prosecution. The court further found that the legislature shirked its duty by calling upon future, and non-existent, federal law to affect policy of the state.

It found that traditionally, in Kentucky, legislative bodies had been vested with the authority to determine the election of their members.

On appeal the court reversed, holding that the circuit court improperly undertook to rule upon the validity of the special use section of the zoning ordinance because holding unconstitutional the part of the ordinance in question accomplished no purpose where the fire department was still faced with the remaining portions of the ordinance barring the erection of the desired building.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court had found that the decedent's will was a forgery and set aside the probate of the will. The widow filed a motion two years later to set aside the judgment. The probate court refused, and the lower court affirmed. The widow appealed that judgment and a judgment denying certain claims. Appellants also contested administrative and attorney fees. The court affirmed the judgments, holding that: (1) the finding that the will was forged was based on the widow's own admission in her answer to the complaint; (2) the widow's claims, including a claim for attorney fees in defending the criminal prosecution against her, were properly disallowed; (3) an amended law, which would have made the widow the sole heir, was not in effect at the time of the decedent's death; and (4) the administrator's fee, which exceeded the normal rate, was excessive because the estate's administration involved no extraordinary trouble, and the litigation did not involve extra work for the administrator. But his attorney's fee was not excessive in light of the needless litigation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An election was held on the question of issuing bonds for the construction of a courthouse and jail. The result of the election showed that the question had failed to receive the required majority of favorable votes. Recount proceedings were instituted, as a result of which a judgment was entered declaring that the question had carried by the required number of votes. The taxpayer, suing as a taxpayer and on behalf of all other taxpayers of the county, sought to have the recount judgment declared void. The court affirmed the dismissal of his complaint, holding that the taxpayer did not have standing to question the recount judgment. The court held that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 122.140 authorized the bringing of an action to contest or for recount of an election on a public question by any elector who was qualified to and did vote on the question. Thus, the court held that because the taxpayer solely in his capacity as such did not have a right of contest or recount, there was no basis upon which he could assert a justiciable interest in the results of a contest or recount proceeding. The court ruled that the right to contest an election was purely statutory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted in 1952 of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to five years' imprisonment. The sentencing court entered an order probating petitioner for seven years upon specified conditions. On motion of the Commonwealth to set aside the order of probation, a court found that petitioner had violated the terms of his probation and, in 1958, set aside the order of probation and entered judgment upon the verdict entered in 1952. Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus for release from custody. The trial court denied habeas corpus. Petitioner contended that under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 439.270 his period of probation had terminated, by operation of law, at the end of five years from the date of the verdict. The court affirmed denial of the writ of habeas corpus and entry of judgment upon the 1952 verdict. Retrospective application of the limitation of a maximum period of five years' probation would breach the wall of separation between legislative and judicial powers. In declaring a retrospective application of the maximum probation period the legislature was encroaching upon a judicial function and power which had already been exercised.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 320.200 et seq. only applied to optometrists. The court determined that both Acts applied to appellants because the phrase &quot;any person&quot; was not restrictive and included optometrists and appellants. The plain and obvious meaning of the statutes established that all persons were prohibited from advertising the cost or sale price of visual aid glasses. The court found that the Ophthalmic Dispensers Act, Ky. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court determined that the statutes that purported to grant a pension to the judge were unconstitutional in that they allowed the judge compensation in excess of the maximum set forth by Ky.

Stat. &sect; 246 had since raised the limit of police judges' salary so that the statutory pension did not exceed the constitutional maximum. The court also held that the judge's pension was for the public service contemplated by &sect; 3. The court found that the judge was entitled to the pension because he fell within the scope of the statutes and because the statutes did not prohibit a pensioner from being employed by the city in another capacity or from holding an elected municipal office.</SPAN></P>

The hospital was to be used as a teaching facility in connection with the university's school of medicine. The university filed condemnation actions against several owners. The trial court found in favor of the university. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the university was a municipal university within the meaning of Ky.

The court noted that the legislature had the inherent right to delegate the power of eminent domain when, in exercising that power, the delegatee accomplished something in the nature of a public purpose or to serve the public good and the common welfare. The court noted that the medical school was the only medical school in the state. The state, therefore, had a vital interest in the functions of the university in furthering the public welfare.

The court modified the judgment by limiting its broadness and holding that &sect; 149 was unconstitutional only as so far as the transportation company was concerned and that the whole statute was not invalid. The court found that a republication of a subsection of the statute constituted publication of the law within the meaning of Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court allowed the sheriff a fee of three percent of the total school tax collections, which the board argued exceeded the reasonable cost of collection. While the trial court made findings that the value placed on the sheriff's own services, the amount properly allowed for deputies' services, the percentage of time devoted to tax collection work, and the amount allowable for automobile mileage justified the fee, he did not base his allowance on those findings. Instead, he made the award on the theory that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 134.310(6) was valid and that, while under that statute the sheriff would have been entitled to a larger fee, having only asked for three percent, he was limited to that amount. The court held that--as subsequent to the trial court's judgment in the case, it had found &sect; 134.310(6)&nbsp;unconstitutional--the trial court erred in holding that statute valid. However, this did not require the allowed fee to be set aside, since adequate other grounds existed for its allowance. Because the sheriff retained four percent of the amount collected, he should have been charged interest on the one percent over the allowed fee during the time that he retained it.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that &sect; 220.510 also did not impair the bondholders' contracts with the city. The court also held that &sect; 220.510 did not give the district the power of unjustified discrimination because the statute clearly provided for two classes, those who paid their water bills and those who did not. Finally, the court held that the district had the right to impose a 10 percent penalty upon those who failed to pay their bills on time because such power came within the powers specifically granted to it to fix rates.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed to the extent that the judgment held taxable the intangibles having a business situs in other states. The property was beyond the jurisdiction of Kentucky to tax because it afforded no protection to the intangible property. The attempted levy of a direct ad valorem property tax thereon was unconstitutional and void as a violation of the Due Process Clause. The commonwealth could not tax the out of state property as a condition for permitting the taxpayer to be organized in Kentucky. The court affirmed to the extent that the judgment taxed as omitted property the amount representing gasoline tax on accounts receivable for gasoline sold to dealers in Kentucky. The taxpayer listed these accounts for taxation at 70 percent of their face value. The amount of tax that the taxpayer had to pay to the commonwealth was recovered by increasing the customer's price. The complete failure to list 30 percent of the accounts amounted to an omission, not a mere undervaluation.</SPAN></P>

The judgment was based on the fact that the railroad company had not offered evidence to rebut the presumption of negligence created by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 277.330.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mule had strayed from the owner's premises about a mile from the place on the track where it was struck and killed. Section 277.330 provided that the killing or injury of cattle by the engine or cars of any railroad company was prima facie evidence of negligence on the part of the agents and servants of the company. The constitutionality of such legislation was previously sustained because it applied to all similar corporations and had for its object the safety of persons on a train and the protection of property. However, there were no automobiles in those days. The operators of motor vehicles were not subject to the same extraordinary legal responsibility for killing animals on the public roads as were railroad companies for killing them on their private rights of way. The purpose of Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 3, 59 and of U.S. Const. amend. XIV was to place all persons similarly situated upon a plane of equality and to render it impossible for any class to obtain preferred treatment.Thus, the part of &sect; 277.330 that imposed a duty upon a railroad company to prove that it was free from negligence in the killing or injury of cattle by its engine or cars was invalid and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court refused to enjoin the sale but held invalid that portion of the judgment that enjoined their involvement in the various types of businesses. Both parties appealed. The court reversed in part and held that the trial court erred in striking the language prohibiting defendants from operating in the businesses described.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The holder of title derived from a junior patent commenced the action to quiet title to land after &sect; 56.190(2) was enacted. That provision established the validity of land patents issued after previous patents to the same land were deemed void. The circuit court dismissed the petition, finding that &sect; 56.190(2) was unconstitutional by virtue of its retroactive impairment of vested rights held by senior patent owners. The court reversed the judgment. The court first noted that when &sect; 56.190(2) was passed, an appeal was pending in litigation involving the same issue. The court concluded that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter. The court also ruled that &sect; 56.190(2) did not impair the rights of the holder of title derived from the senior patent. The County Court Order Act, 1834-35 Ky. Acts ch. 875, p. 259, as amended, and as construed in Kentucky courts, rendered the title derived from the senior patent void insofar as it covered lands in a second county. Therefore, the junior patent had precedence over the senior patent, with regard to that land. The rights of the holder of title derived from a senior patent were not impaired by enactment of &sect; 56.190(2).</SPAN></P>

A state sheriffs' association intervened in the action. A trial court (Kentucky) entered a judgment for the board.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff withheld a commission of four percent of all school taxes collected under the provisions of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 134.310 (1954). The trial court found that the reasonable cost of collecting school taxes was 2.78 percent. The board asserted that the reasonable cost of collection was no more than one percent. The trial court interpreted &sect; 134.310 so as to permit the payment of general expenses of the sheriff's office from the commissions allowed to him by law but that the statute did not allow him to defray his general expenses against school taxes up to four percent, without regard to the reasonable cost of collection. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 134.510, which permitted the sheriff's general expenses to be paid from the school taxes collected up to four percent, was unconstitutional to the extent that it permitted a diversion of school taxes for non-school purposes. The trial court's determination as to the appropriate allowance for the sheriff's compensation was not erroneous, however, there was insufficient proof showing that the mileage allowed for traveling had been done in tax collection work.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, adopting the opinion of the trial judge. The court held, among other things, that the Bill did not violate Ky.

The court rejected the argument that, because other cities were also in dire need of additional revenue, the Bill was not based on a reasonable classification. Instead, the court took judicial notice of the burgeoning population of the county's largest city and, giving the Bill the presumption of constitutionality, found that the classification was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer owned intangible personal property, which a county tax commissioner assessed at 100 percent of its fair cash value. The taxpayer claimed that the assessment of intangibles at a higher rate than the assessment of real property constituted discrimination in that intangibles were required to bear a disproportionate tax burden. A county board of supervisors, the State Tax Commission, and the circuit court all affirmed the assessment. On further review, the court affirmed, holding that the assessments at different rates was not discriminatory. The court reasoned that although the original purpose of Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested on a charge of drunkenness in a public place and gave a bond for his appearance before the justice on a set date. Defendant did not appear in person on the specified date, but his attorney appeared and filed an objection to the jurisdiction of the justice. The attorney filed a motion to transfer the case to the quarterly court on the ground that a trial in the justice's court would constitute a denial of due process by reason of the pecuniary interest of the justice in the outcome of the prosecution. Justices were only paid a fee in criminal cases if a conviction resulted. The justice overruled the attorney's motion, impaneled a jury, and tried defendant in absentia. The jury fixed a fine. Defendant applied to the circuit court for an injunction to prevent the imposition of the fine. The circuit court granted the injunction. The justice appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the compensation system was unconstitutional. The court explained that the fact that defendant had a right to appeal the judgment imposed did not affect its decision. The court reasoned that defendant had a right to a fair trial with an impartial tribunal in the first instance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate was convicted in 1952 of deserting and abandoning his children by failing to pay child support ordered in a divorce decree in violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 435.240. The statute was declared unconstitutional in 1953 before he was put in jail in 1956. The inmate thereafter filed a petition to be released from jail on a writ of habeas corpus. A trial court (Kentucky) denied the petition. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case presented the question of whether a judgment of conviction of a felony under a statute subsequently declared to be unconstitutional was void. The court concluded that it was and granted habeas relief. The court noted that there was a recognized right to attack collaterally a judgment of conviction of a crime. The majority rule was that where a statute or ordinance making certain acts or omissions a crime was unconstitutional or invalid, a final judgment predicated upon the validity of such legislation was void. This was generally so upon the theory that the trial court had no jurisdiction to enter the judgment that it did. Thus, a judgment of conviction of crime based upon an unconstitutional statute was void, and a habeas corpus proceeding testing such conviction could be maintained. The court concluded that the inmate here was entitled to be relieved of the void judgment and released from custody under it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was first convicted before a justice of the peace and had appealed to the lower court. On appeal from his conviction, defendant claimed that the lower court lacked jurisdiction to try him and that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdict. The court held that the justice lacked jurisdiction to convict defendant. He was originally charged with selling beer to minors and a warrant was issued. At trial, there was insufficient evidence to convict defendant of selling beer to minors, but the justice entered a judgment convicting him of selling beer without a license. The court held that where there had been no warrant, complaint, or indictment charging defendant with selling beer without a license, the justice was without jurisdiction to so convict him. The original warrant could not be amended because doing so would impermissibly allow the addition of a wholly new offense. Where the justice was without jurisdiction, the lower court was also without jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city, in an effort to annex a part of a community to its east passed an ordinance proposing annexation. A petition of remonstrance was filed in the circuit court by a number of property holders, who were freeholders in the territory, thus requiring a trial of the question of annexation. The jury returned a verdict against annexation, and judgment was entered thereon. The city's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was denied and the city appealed. Under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 81.110, if less than 75 percent of the freeholders in the territory proposed to have been annexed have remonstrated, the issues to have been tried were whether the adding of the territory was for the interest of the city and would have caused no manifest injury to the persons owning real estate in the territory sought to have been annexed. The court reversed the judgment. There was no evidence upon which to base a finding that the annexation would have been contrary to the interests of the city. Also, there was no basis for finding that the annexation of the territory in question would have imposed such uncompensated burdens upon the property owners as to have been grievous, wearisome or oppressive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The class action challenged appellees' practice of expending public tax money in the payment of the salaries of nuns of the Roman Catholic Church teaching in the public schools of the counties when dressed in religious garb and wearing symbols of their religion. The class action further questioned the payment of rent to the Catholic Church for buildings in which public schools were taught; and the cost of transporting Catholic children to parochial schools. Appellant sought an injunction against appellees to prevent them from the illegal expenditure of public funds raised by taxation, and of school funds. The trial court denied the injunction and dismissed the action, and appellant sought review. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment, in part, for the trial court's failure to determine what, if any, sum appellee boards improperly expended in transporting parochial students. The court affirmed the remainder of the judgment, holding that while the dress and emblems worn by the sisters proclaimed to be members of certain religious organizations, they were not deprived of their right to teach in public schools, so long as they had not injected the dogma of their church.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 94.291 through 94.325.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners alleged that the Act authorizing the improvements was unconstitutional and that unless the city was enjoined from proceeding, the owners would suffer irreparable injury for which they had no adequate remedy at law. The trial court denied the owners injunctive relief, concluding that the provisions of the Act were constitutional. The court reversed, finding the Act obliterated the distinction between special assessment bonds, which were payable only from assessments on property owners, and general obligation bonds, which were payable from taxes and constituted personal debt of a municipality. The latter also constituted &quot;indebtedness&quot; subject to the requirements of Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 157, 158. The legislature apparently intended to authorize the issuance of bonds supported by the general tax funds but at the same time not subject to the constitutional requirements. Despite the fact that under the Act the city's liability was initially contingent, it nevertheless was one voluntarily created and as such had to comply with the constitutional restrictions on municipal indebtedness. Since the Act did not require such compliance, it was unconstitutional and void in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the constitution prohibited the legislature from invading the province of the judiciary and that Ky.

On appeal, appellant contended that the Department's order making the minimum charge optional exceeded the authority vested in the Department, that the Department permitted the introduction of evidence after appellee had closed its case, that the power granted by the statutes to the Department to suspend common carrier certificates was unconstitutional as a deprivation of property without due process of law and that the Department's action was arbitrary and was not supported by evidence. The court held that the statutes pertaining to rate making and publication were not voided by the language of the order, that the admitted testimony concerning the financial impact on appellee was not prejudicial because it was a matter of common knowledge, that appellant was provided with due process, and the action was not arbitrary where appellant plainly violated the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant and appellees manufactured ice and sold it to certain ice peddlers. Appellant alleged that appellees made secret payments to the ice peddlers to induce them to buy ice from appellees rather than from appellant. In a suit alleging unfair trade practices, the circuit court permanently enjoined appellees from secretly paying, refunding, or rebating any part of the purchase price of ice in violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 365.050. The circuit court did not award damages to appellant. The court affirmed the injunction, but reversed the decision to deny appellant monetary damages. The court held that evidence supported a finding that appellees violated &sect; 365.050. The court found that peddlers changed their patronage from appellant to appellees because of refunds which they anticipated receiving from appellees. This constituted a violation of &sect; 360.050, and an injunction was properly awarded under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 365.070. The court also held that appellant should have been awarded monetary damages. Appellant showed actual damages and also showed an amount of the damages it had sustained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed on cross-appeal, holding that the evidence established that appellees made secret payments to gain business and destroy competition; thus, the injunction was proper. The court reversed on the direct appeal, holding that appellant should have been awarded damages. The court directed the circuit court to ascertain and award the amount of damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant board of education sought review of a decision of a Kentucky trial court, which held that a rule promulgated by a principal of a public school was arbitrary and enjoined the principal from enforcing it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The principal of a public school promulgated a rule which provided that no student, while in school, would be allowed to enter a certain restaurant or any other business establishment in the town without permission from 8:15 A.M. until 3:00 P.M. Appellee father challenged the rule after he was notified that his two children were being suspended until they agreed to comply with the rule. The trial court enjoined the principal from enforcing the rule. On appeal, the court reversed the judgement below. The court held that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 158.150, 161.180 plainly authorized public schools to make and enforce reasonable regulations for the government of such schools during school hours. The court stated that the only concern of the courts was to determine whether the school rules and regulations were reasonable or whether they were arbitrary. The court noted that all children could be required to purchase their lunch from the school lunchroom in order to ensure the success of the school lunch program and to help maintain order. The court held that the rule appeared to be for the common good of all the children attending the school and was not unreasonable or arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 175.005 - 175.320, a highway construction financing measure. The trial court then held that the statute was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner commenced the action to obtain the Governor's compliance with the statute. The Governor challenged the validity of the provision and the trial court concluded that the enactment would result in the creation of indebtedness in violation of Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 49, 50. The court affirmed the judgment, explaining that the measure created highway authority, to which certain State highways were transferred. The Department would then lease the highways at a rental rate corresponding, approximately, to the amount accruing to the State Road Fund. The court held that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 175.130 contemplated a lease for up to 40 years, with an absolute obligation on the part of the Department, with rents derived from future appropriations to the statutory State road fund. The gasoline and motor vehicle taxes were sources of public revenue subject to the constitutional prohibitions against creating obligations against future revenues. The enactment also violated Ky. Const. &sect; 230, which restricted the expenditure of gasoline tax revenues to road purposes. The enactment evaded the constitutional prohibition against debt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was fined for public drunkenness and ordered to execute a bond to keep the peace for a period of six months. After serving sufficient time to satisfy the fine and costs that he did not pay, the prisoner sought release from jail upon a writ of habeas corpus. The circuit court held the police court of the city, which was a city of the fourth class, did not have jurisdiction to require the peace bond and consequently to commit the prisoner to jail in default of its execution. The city contended that the grant of the writ of habeas corpus was in error. In reversing, the court held that, under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 26.440 the order that required execution of the bond to keep the peace was valid and the judgment of the circuit court that the prisoner was entitled to release on the writ of habeas corpus was erroneous. The court ruled that the amendment as it affected &sect; 26.440 was unconstitutional because its title was deceptive and because it made an arbitrary distinction between police courts in violation of Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 59, 60. Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 26.440 was not repealed or amended by the unconstitutional portion of the Act.</SPAN></P>

The court held that making the right to operate an automobile upon the public highways of the state dependent upon whether a person paid his personal property taxes upon property other than the vehicle to be licensed had no relation to any of the subjects to which the police power extended.

However, so much of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 435.240(3) as made it a criminal offense to fail to perform a court judgment with respect to the support of children had been declared unconstitutional. Defendant could not be convicted under Ky. Rev.

The children were living with their mother and stepfather and were adequately supported.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board cited the bar owner for permitting a fugitive from the law to enter his premises. After a hearing, the board entered an order revoking the bar owner's beer and liquor license and directing that the premises be padlocked until the following June 30, 1953. The bar owner appealed the order to the trial court. The trial court sustained the revocation order, but set aside the padlocking order. The board appealed the part of the judgment, which held the padlocking statute,&nbsp;Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 241.060(6) to be unconstitutional. The court held that the trial court properly set aside the padlocking order. The failure of &sect; 241.060(6) to make a padlocking order contingent upon a finding by the board of the existence of a nuisance rendered it unconstitutional. The business of selling intoxicating liquors was legitimate and was not a nuisance unless it was made so by statute or unless the business was so conducted as to bring it within the definition of a nuisance. Punitive action by the board could be justified only on the theory that such action had some reasonable connection with abating or preventing conditions which constituted a nuisance. Section 241.060(6) did not so provide.</SPAN></P>

The contestant filed an action challenging the election on the ground that the absentee ballots were illegal and void. The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment in favor of the contestant. The court held that while the record did not disclose any actual fraud, such as ballot tampering or bribery, there were signs of constructive fraud. There were a number of respects in which the county court clerk failed to follow statutory requirements governing absentee voting, including his failure to insist that the ballots be taken from precinct books, that outer envelopes be supplied, and that the ballots be deposited immediately in the designated box. As the clerk was grossly negligent in not making an effort to ascertain his duties and he did not comply with the law, the absentee ballots were void, and the judgment for the contestant was proper.</SPAN></P>

The lower court found for the directors of the road district, and the court affirmed. The court found that a corner lot patently abutted on two streets and thus the owner's property abutted on the improved street. The court rejected the owner's argument that the award of attorneys' fees violated Ky. Const. &sect; 51 because the title of Ky. Rev. Stat. ch. 184, which allowed for the enforcement of the improvement lien, did not mention attorneys' fees. The title to the chapter provided for the levy of assessments against abutting property owners and the creation of a lien for those assessments. The cost of the action to enforce the lien, including the attorneys' fees, was related to the subject of enforcing liens. The court found that if the title was sufficient to put members of the state general assembly on notice of the contents of an act, and all the provisions of the act related to the same subject, were naturally connected, and were not foreign to the subject expressed in the title, then the requirements of the constitution were met.</SPAN></P>

The removal and relocation of the poles and lines at the telephone company's expense was justified under the specific provisions of the grant. Pertaining to the Kentucky Legislature's creation of the Ohio Valley Telephone Company as a corporation, the term &quot;so as not to obstruct the same&quot; related to the obstruction of improvement, construction, and reconstruction of the state's highways, as well as obstruction of travel upon completed highways.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners' property was located in an unincorporated area and was zoned by the commission for one-family residential use. When the commission denied the owners' request for a special use permit to construct a trailer park, they filed a petition to challenge that decision. The property was annexed by the city and the inspector denied the owners a permit for the same use. The inspector was joined in the pending action and appellees' answer claimed the annexation rendered the action moot. The owners' motion to strike the answer was overruled, and when they refused to plead further, the petition was dismissed. The owners appealed, contending that when the property was annexed it had no zoning classification and the inspector was precluded from denying the proposed use. The court affirmed, finding that under a city ordinance the owners' property retained its previous zoning classification unless and until the city's board of aldermen reclassified it. That ordinance did not constitute an unconstitutional delegation of the city's zoning authority because it merely recognized the status of the property pending appropriate action by the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant City of Louisville, Ky., challenged a judgment of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky) that declaring void, confiscatory, arbitrary and unconstitutional so much of City of Louisville, Ky., Ordinance 83, &sect; 9(e) (Series 1950), as amended, as imposed a minimum annual license fee upon antique dealers having no established place of business within the City and enjoining collection of the fee. Appellee antique dealers also sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court concluded that the ordinance improperly established a license fee upon nonresident antique dealers who offered their wares at annual or semiannual shows in the City. The City sought review of the judgment, as did the antique dealers, who asserted that the ordinance should have been deemed inapplicable to all itinerant, nonresident antique dealers. The court affirmed the judgment, noting that the fee exceeded the gross earnings of most antique dealers during the annual and semiannual shows. The court held that the ordinance imposed more onerous fees on nonresidents than residents, without a reasonable basis, such as a greater need for police regulation or consumer protection. The court also observed that the ordinance was a revenue, rather than a regulatory measure. The court concluded that the ordinance was an attempt to make nonresident antique dealers bear a proportionate share of the costs of government. Section 9(e) of the ordinance was unconstitutional insofar as it violated the principle of equality and uniformity by failing to provide for a refund of the amount of the license fee that exceeded the amount of tax actually incurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer suing on behalf of all taxpayers sought review of the judgment of the lower court (Kentucky), which upheld the validity of Chapter 157 of the Acts of 1950, Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 177.390 to 177.570, which provided for the construction and operation of turnpikes or toll roads, by appellee Department of Highways, to be financed through revenue bonds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to the lower court upholding the validity of Chapter 157 of the Acts of 1950, Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 177.390 to 177.570, the taxpayer appealed alleging that the Act was unconstitutional. First, the court held that the Act did not create a debt of the Commonwealth in violations of Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 49, 50, and 177 because there was no evidence that the Commonwealth would have maintained the toll road on a higher standard that other state highways, or that it would have given the toll road preference in maintenance over the other highways. The court found no element of an unconstitutional debt. Second, the court noted that the Act did not delegate legislative power to appellee Commissioner of Highways in violation of Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 27, 28, and 29, and it was not arbitrary in power in violation of Ky. Const. &sect; 2. The court noted that in regulating the use and occupancy of state property, a state officer was not exercising a legislative function but an administrative one. The court also held that the title of an act need not be an index or table of contents. The court concluded that the taxpayer's argument on this issue was without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that (1) violations penalized by Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 242.990 were separate misdemeanors of equal dignity in reaching the final result and that the third offense had to be charged within one year of the return of the indictment just as had to be done in connection with any other misdemeanor, and it was only upon a finding of guilty of the third offense that the penalty of a felony was imposed; (2) Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 242.390, which permitted, in actions for violation of local option laws, the introduction of evidence of the general reputation of a defendant for bootlegging or being engaged in transporting, selling, or keeping alcoholic beverages for the purpose of sale, was unconstitutional; and (3) the search of his car was improper. After review, the court disagreed. Statutes such as Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 242.390 merely changed a common law rule of evidence and were not in conflict with Ky. Const. &sect; 13. There was no objectionable feature in the search of defendant's car. Defendant committed a traffic violation. The officers, in discharge of their duty, stopped him and he then voluntarily submitted to a search of his automobile.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed, finding the statute unconstitutional. The court analyzed various attorney fee statutes and found that fees were usually required when the party penalized had brought about the situation in which the fees were incurred. No distinction was made in the statute for the just and unjust. The statute was thus an arbitrary imposition of fees against innocent employers. The court then held that &sect; 342.320(2) could not be severed and was invalid in its entirety. However, attorney fees were still available to parties under the valid provisions of Ky. Rev. Stat.

The court further held that the part of the indictment that drawn under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 435.240(1) failed to allege that the children abandoned were under 16 years of age in destitute or indigent circumstances and that it was no offense to abandon infant children unless they were under 16 years of age and in destitute or indigent circumstances.

The brokers contended that the nature of their occupation was not such as to justify invoking the police power and that &sect; 324 was special legislation in violation of Ky. Const. &sect; 59. The brokers claimed that &sect; 324 made an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to a state commission and that Ky. Rev.

In affirming the finding of constitutionality, the court held that the classification for licensing brokers and salesmen under Ky. Rev.

The standards of trustworthiness and competency, set up by the Legislature, were adequate standards and the state commission was given the power to put the standards into effect.

By &sect; 455.090, the an accused's failure to testify could not be commented on or create any presumption against him. In argument, the prosecutor had stated that it was not denied that defendant did the cutting; that no one could know what was in defendant's mind when he was cutting; and that, &quot;if anybody told you I didn't hear it.&quot; The court held that the argument went beyond just an inferential or isolated statement, such as &quot;Nobody has denied it.&quot; Nor was the evidence of guilt so clear and convincing that the trial court would have been warranted in holding that the prosecutor's misconduct did not prejudice defendant's substantial rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer's factory was located on both sides of an alley. It petitioned the City's Board of Commissioners to close the alley. The owner maintained that the closure would only benefit the manufacturer and filed suit to enjoin any closure. The trial court found that the City did not have the authority to pass the ordinance and issued an injunction. The manufacturer appealed from that judgment, which was reversed. The court noted that the Commissioners were vested with the City's legislative authority and that the closure of an alley was a legislative act. Moreover, a court did not have the authority to judge proposed legislation when the legislative body was acting within its prescribed powers. While there were exceptions to that rule of non-interference, they only applied when the challenged action was ultra vires or ministerial in nature or simply squandered property held in trust. The closure of an alley or other roadway, however, was a discretionary governmental function. Therefore, the owner's lawsuit was premature because the Commissioners had not yet enacted an ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Kentucky Department of Revenue, the Commissioner, and the County Court Clerk, challenged a decision from the Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky), which held that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 132.380, requiring contestants for the position of county tax commissioner to pass a certification exam, was unconstitutional. The chancellor denied injunctive relief to appellee, a contestant who failed the test, because he had an adequate remedy at law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court addressed three issues. First, the Department did not exercise arbitrary power merely because the delegating legislation did not set forth a standard for grading exam papers. The legislature correctly made a broad delegation of power to a state agency and had a right to assume that it would perform its duties fairly. If this presumption of regularity failed, it was the fault not of the statute but of the Department. Second, the statute was not invalid because it &quot;grandfathered&quot; incumbents. Classifications were not unconstitutionally discriminatory when they were reasonable. It was reasonable to allow persons who had already performed the duties of the office to be exempt from taking a qualifying exam. Finally, the court explained that the Department's failure to timely file its rules for grading exams did not make the contestant's examination void because, pursuant to ch. 63, &sect; 1(2)(c) of the Legislative Acts of Kentucky, the Kentucky Statute Revision Commission Publication p. 98, he already had notice of the rules.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the circuit court's decision and directed it to enter an order dismissing the contestant's petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was indicted, tried, and convicted for armed robbery. He did not file a copy of the judgment. The inmate alleged, inter alia, that his confinement was unlawful, that he had been deprived of his equal protection and due process rights, and that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 433.140, which prescribed the penalty for armed robbery, was unconstitutional. The court held that the trial court properly sustained the demurrer to the petition. Although the trial court's order sustaining the demurrer included both the statement of facts and the statement of law, it was proper; the petition did not show a right to the writ. The indictment was presumed to have been regularly and validly returned; the record did not show the circumstance under which the indictment of the inmate was found. The trial court implicitly ruled that &sect; 433.140 was constitutional in sustaining the demurrer to the petition. The court upheld the constitutionality of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 433.140. It did not adopt by reference the definition of the crime described in Ky. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners had operated a service station, restaurant, and tavern on the lot before the area was zoned as a residential district and were permitted to continue the nonconforming use of their buildings. The buildings were completely destroyed by a flood and the property owners made no effort to rebuild, believing that a clause in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 100.069 prohibited rebuilding. Later &sect; 100.069 was amended and the clause was eliminated. The zoning commission denied the property owners' permit to rebuild. The property owners maintained that they had a vested constitutional right to continue the nonconforming use of their property. On appeal, the commission argued that the property owners did not exhaust their administrative remedies. The court affirmed, holding that the property owners' rights were governed by the amendment, which lifted a bar that the legislature had placed in the way of the free enjoyment of a property right. There would have been no point in taking an appeal to the zoning commission's board of adjustment and appeals, because that board was not designed as a judicial body to pass on the legal question of the construction and validity of &sect; 100.069.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment, holding that the circuit court erred in finding that the insured's automobile never came into the custody of the hotel. After the insured registered as a guest and turned his keys over to the bellboy, his car was in the custody of the hotel. The hotel owed the insured at least the duty of a bailee for hire and was bound to use ordinary care in safeguarding his property. The hotel's duty was breached by the negligent conduct of its bellboy and room clerk. While the hotel was not an insurer against torts of its off-duty employee, neither would it be relieved from liability for negligence by the intervention of a wrongful act, the probability of which made its conduct negligent in the first place. Finally, the court held that the statutory limitation under Ky. Rev. Stat.

The applicants claimed that they were exempt from the quota regulation. They argued that they should have been considered as having had an application on file with the board from the time they first made known to the administrator that they desired a license. The applicants believed that because they filed an application with the administrator before July 21, 1950, the board could not lawfully pass a quota regulation applicable to them without violating the rule against retroactivity of regulations. The court found that an applicant could not be before the board until the administrator had acted. Thus, the order of the board was not in excess of its power or contrary to its regulations, and it was supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

Although appellant asserted that the issuance and sale of the bonds constituted a lending of the city's credit to the board in violation of Ky. Const. &sect; 179, the board was merely a means of carrying out a necessary governmental function for the city and county, and the city reaped the same benefits from the board's activities as it formerly reaped from its own efforts. No non-uniform taxation resulted. The county levied its tax upon all county properties for the support of the board.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 81.110(1) as mandatory. Furthermore, there was no right to appeal the judgment of the circuit court in annexation proceedings under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 81.190(4). The court, nonetheless, considered the landowners' argument that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 81.190 was unconstitutional. The court observed that the extension or reduction of the boundaries of a city or town was purely a political matter, entirely within the power of the legislature of the state to regulate. The state legislature had the unlimited right to pass such laws for the annexation of territory to municipal corporations as in its judgment would best accomplish the desired end.</SPAN></P>

Appellee, the Commonwealth, for the use and benefit of the city, opposed the agents' appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax imposed by the city on non-resident businesspersons was $ 200 per year or $ 10 per day, and the tax applied to the photography business. The non-resident agents came into the city and took orders for photographs, and the orders were sent to Tennessee for processing after half the purchase price was paid. Thereafter a second agent of the business returned to the city, accompanied by a cameraman, and pictures were taken in the city. On the second visit, the remainder of the purchase price was collected, and the pictures were sent to Tennessee, where they were developed. After that the pictures were sent back to the customer by way of mail from Tennessee. The trial court upheld the validity of the ordinance, and after sustaining the motions for an appeal made by the agents, the court reversed. The court held that the agents were engaged in interstate commerce and that U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, the commerce clause, was applicable. The court also ruled that imposing a license tax on persons who sold goods that were ordered in Kentucky but were to be delivered from outside of Kentucky was a violation of the commerce clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee held an amateur radio license, and he sought to obtain a license plate bearing his private radio call number pursuant to the provisions of H.B. 60, Gen. Assem., Reg. Sess. (Ky. 1952). The Commissioner of Revenue refused to issue the license plate, and the licensee filed an action to compel the Commissioner to issue the plate by mandamus. As a defense, the Commissioner claimed that H.B. 60 violated the Kentucky Constitution. The trial court sustained the licensee's demurrer to the defense, and granted a writ of mandamus. The Commissioner appealed and the court reversed the trial court's judgment. Contrary to the licensee's assertion, in a mandamus proceeding, the Commissioner could justify his refusal to act upon the ground that the law was unconstitutional if he was acting ministerially. H.B. 60 was not a valid exercise of police power because members of the class of persons with the amateur radio licenses as a group with special license plates would in no way assist law enforcement authorities. The assignment of amateur radio operators to a class apart from the remainder of automobile owners did not bear a reasonable relation to the purpose of the act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1952 Ky. Acts ch. 14 increased the salaries for county commissioners serving on fiscal courts. The legislation provided that commissioners in counties containing a first or second class city who were in office on its effective date and who were elected at the election where Ky. Const. &sect; 246 was amended were to receive the increased compensation. The county's fiscal court approved salary increases for the commissioners, effective May 1, 1952. The trial court enjoined the salary increases. On appeal, the court reversed that judgment with regard to the commissioner elected in 1949 and remanded the matter. The judgment was otherwise affirmed. The court stated that Ky. Const. &sect; 246, as amended at the November 1949 election, suspended the operation of Ky. Const. &sect; 161 and Ky. Const. &sect; 235 insofar as they prohibited salary increases to officers who were victorious at that election. Therefore, the commissioner elected at that time was entitled to the increase. In that regard, 1952 Ky. Acts ch. 14 simply reflected the intent of Ky. Const. &sect; 246. The commissioner's colleagues were not entitled to the increase because they were elected or re-elected in November 1951.</SPAN></P>

The Commission assessed taxes against the employer for several years. The employer paid the assessment under protest. The employer filed an action against the Commission challenging the assessment. The trial court upheld the Commission's determination. The employer appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court properly interpreted &sect; 341.070(1) to apply to the employer. The court explained that &sect; 341.070(1) did not require that the four employees be employed simultaneously to hold the employer responsible for payroll taxes.

With respect to occupations, the tax was one percent of the compensation earned for work done or services performed within the city. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the ordinance was valid. The trial court did not err in refusing to receive evidence and announcing an oral opinion before the case was placed on the trial docket. The powers delegated to the finance director by the ordinance were valid under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89.500 because the delegation was merely powers to prescribe administrative details. The regulatory fees were not unreasonable in relation to the cost of regulating the businesses and occupations concerned, and were not so oppressive as to amount to a prohibition of the activities involved.

The parties did not have adverse interests, and there was no controversy among them from the standpoint of one party asserting a right against another or claiming the existence of a duty owed to him by another party. Furthermore, the intervention by the employer did not create a controversy because the employer did not claim rights adverse to those asserted by the unions but merely contested, by demurrer, the right of the unions to maintain the proceeding.

However, he did not state that he was within the coverage of the ordinances proposed to be repealed or that he would in any way be directly or specially benefited by the adoption of the ordinance initiated. Therefore, plaintiff did not show legal capacity to maintain the action and the lower court should have sustained the special demurrer to the petition. Proceeding to the merits of the mandamus petition, the court further held that actions between contending parties regarding the expenditure of public funds, such as the underlying action, were maintainable in cases challenging the validity of a proposed amendment to the state constitutional. However, there was no right to obtain a vote of the people upon the enactment of legislation that would be invalid if approved by them.

The Commission complied with Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 324.170 by serving on the realtor a notice that was sufficiently explicit as to time, place, and allegation. The Commission had statutory authority under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 324.210 to refuse a realty license on the ground that its applicant was morally unfit to engage in the business. The realtor had no injunctive recourse available to her because she had adequate remedies at law. The realtor alleged insufficient facts to support her contention that the proceedings against her resulted from fraud and collusion amongst her competitors. Because the court decided the case on the pleadings alone, it refused to discuss the realtor's argument, not raised in the pleadings, that the Commission's action effected an unconstitutional impairment of contracts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board of commissioners passed a resolution removing the city manager. The next morning the city solicitor undertook to serve as acting city manager pursuant to a 1930 ordinance and a 1950 city ordinance. He appointed the claimant as police chief. Later that morning, the mayor signed the resolution removing the city manager. A new city manager was appointed who appointed appellee as police chief. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part the circuit court's judgment. Pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89.540, the resolution removing the city manager did not take effect until the mayor signed it. The court ignored the legal fiction that the law did not recognize fractions of a day because the priority of the parties' rights depended upon the order of events occurring on the same day. The court held that the acting city manager had no power to act when he appointed the claimant because the existing city manager had not been removed from office. The court reversed that portion of the judgment that found that the 1930 and 1950 ordinances were unconstitutional because the issues of the case did not require that finding.</SPAN></P>

According to the court, the property owners failed to show that the public health did not require them to discontinue their private methods and to connect with the public system. The court noted that while it seemed that properly operated private septic tanks could afford a sanitary disposal system, the publicly maintained sewage system of the whole community was undoubtedly better as doing away with potential as well as actual health menaces.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The incorporators of the city included the railroad's property within the boundaries of the proposed city. The evidence indicated that the railroad's property was not suited to any municipal use and that the property would not derive any benefit from electrical power, lighting, water, sewer, fire department, or police department services that might be established by the proposed city. The incorporators intended to subject the railroad to municipal taxes, and the railroad argued that the levy and collection of municipal taxes without any benefits to the railroad constituted an unconstitutional taking in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court reversed the trial court's judgment, finding that the incorporators could not include the railroad's property within the city's proposed boundaries if it was not adapted and could never be utilized for some municipal use. The court concluded that the laying or authorizing of a tax upon the railroad's property constituted a taking of private property without just compensation in violation of Ky.

Stat. &sect; 278.501, the trial court awarded a sum certain to the landowners. The landowners sought a reversal of the trial court's judgment on the ground that the statute under which the condemnation was authorized was unconstitutional. The landowners also contended that the instructions given by the trial court were erroneous and that the verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence. The court held that the gas company's right to condemnation was not unconstitutional because it did not deprive the landowners of their right to drill and produce oil or gas from their land, except to require that they were to case off a certain mineral should they drill. The landowners failed to preserve the issue of jury instructions for appeal in their motion for a new trial. The evidence amply sustained the trial court's verdict. The court found no evidence that the jury's award of damages was out of line as to show passion or prejudice or was unsupported by physical facts.</SPAN></P>

No question was raised on appeal as to the correctness of the judgment insofar as it validated the bonds. Rather, the real issue was the correctness of the portion of the judgment holding valid an ordinance authorizing the actual issuance and the sale of the bonds. Upon consideration, the court reversed. Appellee had previously been a city of the third class, but it had changed to a city of the second class. As a city of the third class, appellees' legislative power was vested in a unicameral common council. The legislative branch of the government of a city of the second class was bicameral, consisting of a board of aldermen and a board of councilmen. The vacancies of the new officers of appellee were not filled as they should have been, and thus the ordinance was invalid because it was not passed by the proper governing officers of appellee.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 342.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time the employee died from injuries sustained while on duty, the Department did not operate under the Workmen's Compensation Act. The General Assembly enacted Senate Resolution 47, 1950 Gen. Assem. (Ky. 1950), which authorized the Board to permit the widow to file her claim. On review, the court reversed, holding that the senate resolution was void because it violated Ky. Const. &sect; 59(29), which provided that the General Assembly could not pass local or special acts where a general law could be made applicable. The Board thus did not have jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter and its award was void and subject to collateral attack. It was obvious that the General Assembly had sought to do away with the necessity of requiring the widow to institute a suit to establish a claim against the Commonwealth, and the special resolution was in effect an admission that an agency of the Commonwealth was liable for damages to the widow. Unquestionably, the resolution could not be regarded otherwise than an attempt to cover a special case when a general law in existence was otherwise applicable within the meaning and spirit of Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth brought a petition against the owner of land and others to forfeit land based on their failure to list property for taxation and to pay taxes in compliance with the provisions of ch. 22 of Kentucky Statutes, relating to the assessment of old land grants. An appeal was taken, and judgment was affirmed. About 39 years later the owner filed a motion asking for an order of sale of land. The trial court overruled the motion on laches and statute of limitations grounds. The owner then brought a mandamus proceeding against the trial judge. He sought an order of sale, but the mandamus was refused as not being a proper remedy. On appeal, the court held that the failure of the owner to assert within a reasonable time his claim of right to have the unredeemed portions of the land sold and further proceedings taken under the judgment of forfeiture estopped him from doing so now. Despite the owner's claim that the Commonwealth would suffer no prejudice to grant mandamus, the court held that the Commonwealth would suffer prejudice because to grant the owner the requested relief would open up a &quot;Pandora's box&quot; by placing a cloud on title by sale of forfeited lands.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The general assembly approved 1950 Ky. Acts ch. 137. The legislation was to supercede Ky.

The circuit court found that 1950 Ky. Acts ch. 137 submitted two amendments, namely, the repeal of one provision and the adoption of another, in violation of Ky. Const. &sect; 256, and declared the legislation void. On appeal, the court reversed that judgment and remanded the matter. The court noted that a constitutional amendment, by implication, repealed the present provisions relating to the same subject. Therefore, the legislation did not submit two amendments to the voters, in violation of Ky. Const. &sect; 256. Moreover, the question that was to be submitted to the voters complied with Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 118.430 because it closely followed the proposed amendment and set forth its material parts. The court also found that the proposed amendment related to a single subject, i.e., amendments to the Kentucky Constitution, thereby complying with Ky. Const. &sect; 256.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed, holding that &sect; 160.630 was unconstitutional as it applied to the board's school. The provision wrongfully attempted to make the children's home a school district without using those particular words. The court explained that the board's school could not be a &quot;common school&quot; within the meaning in Ky. Const. &sect; 183 to &sect; 186 so as to quality it to receive money from the common school fund. The school could not constitutionally receive state aid because it was not operated by a regular school district. Therefore, appropriations were not allowed to the school.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth brought an action against the dentist in order to enjoin him from the practice of dentistry without a license. On a prior appeal, the court recommended that the Board be made a party to the action. On remand, the Board intervened as plaintiff. The trial court permanently enjoined the dentist from the practice of dentistry in the state unless and until he had been issued a license from the Board. The dentist was also enjoined from maintaining a dental office or advertising as a dentist. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court determined that 1946 Ky. Acts 254, which directed the Board to issue the dentist a license, was unconstitutional because it was special legislation. The court found that the dentist was not entitled to a license under the provisions of Ky. Stat. &sect; 2641 (1909) because the evidence did not establish that the dentist ever received a diploma. The evidence was such that the trial court would have been justified in granting the dentist equitable relief or in denying it.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that it was error to have dismissed his writ for habeas corpus relief. He claimed that he had been denied due process because the judge did not issue the writ directing the prison warden to take him before a court and have heard evidence upon the merits of the grounds alleged as a right to have him released from custody. The court determined that the indictment was defective with respect to charging defendant with being a habitual criminal and also because if failed to authorize the instructions under which he was given a life sentence. However, the court noted that the failure was only irregularities or errors which at most rendered the judgment erroneous but not void. These errors were available on the appeal of defendant from the judgment of conviction and were not pointed out or relied upon then. Thus, the court concluded that they were unavailable to defendant now because it had to be deemed that defendant had waived them where he failed to raise the issues on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The minority preferred stockholders voted against consolidation, claiming that the plan destroyed valuable rights of the preferred stockholders, most significantly the extinguishment of dividend arrearages, and at their expense greatly favored the common stock. The preferred stockholders filed a petition to enjoin the consolidation. The trial court dismissed the petition. The court affirmed, determining that the consolidation was not an unconstitutional impairment of the preferred stockholders' contract rights where they did not have a vested right to be paid dividend arrearages. Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 271.475 plainly contemplated a readjustment of stock rights upon a consolidation because a dissatisfied stockholder had the right to demand the fair market value of his shares under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 271.490(1). The plan proposed conformed to the provisions of the consolidation statute. The consolidation plan was fair where the preferred stockholders were to immediately receive a substantial payment per share and the plan was to permit the resumption of preferred dividend payments not otherwise possible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver struck and killed a pedestrian. Pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 187.330(1) the Department of Revenue told the driver that he had to either pay a sum of money, provide evidence of his financial responsibility, or surrender his license to operate a motor vehicle. The driver failed to comply with the department's request and his license was suspended. The driver challenged that decision. He maintained that &sect; 187.300 was unconstitutional because it did not provide him with a hearing or judicial review and because it deprived him of his property without due process of law. The trial court found that &sect; 187.300 was constitutional and awarded judgment to the department. That decision was affirmed by the court. Operation of a motor vehicle was a privilege, not a right, and was subject to reasonable regulation. The legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky could require the procurement of insurance or the furnishing of some proof of financial responsibility in order to operate a vehicle. Proof of financial responsibility was a safety precaution unrelated to negligence. Suspension of a mere privilege did not implicate due process.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment of the trial court because the city did not show that any engineer had surveyed the street, or that the city had, by any ordinance, established the grade of the street or the grade of adjacent streets. It was obvious to the court that the grade and other specific specifications, not only as to the grade of the street but as to the width of the street, should have been established and pleaded and proved in the action. In addition, no action had been taken under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 94.360(2) to close the street.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town sought pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 81.040 et seq., to incorporate into its boundaries the rail yards of the railroad corporation. The railroad opposed that action, claiming that it was a blatant move to simply have the railroad pay the majority of the town's taxes and thus was an unconstitutional attempt to take the railroad's property in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and Ky. Const. &sect; 2. The circuit court approved the action, but delayed entry of the judgment for the railroad to obtain a writ of prohibition if it could. The court held that under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 81.060, there was no appeal of the circuit court's decision to incorporate the rail yards, except where there was a question as to the constitutionality of the act itself. The court found that the circuit court had not violated any aspect of the statutes, so the only grounds for relief for the railroad was on the issue of the act's constitutionality. But because there was available to the railroad a direct appeal in law as to the issue of the act's constitutionality, a writ of prohibition was not an appropriate remedy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant minister challenged a decision from the Christian Circuit Court (Kentucky), which revoked his license to perform marriage ceremonies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minister was licensed to perform marriages. He was convicted of soliciting marriages, in violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 402.090(3). The minister contended that it was his religious duty to solicit marriages because ceremonies performed by public officials were not recognized. After his conviction, the minister's license was revoked. In affirming, the court determined that the minister's conduct clearly violated &sect; 402.090(3). The minister alleged that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 402.060, which provided for annulment of the license after notice to the holder, was unconstitutional because it violated Ky. Const. &sect; 2. The court determined that &sect; 402.060 was not arbitrary simply because it provided for the cancellation of the minister's license. Moreover, it was not unconstitutionally applied to the minister because he was provided with due process of law. Moreover, Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 402.090(3) was not unconstitutional because the restraint on marriage ceremonies was reasonable. The court noted that the minister's right to free speech was not curtailed because he was still able to promulgate his religious views.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, bondholders and a taxpayer, sought review from a judgment of a Kentucky trial court sustaining the general demurrer of appellee state officials to the taxpayer's suit against the state officials and declaring the rights as between the state officials and the bondholders. The taxpayer attacked the bond sale under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56 (Supp. 1950).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer argued that the proposed plan for the bond sale was unconstitutional and that the legislative enactment under which it was based was also unconstitutional. The state officials made up the relevant administrative agency embarking on the bond sale. The court found that: (1) although the taxpayer might not have the required interest for the constitutional challenge, the bondholders did have the requisite interest to demand resolution of the matter; (2) the state officials were not acting arbitrarily without applicable rules governing their behavior and the relevant statute restricted the manner of issuing and selling the bonds; (3) the argument that the statute violated the Kentucky Constitution &sect; 51 for failure to express the subject in its title and to relate entirely to that single subject was meritless because there was no inconsistency between the many provisions and the nature of the statute; and (4) the failure of the state officials to enter into a trust indenture securing the bonds and for the construction, operation, and leasing of the building was not improper where the state had not been required to enter into the trust indenture under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment sustaining the general demurrer and declaring the rights of the bondholders and the state officials.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, taxpayers, sought review of the judgment of the lower court (Kentucky), which approved the plan and contracts by which the board of education and the fiscal county court proposed to erect a high school building and to issue bonds, in favor of appellees, the board of education and three brokerage concerns.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court approved the plan and contracts for the erection of a high school building. The taxpayers argued that the lease provisions of the contract between the board and the fiscal court were unilateral and unenforceable, and the provisions of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 162.140, which authorized the contract were unconstitutional since such authority was in itself a violation of the law of contracts requiring mutuality. They also argued that the scheme and plan was so detrimental to the public interest as to be an abuse of administrative discretion. The court affirmed. The contract was bilateral in so far as it covered the first year. As the annual periods are reached, both parties would need to continue the lease and make it valid and binding by ratification year by year. But whether or not that be done was at present no concern of the courts. As to the argument that the plan was so detrimental to the public interest as to be an abuse of administrative discretion, the lower court properly regarded the financing as a matter of reasonable administrative discretion rather than proof of arbitrary action or abuse of discretion that would justify judicial interference.</SPAN></P>
