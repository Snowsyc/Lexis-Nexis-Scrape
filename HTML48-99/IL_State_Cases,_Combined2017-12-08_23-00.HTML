<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Village of Long Grove (Long Grove) sought review of an order by the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois), which granted plaintiff Village of Buffalo Grove's (Buffalo Grove) motion for summary judgment on Buffalo Grove's complaint in quo warranto, denied Long Grove's motion for summary judgment, and denied Buffalo Grove's motion for sanctions against Long Grove pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2 -- 611 (1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Long Grove contended that the Buffalo Grove annexation was invalid and that Buffalo Grove was barred under the doctrine of laches. The court affirmed the grant of Buffalo Grove's motion for summary judgment and held (1) that Long Grove's argument that Buffalo Grove never actually passed the annexation ordinance in its present version was without merit; (2) that the omission of the adjacent portion of Route 83 from the legal description in the notice to be insignificant and it did not invalidate the annexation; (3) that the failure of Buffalo Grove to file a certified copy of its annexation ordinance and a map of the annexed territory with the Cook County recorder of deeds within 90 days did not invalidate the annexation; and (4) that Buffalo Grove diligently asserted its rights at all times during the instant proceedings and the doctrine of laches was clearly inapplicable. The court reversed the denial of Buffalo Grove's motion for sanctions because the trial court abused its discretion by determining that Long Grove did not violate Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2 -- 611 (1987) by advancing the argument that an annexation plaintiff might have abandoned annexation proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order granting plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, reversed the order denying plaintiff's motion for sanctions, and remanded the cause to the trial court for determination of an appropriate sanction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted him of residential burglary, sentenced him to a term of four years' imprisonment to run consecutive to an eight-year prison term imposed upon defendant two days earlier, and convicted his co-defendants of theft. Defendant asserted, among other things, that he was deprived of the right to effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was arrested for burglary and advised of his Miranda rights, he informed the police that he had broken in the residence with some other people after borrowing a van. Defendant identified his codefendants. At trial, defendant testified on direct examination that he had participated in the burglary of the residence. He stated that he went into the home and took the property outside, put it in the van, and left. His codefendants did not testify at trial. The trial court found defendant guilty of residential burglary and found his codefendants guilty of theft. The trial court stated that prior to defendant's testimony, it anticipated finding defendant guilty of theft, but because defendant admitted that he committed the residential burglary, the trial court had no choice but to convict him. The court reversed the conviction and remanded for a new trial, holding that there was no logical reason for counsel to have called defendant as a witness and to have elicited a confession on direct examination. Further, the court stated that defense counsel's conduct amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel because it nullified the adversarial quality of the trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) which, following a jury trial, convicted defendant of two counts of home invasion, a violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-11 (1985), two counts of armed robbery, a violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 18-2(a) (1985), and two counts of unlawful restraint, a violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 10-3(a) (1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts each of home invasion, armed robbery, and unlawful restraint. Defendant was also determined to be a habitual criminal under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 33B-1 et seq. (1985) (act). Defendant contended that: the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the testimony of an alibi witness as a sanction for defendant's violation of the discovery rules; vacation of one of defendant's home invasion convictions was proper because defendant committed only one illegal entry; and (3) defendant's previous conviction under a federal armed bank robbery statute did not constitute a prior offense for purposes of the habitual criminal statute. The court held that the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant's alibi defense where there was no indication that defendant wilfully violated discovery rules but that the denial of defendant's alibi defense was harmless error. The court, however, determined that one of defendant's home invasion convictions must have been vacated, as defendant only entered one home. The court also concluded that the federal conviction for armed robbery constituted a prior offense for purposes of the act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for home invasion, armed robbery, and unlawful restraint with the exception of one of the convictions for home invasion which was vacated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Vermilion County (Illinois), which convicted him of aggravated criminal sexual assault, residential burglary, and unlawful restraint, in violation of Ill.

The court held that a statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition was admissible as a hearsay exception. The court held that the trial court determination that the three-year-old declarant's statement was reliable and within the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule was not an abuse of discretion. The court held that the additional time between the event and the declarant's statement was not as important under the circumstances because the stress of a sexual assault upon a child remained with the child long after the assault occurred and that the child's statement was very unlikely to have been fabricated. The court affirmed a judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court's orders. The court held that defendant accepted the jurors alleged to have been tainted by the excused juror's statement, that defendant waived any objection to the jurors, that defendant waived his objection to a jury instruction by failing to tender another instruction, and that defendant failed to establish that his submission to the blood-alcohol test was coerced. The court held, however, that there was no agreement between defendant and the city to assess attorney's fees, that there was no statute authorizing the award of fees, that the city's ordinance was not a statute, and that the trial court lacked authority to award attorney's fees to the city.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the order that certified defendant as a habitual child sex offender. The registration requirement did not violate the Eighth Amendment. There was nothing about the registration requirement that failed to comport with humane justice. Furthermore, the registration requirement was not disproportionate to the offense. The registration requirement did not violate defendant's right to equal protection. Because the classification challenged did not affect a fundamental right or discriminate against a suspect class, the proper standard for judging the statute was the rational basis test. The registration requirement had a legitimate purpose. Requiring habitual child sex offenders to register with local police authorities allowed the authorities to keep abreast of potential threats to the children of a community that might be posed by the presence of a habitual child sex offender. The registration requirement did not deny defendant due process because no fundamental right was involved, the legislature had a legitimate purpose in passing the Act, and the Act rationally served that purpose.</SPAN></P>

She was discharged after she was seen spanking her own children due to concerns of the parents of other children. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment for the employee. There were no provisions in either the Child Care Act of 1969 (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23, para. 2211 et seq. (1985), or the Department of Children and Family Services regulations governing day care facilities that provided a private cause of action for wrongful disclosure of information contained in an employee's personnel file. The harm the employee allegedly suffered, injury to her reputation, did not arise from any hazard the Act was designed to eliminate. While the employee was the mother of two of the children in the facility's care, her invasion of privacy action was based on her status as an employee, and the private fact disclosed was the disciplinary action taken against her for violating the facility's rules and regulations banning corporal punishment. However, the court affirmed the directed verdict for the employer and its executive director on the punitive damages claim. There was no evidence of malice or wanton disregard for the employee's privacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consumer asserted, inter alia, that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the issue of res ipsa loquitur, that the closing argument of the manufacturer's counsel was improper and prejudicial, and that the trial court erred in denying the consumer's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court reasoned that it would have been improper to have instructed the jury on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur because the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the manufacturer eliminated the res ipsa loquitur issue from the case; therefore, no such issue remained before the jury. The court concluded that the reconstruction of the accident by the manufacturer's counsel during closing argument was proper because it was based on evidence in the record. The court further concluded that the consumer's failure to object at trial to the manufacturer's counsel's reference to him as the one honest person connected with the prosecution of the lawsuit waived the claimed error. The court found no basis in the record to set aside the jury's verdict and enter judgment notwithstanding the verdict for the consumer.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed and reversed the order of certification. The act listed four sexual offenses that could be used as predicates to certification as a habitual child sex offender. Three of those four were always felonies. One, criminal sexual abuse, could be either a misdemeanor or a felony. The court construed language in the Act to require that certification could only be made based on prior felony convictions. One of the convictions used in defendant's case was a conviction for contributing to the sexual delinquency of a child. The crime no longer existed as such but in defendant's case it had been charged as a misdemeanor similar to the charge of criminal sexual abuse. As a misdemeanor it could not be the basis of defendant's certification and therefore reversal of the order of certification was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A racetrack suspended the horse trainer for one year following a positive drug test on one of his horses. The trainer appealed to the state racing commission, but before a hearing could be held, he filed a complaint in the trial court seeking a preliminary injunction barring the suspension until the board made its ruling. The trainer alleged that his prehearing suspension was unconstitutional and that he would suffer irreparable harm if the prehearing suspension were not restrained.

Venue was proper in another county, pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2-103 (1987), because the board had its principal office in the other county.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the order of the Circuit Court of Peoria County (Illinois) convicting him of bringing contraband into a state penal institution in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 31A-1.1a (1987) and sentencing him. Based on &sect; 5-8-4(h) of the Unified Code of Corrections, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-4(h) (1987), defendant was ordered to serve his sentence consecutive to a sentence entered on an earlier conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant was on pre-trial release on a charge of unlawful possession of cannabis with intent to deliver, he went to the state penal institution to deliver a message to one of the inmates. A correctional officer searched defendant and found cannabis on him. Defendant was convicted for bringing contraband into a state penal institution, and the trial court ordered his sentence to run consecutive with his sentence on an earlier conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that defendant's contention that his conviction should have been reduced to an attempt because he did not introduce cannabis into the institution was without merit. The area where the search took place was an entrance area, and defendant would have had no other reason for being there other than to enter the institution. Therefore, defendant was within the institution at the time the cannabis was discovered. The court further held that &sect; 1005-8-4(h) did not violate due process or the separation of powers doctrine. The purpose of &sect; 1005-8-4(h) was to remedy the threat posed by persons who committed crimes while on bond and it did not unduly infringe on judicial sentencing authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the defendant's conviction for bringing contraband into a state penal institution and his sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of armed violence and subsequently pleaded guilty to second-degree murder after the jury failed to reach a verdict on three murder counts. Defendant argued that he was denied a fair trial because the court gave a non-Illinois Pattern Jury Instructions (IPI) instruction on armed violence, because of the definition of force given, and because no definitional instruction on battery was given. The court affirmed, finding that defendant waived review of the armed violence instruction because he did not object to it as a non-IPI instruction and did not offer an IPI instruction, that defendant waived review of the definitional instruction on force because he stated he had no objection after modification by the prosecutor, and that there was no plain error in the lack of an definitional instruction on battery because the jury could have understood the meaning of battery. The court found that admission of the deposition testimony did not violate defendant's right to a face-to-face confrontation with the expert because the witness was unavailable, the deposition was taken under oath, and the witness was subject to cross-examination by defense counsel.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the trial court had jurisdiction because the father filed a timely petition for sanctions under 2-611. The court upheld the constitutionality of 2-611. The court found clear evidence that the mother was attempting to harass the father; therefore, the evidence was sufficient to support the sanctions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guardian's sister sustained injuries during surgery. The guardian filed a medical malpractice action against the doctor on his sister's behalf.

The lower court granted the guardian's oral motion for sanctions against the doctor finding that the information obtained from the nurse was privileged. The lower court further found the attorney in contempt of court. On appeal, the court vacated the finding of contempt. The court vacated the finding because the actions taken by the attorney occurred prior to case law, which advanced the public policies of confidentiality in the doctor-patient relationship by the regulated and supervised discovery process rather than unregulated, open-ended, and surreptitious ex parte contacts. The court held that although the lower court's interpretation of the case law was correct, the delineation of prohibited conduct was not sufficiently clear to justify imposition of criminal contempt.</SPAN></P>

Sup. Ct. R. 183 and that the father and child failed to present any evidence of good cause for the untimely filing. The court further determined that the health professional's report was deficient in that it stated merely that the doctor and hospital's agents took inappropriate action but did not discuss what these actions were and that an amended report was still deficient in that it did not identify the deficiencies in medical care given by each defendant.</SPAN></P>

At a bench trial, defendant and the state stipulated to a set of facts that would support a conviction. The trial court found defendant guilty and pronounced sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed. Although the evidence was insufficient to prove venue, defense counsel's agreement that the parties' stipulation to a set of facts supporting defendant's conviction showed an intent on defendant's behalf to agree that the offense occurred within the county. The court found that Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 402 admonishments were not required where defendant preserved any error in the court's ruling on his motion to suppress prior to his stipulated trial. The court held that sufficient evidence existed for the police to conduct their &quot;Terry- type&quot; stop of defendant's car.

The court reversed those judgments and held that the ordinance exceeded the exercise of home rule authority under Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6(a). Applying the three-prong test to determine the validity of an exercise of home rule authority, the court held that regulation of railroad operations, including the specific conduct involved here, was traditionally placed outside the scope of municipal power. The court noted that enforcement provisions of the state obstructions statute vested exclusive authority in the commerce commission to prosecute violations.</SPAN></P>

At issue was the taxpayer's partnership return for a certain year. The department disallowed a claimed modification under the mathematical error provision of the Illinois Income Tax Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 15-1501(a)(12) (1979). The taxpayer sought to dismiss the instant action as being time barred, because the action was initiated well beyond the three-year limitations period. The department countered that because the defect in the tax return was a mathematical error, the statutory limitation period for deficiency assessments was inapplicable. The trial court dismissed the action and the department appealed. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the decision, holding that &sect; 1501(a)(12)(D) of the Act applied to the instant case, thereby allowing the department to send a correction notice rather than a notice of deficiency.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the hospital and its attorney asserted that the requests violated the Medical Studies Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 8-2101 et. seq. (1987), the physician-patient privilege of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 8-802 (1987), the attorney-client privilege, and the work product privilege. The court held that the hospital should have supported its privilege claim by either submitting all of the documents for in camera inspection or by submitting an affidavit. The hospital also should have produced any nonprivileged materials encompassed by the request. However, some of the documents that were submitted for in camera inspection were privileged under the Medical Studies Act, and the trial court erred in ordering them disclosed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Vermilion County (Illinois) that convicted him after a bench trial of unlawful possession of marijuana. The marijuana was discovered in a bag in defendant's truck during a warrantless search by a conservation officer pursuant to &sect; 1.19 of the Wildlife Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 61, para. 1.19 (1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the first weekend of hunting season, the conservation officer was checking hunters' trucks for illegal game when he saw an opaque bag in the cab of defendant's truck of a type that in his experience hunters often used to conceal illegal game. He looked inside it and discovered marijuana. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the marijuana, holding that the stop was administrative in nature. The court affirmed the conviction. The search was not administrative, but it was authorized. Reason to believe that the bag contained illegal game within the meaning of &sect; 1.19 of the Code arose from indicia that defendant was a hunter or had very recently engaged in hunting. Because hunting was licensed and heavily regulated, and because wildlife licensing and regulatory provisions had to be enforceable during hunting and immediately following it, the court concluded that hunting or obtaining a license to hunt constituted implied consent to limited searches. Defendant had the indicia of a hunter and the conservation officer's search was authorized.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 127, para. 1001 et seq. (1987). On appeal of the trial court's denial of the trucking company's request for a preliminary injunction, the court affirmed and ruled that the trucking company did not establish its right to injunctive relief. The court found that the trucking company did not establish any right or interest which needed protection because the record showed that the auditors did not use the WRQ in their audit and the record did not support the trucking company's contention that the standards in the WRQ would be used in an administrative hearing to its detriment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of armed violence, unlawful delivery of cocaine, unlawful possession with the intent to deliver cocaine, and unlawful possession with the intent to deliver cannabis. Defendant filed a motion to suppress, contending that the failure of the police to knock and announce prior to executing the search warrant rendered the search unreasonable. The court reversed the circuit court's order denying defendant's motion to suppress the evidence discovered in his house, and reversed and remanded from a new trial on the unlawful possession with intent to deliver and unlawful delivery convictions. The court held that the circuit court erred in finding exigent circumstances sufficient to excuse the officers' failure to knock and announce. The court found that the mere existence of cocaine in the house, the statements that there were weapons in the house to protect the drugs, and the fact that defendant had been arrested possessing a loaded weapon two years before, did not constitute exigent circumstances. The court reversed the armed violence conviction since defendant was found in the kitchen of the house, and all the loaded weapons were located on the second floor.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court rejected defendant's claim that the sentencing scheme of &sect; 32--10 punished the failure of a defendant to appear in court more severely than it did more serious crimes. The court held the sentencing scheme of &sect; 32--10 did not violate the due process guarantees of the United States and Illinois Constitutions since deterrence for jumping bail calls for a great penalty. The court held that the imposition of sentence on the next lower class felony of the underlying Class X felony was valid since the defendant's bail was given in connection with charges of both a Class X and a Class 1 felony. The court found no error in directing the $ 2,000 bond posted to be applied to the fine against defendant since he waived consideration of the alleged deficiency of the presentence investigation report by not raising the issue at trial. The court concluded that defendant was entitled to a $ 100 credit toward his fine because he spent 20 days in jail prior to his release on bond.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the Act was unconstitutional and that the State failed to prove the reptiles were &quot;life threatening&quot; beyond a reasonable doubt. The court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the case. The court held that the term &quot;life threatening&quot; as contained in the Act failed to meet constitutional muster since the legislature's failure to define the term effectively precluded a person of ordinary intelligence from knowing whether his reptiles were prohibited under the Act. The statutory language under which defendant was charged failed to draw reasonably clear lines between the types of reptiles that may be harbored without criminal repercussion. The statute was also constitutionally deficient because the term &quot;life threatening&quot; permitted arbitrary enforcement and application of the Act and the legislature thus accorded law enforcement officials unfettered latitude in enforcing the Act.</SPAN></P>

The second defendant argued that since the state never demonstrated he owned, used, or held the screwdriver, the possession element of the offense was missing. The court affirmed defendants' convictions. The court held that (1) there was no error in the first defendant's conviction and sentence for possession of burglary tools because his conduct in carrying the screwdriver away from the victim's property constituted identifiable separate conduct sufficient for a separate conviction, and (2) the second defendant's possession of burglary tools conviction was justified because he aided and abetted the first defendant in attempting to burglarize the residence and in transporting the first defendant and the screwdriver in his car.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff executor/trustee filed an action claiming that defendant California resident borrowed money from a trust and the decedent, which was evidenced by promissory notes, and sought to use defendant's inherited portion of the trust, located in a Chicago bank, to satisfy the debt. Plaintiff effected service by publication and obtained a default judgment. Defendant filed a special and limited appearance and moved to quash service of summons and vacate the default on the grounds that the trial court lacked jurisdiction. The trial court denied the motion to quash. On appeal, the court held that there was no personal service as required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110. para. 2--208(b), so the trial court lacked jurisdiction. The court rejected plaintiff's characterization of the action as an in rem proceeding because the trust account was not brought under the court's control until after the entry of the default judgment. The court also held that the trial court did not acquire in personam jurisdiction under the long-arm statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2--209(b), as mere execution of promissory notes within Illinois was not a sufficient &quot;transaction of business.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The circuit court entered an order nunc pro tunc directing the secretary to issue a restricted driving permit (RDP) to defendant for the purpose of attending counseling and work. The secretary argued that the trial court exceeded its authority by ordering him to issue a RDP to defendant. On appeal, the court vacated the order. The court held that the plain statutory language of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 6 -- 212 (1987) placed the ultimate decision of issuing a RDP within the scope of the secretary's discretion, subject only to judicial review by a circuit court after the secretary rendered its final administrative decision. The court found that the circuit court ordered the secretary to perform not merely ministerial duties, but to exercise its powers of discretion. The court held that in substituting its discretion for that of the secretary by ordering the issuance of a RDP, the trial court violated the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Educational unions (unions) were collecting &quot;fair-share&quot; payments from nonunion payors, who complained to the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board (IELRB). Payors from Alton asked the attorney for the other payors to represent them, which he did, but then their claims were adjudicated with the others. The IELRB held that some fees were not payable due to lack of notice, but otherwise payors must pay a proportional share. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that payors were given sufficient information about fair-share fees to decide whether to object. Failure to provide local union expenditures was not unconstitutional. The Alton payors were entitled to their own hearings instead of being bound by the results of the consolidated hearings, but the evidence from the prior hearings could be used there. The estimated amounts withheld by the unions were not excessive. There was nothing unconstitutional in forcing payors to pay fees to the parent Illinois and national unions. The fair-share fee calculation was correct, as was the presumption that fees inherently related to collective bargaining were chargeable, and how such fees were calculated.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion. Defendant appealed. On appeal, defendant argued that the statute differentiated between persons on the basis of the date of prior conviction or supervision regardless of the date of the commission of the prior DUI offense. However, the court held that the statutory scheme treated everyone the same because no one was eligible for a judicial driving permit or supervision for a period of five years from the date of conviction or from the date an order of supervision was imposed for DUI. Further, the court held that the statutory scheme was reasonable and related to its legislative purpose. Therefore, the court held that because defendant failed to maintain his burden to show that the statutory scheme invidiously discriminated against a class of persons, Ill. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The County and the sheriff initiated a declaratory judgment action against the union and the employees seeking a delineation of the exclusive bargaining rights and responsibilities and a determination that the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act, Ill.

The court determined that the Act provided a comprehensive system of collective bargaining for public employees and employers who fell within the Act's scope. The court found, however, that the Act was inapplicable because it did not address disputes between co-employers. The court held that the Act made it an unfair labor practice for an employer to refuse to bargain collectively in good faith.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois), which sentenced him, consecutively, to 60 years of imprisonment for attempted first degree murder under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 8-4 (1987), 30 years imprisonment for armed robbery under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1(a)(1) (1987), and 15 years imprisonment for attempted armed robbery under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 18-2(a) (1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's sentencing hearing, the trial judge determined that defendant's actions were extremely heinous and indicative of wanton cruelty. Defendant was given an extended term sentence under the Unified Code of Corrections, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-5-2(a), 1005-5-3.2(b)(2) (1987). On appeal, the state conceded that the sentencing order was improperly vague and that defendant was entitled to credit towards his sentences for time spent in custody prior to sentencing. The court agreed with the state that the sentencing order had not entitled defendant to a new sentencing hearing. Defendant, however, was entitled to a remand for the purpose entering of a proper sentencing order. The court rejected defendant's assertions that his actions in wounding a police officer were not heinous or wantonly cruel. The fact that defendant was trying to escape was not a factor mitigating against a finding of cruelty. The court affirmed the application of the extended-term in view of the judge's determination that defendant demonstrated a degree of premeditation, a total lack of remorse, and indifference to the lives of others. The application of the extended term was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded for the entry of an order reimposing defendant's sentences with greater specificity and issuing credit to defendant for time served prior to sentencing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested, charged with controlled substance violations, and released on bail. The trial was delayed for more than a year after the arrest.

The attorney replied that defendant did not ask for a speedy trial demand under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 103-5(b) (1987). Defendant obtained several continuances. Defendant fled the state and was later taken into custody. The court affirmed that part of the trial court's judgment that convicted defendant of two counts of delivery of a controlled substance. The court vacated that part of the trial court's judgment that imposed a fine because defendant was entitled, under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 110-14 (1987), to credit for each day incarcerated. The decision to demand a speedy trial was a strategic matter left for counsel, and defendant failed to instruct his attorney to demand a speedy trial; thus, defendant failed to show that his counsel's actions fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. Also, defendant waived the ineffective assistance of counsel issue for review.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the prosecutor's failure to prepare his witness properly so as to avoid any mention of excluded evidence was not intended to goad defendant into moving for a mistrial. The court held that defendant's retrial was not barred by double jeopardy. The court ruled that the statute that proscribed driving while under the influence of alcohol was a rational means to achieve a permissible legislative purpose, curbing the incidence of drunk drivers on Illinois' highways. The court held that because there appeared to be substantial scientific evidence to support the usefulness of the 2,100:1 ratio embodied in the challenged statutory sections, the sections were reasonably related to their underlying purpose of reducing drunk driving and thus were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action brought by appellant daughter against appellee trustee in which the daughter, who was allegedly fathered by decedent out of wedlock, sought to construe decedent's trust to include her as a &quot;child&quot; as specified in decedent's will, the Circuit Court of Winnebago County (Illinois) granted the trustee's motion for summary judgment based on a failure to timely file the claim. The daughter appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The name of the daughter was not included in this definition of the decedent's &quot;children&quot; under decedent's will, and the children were named as beneficiaries of decedent's trust. The daughter, who claimed to have been born to decedent out of wedlock, brought the current action accordingly to construe the testamentary trust but the trial court granted the trustee summary judgment because it found the daughter's action time barred under the two year limitation period set forth in the Illinois Parentage Act of 1984 (the Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 2508 (1987). Because the action was not brought within 2 years of the daughter's reaching the age 18, it was time barred. On appeal, the court reversed and found that interpretation of the Act impermissible because, in a case such as the present case, the daughter could not have been aware within 2 years of her 18th birthday that the trustee would later disavow her. The more reasonable interpretation, the court found, was that the limitation period did not begin to expire until the daughter knew or should have known that the trustee disavowed her. The case was remanded accordingly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court ruling and remanded the action because the statute of limitations should not have been deemed to expire until the daughter knew that the trustee disavowed her.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-13-14 (1987).On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the requirement of service was mandatory, not directory as urged by the neighboring landowners. The court reasoned that the word &quot;shall&quot; in a statute generally indicated a mandatory obligation, unless the context in which it appears indicated otherwise, and that since the language imposing the service requirement upon protesting petitioners was added in an amendment, the service requirement was mandatory otherwise it would render the amendment meaningless.

Defendant contended that the trial court erred in its admission of evidence concerning his prior convictions for driving with license revoked and for driving while under the influence of alcohol, and using jury instructions incorporating the information. The court rejected the argument because the elements of the enhanced offense for multiple violations required the jury to consider the prior convictions, and defendant waived his right to complain about the instructions because he failed to tender his own instruction at trial. The court also rejected defendant's double jeopardy and equal protection claims because driving under the influence was not a lesser included offense of driving with license revoked, and the legislature had a rational basis for &sect; 6-303(d).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff outdoor advertising corporation sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which granted defendant village's motion to strike and dismiss the corporation's amended complaint. The village's motion was brought pursuant to Ill. Code Civ. P., Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2 -- 615 (1987) and alleged the amended complaint was substantially insufficient at law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to the village's denial of permits to the advertising company to construct double-faced advertising billboards, based on various ordinance violations, the advertising company filed suit. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the action. Although the advertising company had contended that the village's local regulation of the location or size of outdoor advertising signs such as those which the advertising corporation proposed to construct was preempted by the Highway Advertising Control Act of 1971, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121, para. 501 et seq. (1987) (Act), the court held otherwise. The court ruled that a statute intended to limit or deny home rule powers was required to contain an express statement to that effect, and because the Act failed to contain such a statement, the trial court properly determined that the Act did not preempt the village's more restrictive sign regulatory ordinance. The court further determined that the amended complaint made conclusory allegations without factual basis and that the advertising corporation failed to exhaust its administrative remedies before it filed suit.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that he had proven his insanity by a preponderance of the evidence, that his sentence was excessive, and that the trial court had committed numerous reversible errors. The court reduced defendant's sentence because his actions did not compare to a calculated, premeditated murderer and his age and mild mental retardation were not given adequate weight in considering his rehabilitative potential. The court affirmed the judgment as modified because the jury's finding that defendant was legally sane at the time of the offense was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The trial court properly conducted a fitness hearing in determining that defendant was fit to stand trial and properly refused to ask the jurors about their attitudes toward mental retardation during voir dire. An allegedly inflammatory remark made by the prosecution was not so prejudicial as to warrant a new trial and the guilty but mentally ill verdict form was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The act created metropolitan airport authorities in counties with certain population restrictions. The Act also authorized the authorities to levy airport taxes and issue general obligation bonds.

On appeal, the court affirmed holding that the Act was not special legislation and did not violate the equal protection clause of the Illinois constitution. The court held that the cities failed to prove that the Act was enacted only for reasons totally unrelated to the pursuit of a legitimate state goal. The court reasoned that the legislature had frequently used population and location classifications to focus legislation on specific problems, and while the desire to improve airports without the necessity of the federal grants may not have been the best or most reasonable solution to the problem, it was not palpably arbitrary. The court also found that the cities could not argue the vagueness of the Act on appeal because the issue was not raised at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's contention was that Boone County's petit jury selection system, which drew potential jurors from the voter registration list, resulted in an underrepresentation of Hispanics, which thereby deprived him of his right to a jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community and his right to equal protection under the law. The State conceded that defendant met the first element of his prima facie case, as Hispanics had been recognized to be a distinctive group in the community. The reliability of an expert's statistical probability calculations was questionable, as they were based on seven year old figures. Moreover, the statistical probability of having either one or two Hispanics seated on a jury was flawed because such statistical probability presupposed randomness, whereas there were any number of proper reasons why some veniremen would not be chosen as petit jurors considering dismissals for cause and peremptory challenges. Defendant's evidence of underrepresentation was unreliable and insufficient to establish the second element of his prima facie case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot her husband, and presented an insanity defense. The court stated that because the jury had been informed during voir dire that the State had the burden of proving the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, it was not prejudicial to defendant to inform the jurors that defendant had the burden of proving insanity by a preponderance of the evidence. Any prejudice created by prosecution comment was cured by defendant's timely objection and the trial court's instruction to disregard the comment. During jury instructions, the trial court properly instructed the jury concerning the burden of proof and the definition of a preponderance of the evidence. Notwithstanding defendant's insanity defense and obligation to prove that defense by a preponderance of the evidence, the State was not relieved of first proving defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, because the State bore the primary burden of proof, the trial court properly allowed the State to open and close final arguments.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to his conviction of murder and armed robbery, defendant appealed. First defendant argued that he was denied a fair trial because the trial court allowed an investigator to testify to prior consistent statements that a co-conspirator made. Defendant further contended that any motive on the part of the co-conspirator to fabricate arose prior to his statements. The court held that a may not be rehabilitated by admitting former statements consistent with his trial testimony. However, where it was charged that the testimony was recently fabricated or that the witness has some motive for testifying falsely, then a prior consistent statement may be admitted, but only if made before the motive to fabricate arose or before the effect of the account could have been foreseen. The court found that that State's attempt to rehabilitate the co-conspirator after impeachment with the investigator's statement merely established that the co-conspirator was not present when the victim was shot and was not inconsistent with the co-conspirator's testimony on cross-examination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his judgment of conviction for the offense of child pornography in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-20.1(a)(2) (1987) by the Circuit Court of McHenry County (Illinois) following a bench trial. Defendant argued that the statute was unconstitutional, that defendant's motion to suppress evidence and statements should have been granted, and that there was proof of a mental element beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to his conviction for the offense of child pornography, defendant appealed contesting the constitutionality of the statute under which he was convicted. First, defendant argued that &sect; 11-20.1(a)(2) was overly vague. The court held that the statute was not overly broad simply because it did not require that the child pornography prohibited be obscene. The court further noted that it was not convinced that defendant had met its burden to show that the statute was unconstitutional with evidence that children will not be harmed by dissemination of themselves in sexual context described in &sect; 11-20.1 merely because the material was deemed &quot;artistic.&quot; Defendant also argued that the statute violated the due process clause of the Federal and State Constitutions. The court held that it was of no consequence that the State treated children differently for certain legal purposes. The State had a special interest in protecting the well-being of its youth. The court further held that the statute did not violate the equal protection clause of the Federal and State Constitution because the legislative classification was not irrational.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment and the sentence of the trial court entered against defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois), which convicted him of violating Deerfield, Ill., Municipal Code art. 8, &sect;&sect; 15 -- 61, 15 -- 62 (1963), a minor curfew ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the ordinance was invalid because its enactment was beyond the village's powers and because it unconstitutionally restricted his freedom of movement. The court found that although the legislature had enacted a statewide curfew applicable to those under age 17, it had also specifically authorized more restrictive curfews at the local level. The court affirmed and held that the village was expressly allowed to adopt its own ordinance applicable to those under age 18 because there was no conflict between the ordinance and the state curfew law. Additionally, the ordinance was identical to another that was upheld even though it restricted the travel and movement of minors because it properly furthered the state's valid interest in protecting its children. The ordinance was therefore justified as a protection imposed in light of the particular vulnerability of children and as a furtherance of the parental role in child rearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's judgment of conviction for violating a curfew ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant public guardian represented minor child in juvenile proceedings relating to her custody.

The court found that the ICWA's provision regarding &quot;good cause&quot; not to transfer jurisdiction should not be interpreted by individual state law. The court held that Illinois' best-interest-of-the-child considerations were therefore inapplicable to ICWA's jurisdictional requirements. The court stated that good cause not to transfer the case to the tribal court had not been shown.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial in the Circuit Court of La Salle County (Illinois), defendant was found guilty of driving with a breath-alcohol concentration of .10 or more in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501(a)(1) (1987). Defendant was found not guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501(a)(2) (1987), and his driver's license was revoked. Defendant then appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state trooper observed defendant's vehicle speeding, allowed the automobile to pass, made a U-turn, and eventually stopped defendant several blocks away. Defendant displayed behavior and symptoms consistent with being under the influence of alcohol. When defendant was unable to complete field sobriety tests, he was charged with violating Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501 (1987). The court stated that what defendant intended to argue on appeal was that Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 95 1/2, para. 6-205 (1987) (mandatory revocation of license) and &sect; 11-501 were in conflict such that the defendant did not know that a violation of &sect; 11-501 would result in revocation of his driver's license. The court held that defendant's contention failed to withstand analysis, holding that it was clear that the Secretary of State was directed to revoke the license of any person convicted under either &sect; 11-501 or a local ordinance similar to it. The revocation was not punishment for the offense, but a collateral regulatory consequence. The court further agreed with the State that &sect; 11-501 was constitutional, as it was an absolute liability offense and the proscribed conduct was manifestly clear.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol, as well as the revocation of his driver's license as a result of that conviction.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 5/4-107(i), due to the vehicle's removed and falsified vehicle identification number.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the owner bought the car, it had a California certificate of title, and he applied for and received an Illinois certificate of title.

The Secretary revoked the car's title and registration and refused to return the car to the owner, and the owner brought an action for damages. The court initially denied the claim due to the owner's failure to exhaust his administrative review remedy and thereafter denied the owner's petition for rehearing. In light of the confusion over jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional &quot;exhaustion&quot; requirements, the court issued a modified opinion, adhering to its previous conclusion that the owner's failure to exhaust his administrative review remedy was jurisdictional and holding that the owner failed to exhaust all other remedies and sources of recovery before seeking a final ruling by the court, and thus, because he failed to satisfy both requirements of &sect; 25 of the Illinois Court of Claims Act, 705 Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The counties sought reimbursement for sums they expended for the care and support of juveniles ordered to be placed in shelter care by the judges of their circuit courts. The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) audited one county's claim and determined that the proper dollar amount was slightly less than that sought. Nonetheless, DCFS was unable to pay the audited sums because it had expended more than the appropriations made to it by the Illinois General Assembly. Accordingly, the court pro rated the total in available DCFS funds to each of the counties. The counties filed a motion to reconsider, and the court held that because the Illinois Constitution gave the Illinois General Assembly, not the agencies, departments, or the courts, the exclusive authority to exercise its discretion in determining whether to make deficiency appropriations and, if so, in what amounts, the court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to award any sums beyond the amount in pro-rations previously made to the counties. The court thereby abolished a previous doctrine followed by the Illinois Court of Claims, under which it had determined when to make such appropriations.</SPAN></P>

A question presented was whether or not the Attorney General had a duty to represent claimant in that litigation, which he did not do.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case challenging the candidacy of the existing judge sought a writ of mandamus to require the State and other respondents to declare that the existing judge was ineligible to run as a retention candidate. The Illinois Compulsory Retirement of Judges Act imposed a mandatory retirement age of 75, but retention was sought under article VI, &sect; 12(d) of the Illinois Constitution. The case was filed after claimant won the primary election to be the Democratic Party candidate and was certified by the State Board of Elections, but it was filed before the general election. The court found that claimant's cause of action arose out of circumstances of the election contest and not the doing of official duties by him and thus he was not entitled to services from the Attorney General. The Attorney General's statutory duty to represent a state judge in litigation arose where the case involved was premised on an act that resulted from the performance of an official act. The court did not address the claim of deprivation of due process under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 on substantive grounds; it stated that neither states nor their officials acting in official capacities were persons under &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant filed a tort cause of action in circuit court against the board, alleging intentional interference of contract and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The circuit court dismissed the case, and the court of appeals upheld that order. During that action, the two-year statute of limitations of Ill. Rev. Stat. (1991), ch. 37, par. 439.22(h) had expired. Then, claimant filed this petition. The board moved to dismiss, and the court granted the motion to dismiss. The court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. (1991), ch. 110, par. 13--217 did not give claimant another year in which to file his action in this court, because it only applied to cases that had been voluntarily dismissed. The court noted that under Ill. Rev. Stat. (1975), ch. 83, par. 24(a), claimant would have had a year from an involuntary dismissal to refile, but that law had been amended in 1977, excluding that option. The court also denied claimant's petition for rehearing, noting that the only new arguments were constitutionally-based, and the court lacked jurisdiction to rule on constitutional issues, and that claimant cited no authority in support of his constitutional claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant employee, a correctional parole counselor sought to recover from respondent State of Illinois for wages she alleged were owed to her.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee had been terminated by the Department of Corrections, but reinstated based upon an order of a circuit court. Thereafter, she was again terminated as a result of administrative proceedings by which it was found she had violated the Department's regulations and policies. An appellate court found the conduct was insufficient to warrant the employee's discharge and she was reinstated with credit to the Department for a period of suspension. The employee sought net back wages. The court found that the employee was entitled to receive full compensation as allowed by Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 127, par. 63b 111b, which was the same as the net back wages she sought to recover. The court found the employee made reasonable attempts to mitigate and her compensation should not be negatively impacted based on claims she did not; however, her damages were offset by a period during which she could not work having been injured in an accident, which meant she would not have been able to work had she not been wrongfully discharged. The court also found the employee was not entitled to recover any interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the employee was due compensation from the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant physician brought a claim against respondent, the Illinois Department of Public Aid, for abortions performed by him for public aid recipients after he had submitted the claims, which were accepted by the Department, but were by the Illinois Comptroller's Office to the Department, which rejected them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department contended that the claims were barred by a statute of limitations and that the State of Illinois was under a permanent injunction, which had been issued by a United States District Court, that had prevented the State from paying the claims. The court held that an injunction, while in force, had to be obeyed. The court concluded that the State took every effort to obey the injunction, which was binding and in effect for the entire time that the abortions were being performed by the physician. The court further concluded on a rehearing by the physician that an official of the State was not authorized to waive the statute of limitations on the claims against the State. The court held that the claim of the physician was barred because they arose more than one year prior to the physician's suit. The court concluded that the physician's petition for rehearing was to be denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the physicians claim against the Department was denied. The court also ordered that the physician's petition for rehearing was denied.</SPAN></P>
