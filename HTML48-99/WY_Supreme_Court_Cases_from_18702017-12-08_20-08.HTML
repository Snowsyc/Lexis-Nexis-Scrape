<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant petroleum corporation challenged a judgment of the District Court of Laramie County (Wyoming), which affirmed a decision of respondent Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission denying appellant's application for a permit to drill an oil well in the northeast corner of an 80-acre tract neighboring a field in which respondent petroleum corporation had an leasehold interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant applied for the permit to drill and oil well, claiming that such a well would recover oil in a portion of the tract that could not have been recovered by existing wells. Respondent resisted the application out of a concern that its own neighboring wells would be adversely affected and the Commission concluded that an additional well was not necessary to prevent waste. Before considering appellant's main contentions on appeal, the court stated that it was necessary to remand the case to the Commission for further proceedings. Further consideration was required of the factual issues tendered pursuant to Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission Rule 303, which in substance was an &quot;escape hatch&quot; to claimed infringement of property rights by Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission Rule 302. Because the Commission had not made adequate factual findings, the matter was not ripe and the court could not conduct the necessary substantial evidence review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court with instructions to enter a judgment vacating the order of the Commission and remanding the proceeding to the Commission for further consideration. The Commission, in its discretion, was to be permitted to grant a rehearing or reargument if it so desired.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a fire fighters local and its president, brought a mandamus action in the District Court of Albany County, Wyoming, to compel defendants, a city and its officials, to comply with 1965 Wyo. Sess. Laws 197. Defendants argued that the statute sought to be enforced was unconstitutional and void. Without resolving the case and entering a final judgment, the district court elected to reserve the constitutional questions to a higher court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs sought to compel defendants to enter into arbitration to determine the terms of a collective bargaining agreement dealing with wages, hours of service, and working conditions. The court remanded plaintiffs' action for mandamus back to the district court and held that the provisions of 1965 Wyo. Sess. Laws 197 did not violate the state constitution. The court found, inter alia, that (1) the constitutional prohibition against the delegation of power was intended to protect against the exercise of the taxing power and other purely municipal functions by officials not subject to the people's control, such that delegation of administrative matters, dealing with collective bargaining of firemen and with the arbitration of unresolved matters, did not violate the constitutional prohibition; (2) a bill could constitutionally contain more than one subject as long as every provision was germane to the subject expressed in the title; and (3) a mandatory direction to submit various matters of difference to arbitrators without the voluntary consent of defendants was not unconstitutional because the state could direct cities to submit labor disputes with firemen to binding arbitration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded plaintiffs' action for a mandamus back to the district court for further proceedings and answered all the reserved questions in the negative. The court found that the state legislation in question did not violate the Wyoming Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a mandamus action brought by plaintiff state, defendant city clerk sought review of the findings and conclusions of the District Court of Laramie County (Wyoming) in favor of the state in its action to determine the validity of the city's proposed financing of a project and the constitutionality of the act for industrial development projects, Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15.1-92 to 15.1-100 (1957). Constitutional questions were reserved for the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city passed ordinances proposing to issue revenue bonds for the purpose of acquiring a refining project, which the city would lease to a refining company. The state, on the relation of the city, brought an action against the clerk to determine the validity of the proposed financing of the project and of the constitutionality of the Act. The state sought to compel execution of an agreement for the acquisition of the project. The trial court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law that held generally that all of the steps taken toward the consummation of the project were legal and proper. The trial court reserved constitutional questions for the court and the clerk sought review of the trial court's findings and conclusions. The court affirmed the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law and further held that the Act and Cheyenne, Wyo., Ordinance 1535, 1538 were not unconstitutional. The financing of the project did not constitute the lending of public credit for a private purpose in violation of Wyo. Const. art. 16, &sect; 6. It was within the power of the legislature to authorize financing by industrial revenue bonds and no credit was extended to a corporation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant city clerk and intervenor state treasurer appealed from a judgment of the District Court of Laramie County, Wyoming, in plaintiff state's action seeking a writ of mandamus and declaratory judgment. Constitutional questions were certified to the court regarding the constitutionality of 1965 Wyo. Sess. Laws 91, which authorized refunding programs to refinance existing public securities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state sought an alternative writ of mandamus and declaratory judgment seeking to compel the city clerk to endorse the city's refunding securities and give notice of prior redemption of the city's outstanding bond securities which were subject to call. This required determination of the constitutional validity of 1965 Wyo. Sess. Laws 91, under which the city's refunding program was undertaken, and the validity of Cheyenne, Wyo., Ordinance No. 1491, which authorized the issuance of the refunding securities. The trial court made findings of fact and conclusions of law, which the city appealed. The trial court certified constitutional questions to the court. The court held that where the bonds contained a provision permitting prior redemption and the city had no way of ascertaining the bondholders' names or addresses, it was wholly impracticable to give personal notice to the bond owners. The court also held that there would be no new debt created by the issuance of the refunding bonds and their interest accruals because the refunding issues would merely be in substitution for but in less amount than the principal bond debt and interest accruals thereon authorized by election.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court judgment as to the objections raised by the city clerk and intervenor state treasurer. The court answered the constitutional questions certified to the court and affirmed the trial court's findings and judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">1961 Wyo. Sess. Laws 234 created a board of insurance agent examiners and provided for the written examination of insurance agents but exempted, among others, those soliciting or selling insurance in connection with motor vehicles sales transactions. Plaintiff charged that the exemption was unconstitutional because it was unreasonable, arbitrary, and unrelated to the purpose of the statute. The trial court found that that the persons in the exempted class sold all of the same types and varieties of insurance as did persons engaged in the general commercial insurance business. The court held that the challenged exemption was unconstitutional under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The wording of the exemption was so broad that it constituted an unreasonable and unwarranted discrimination that could not be justified either as a proper exercise of police power or shielded under the cloak of classification. The statute failed to disclose how the exemption promoted the legislative purpose of better protecting the public from unqualified insurance agents and brokers so as to constitute a reasonable classification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant and appellee both provided automobile insurance coverage to an employer. An employee was involved in an accident while driving a leased vehicle, which resulted in a wrongful death action being filed against his estate and the insurance companies. A judgment was obtained in the wrongful death action and subsequently the trial court ordered appellant to pay the judgment on the basis that it provided primary coverage to the employer. Upon review, the court reversed and remanded. The court found that both insurance companies' policies limited coverage for a hired automobile to excess insurance. The court held that the trial court improperly concluded that appellant's policy constituted the primary coverage where the excess insurance policies of both insurance companies were mutually repugnant. The court determined that it was immaterial which policy was issued first because liability was to be ascertained form a construction of the language of both policies. The court concluded that the liability of the insurance companies needed to be prorated in proportion to the liability limits provided by their respective policies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Three suits were consolidated for consideration of challenges to the constitutionality of Wyoming's Fair Trade Act, Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-8 to 40-17. The court held that the sections were similar or identical to provisions appearing in Fair Trade Acts adopted by 46 states. Of the acts, 17 were upheld as constitutional, 20 were ruled unconstitutional, and six had not yet been challenged. The court answered questions in two cases and affirmed another case, because the Wyoming Fair Trade Act was unconstitutional as an improper delegation of legislative power, as offending the required due process protection, and as being beyond the police power of the state. The court found that the focal point of the constitutional attack was the nonsigner clause, &sect; 40-17. An act burdening a person with a contract covenant agreed to by parties but not by the nonsigning retailer violated that person's liberty not to contract and robbed that person of liberty without due process.</SPAN></P>

Defendants denied plaintiff's and the public's right to either use the channel or to float upon the waters of the river as they crossed their lands, but joined in asking for declaratory judgment. Defendants owned land through which the North Platte River flows. Plaintiff, for himself and the public, claimed the right to use the bed and channel of the river and its waters to fish under license of the State. The court held that the portion of the river in dispute was nonnavigable and that its riparian owners had title to the bed and channel of the river, but that the title was subject to an easement for a right of way of the river's waters in their natural channel through, over and across defendants' lands. The court also held that the judgment of the lower court had to be reversed insofar as it permitted unrestricted walking or wading in or upon the bed or channel of the river and that the judgment be vacated in this respect.</SPAN></P>

The District Court, Sheridan County, Spencer J. Lewis, J., rendered judgment in favor of board and physician appealed. The Supreme Court, Blume, C.J., held that statute relating to creation of county memorial hospitals which provides that board of trustees shall have control of hospital property is not invalid as violating section of constitution providing that legislature shall not delegate to any special commissioner, private corporation or association, any power to perform any municipal functions whatever, since creation and existence of hospital is not a municipal function, but rather a matter of state wide concern and under exclusive control of legislature.</SPAN></P>

C. Stat. &sect;&sect; 26-701to 26-707 (1945) (Act) in its action against the physician for a declaration that if the physician continued to refuse to comply with rules adopted by the board and its medical staff, he forfeited his right to use the board's hospital facilities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The physician was a member of the medical staff of the board's hospital. The board had adopted rules for the management of the hospital and had the power to suspend the privileges of a member of the medical staff for violating the rules. The board's rules included a regulation holding physicians responsible for the preparation of a complete medical report for each patient. The board found that a large number of reports filed by the physician were not complete. Thereafter, a committee of the board recommended that the physician not be reappointed. After a hearing, the board reaffirmed its decision not to reappoint the physician. The board then filed its declaratory judgment action. The district court declared that the physician had forfeited his rights to treat his patients at the board's hospital. The court affirmed and held that the delegation of power to the board under the Act was not an unconstitutional delegation of power under Wyo. Const. art. 3, &sect;&sect; 1 or 37 as argued by the physician. The court explained that the creation of a hospital was under the exclusive control of the state legislature, but that the board was impliedly authorized to adopt reasonable rules.</SPAN></P>

It was stipulated that 36 percent of the pool was disqualified and the court held that this was not substantial compliance with the statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Although the decedent had a minor son from a prior marriage, he left a will designating the executrix, his widow, his sole legatee.

On appeal, the executrix argued that the guardian's petition was insufficient to furnish the basis for any relief sought and that &sect; 6-1504 was void and unconstitutional. The executrix also argued that the trial court should have heard certain evidence, erred in calculating the exemption, and should have set over to the executrix her share of the exemption property. The appellate court agreed that the trial court erred in calculating the amount of the exemption, but otherwise rejected the executrix's contentions. The trial court was not required to hear evidence because the executrix refused to plead further after her demurrer was overruled. The executrix would receive her share of the exemption property under the will. Finally, the statute at issue was not void and the executrix could not challenge its constitutionality because she was not adversely affected by its operation.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that female jurors were eligible to serve as jurors in criminal and civil cases and that 1949 Wyo. Sess. Laws ch. 61 was a valid enactment of the Wyoming Legislature. The court reasoned that the clause guaranteeing a right to a jury trial in which the word &quot;men&quot; appeared was not intended to change, or to prevent the legislature from changing, the statutes then in effect in regard to the persons competent for jury service. The court noted that women, who were qualified jurors under territorial or state statutes, were competent jurors in the federal courts. The court further reasoned that the failure of the legislature to put women in the class of persons competent for jury service until 1949 was attributable to reasons of convenience or as a favor to the excluded persons, and not because of defect of sex.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, the company, and the sheriff, sought review of a judgment from the District Court, Big Horn County (Wyoming) rendered in favor of plaintiff purchaser in an action whereby he sought to restrain defendants from foreclosing mortgage on the purchaser's realty and to have the mortgage adjudged void and canceled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The purchaser bought a clothing company from the seller, who was the mortgagor of the company. The agreement between the parties was that the seller would continue to make the scheduled mortgage payments. Thereafter, the seller died, and several years later, the company sought to foreclose on the mortgage. The purchaser filed an action against the company and the sheriff seeking to enjoin them from proceeding with the foreclosure sale, and to have the mortgage declared void and canceled. The trial court rendered a judgment in favor of the purchaser, and the company and the sheriff appealed the decision. The purchaser reiterated his argument that the action taken by the company was barred by the statute of limitations. The court noted that the statute of limitations barred the cause of action, and not the remedy. In addition, the statute of limitations intended as a retrospective law must have given a person reasonable time to enforce a remedy available to him before the bar of the statute applied. Therefore, the decision of the trial court was erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court was reversed with instructions.</SPAN></P>
