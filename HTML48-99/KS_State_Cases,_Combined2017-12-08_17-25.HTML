The trial court dismissed the felony DUI count, holding that, as third offense DUI was a strict liability offense, not requiring the State to prove criminal intent, the statute violated appellee's right to due process of law. The State appealed. The court reversed, holding that the trial court's reliance on precedent discussing guilt without criminal intent for a misdemeanor did not provide a basis for determining if a conviction for felony DUI is constitutional or unconstitutional; that the legislature may provide for strict liability crimes; and that the state's DUI law providing for third time offender felony treatment is one of the recognized exceptions where the legislature has specifically stated that an offense does not require intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, after a jury trial, challenged his convictions of aggravated indecent liberties with a child in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3504(a)(2)(A) and stalking in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3438(a). The appellate court affirmed the trial court decision. The trial court's denial of appellant's psychological evaluation of the alleged victim request was within the court's discretion because there was significant testimony corroborating the alleged victim's allegations and there was nothing to indicate that the alleged victim had a disease or defect discoverable in a psychological evaluation. The evidence that appellant allegedly abused another child in a similar manner was properly admitted under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-455 because the disputed evidence of the prior crimes was relevant in the instant case and its probative value outweighed potential prejudice. Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3438 was not unconstitutionally vague because the statute terms were words of common understanding whose meaning was not vague. There was sufficient evidence to convict appellant of violating &sect; 21-3438 because there was evidence that appellant's pattern of conduct constituted a credible threat.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A decision overturning an administrative law judge's award and denying workers' compensation benefits to appellant under the Kansas Workers Compensation Act (the Act), Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-505, was reversed. The award of benefits was reinstated, subject to the workers' compensation board's determination on remand regarding what, if any, offset that appellee employer was entitled to due to appellant's retirement benefits. Appellant, a flight attendant, claimed she suffered from carpal tunnel syndrome as a result of her work in the airspace over Kansas, among other places. The appellate court held that appellant sustained an injury in Kansas and was entitled to benefits. According to the court, where a repetitive trauma injury was caused or aggravated by work activities, some of which occurred in Kansas, the injury was compensable. The appellate court held that the Act did not preclude coverage for flight attendants where there was no clear statement from the legislature or proof of pre-emptive federal legislation. Retirement did not preclude appellant from receiving benefits, and medical evidence was not necessary to establish the existence, nature, and extent of the injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged their child endangerment convictions, in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3608, surrounding the third-party abuse and neglect of a child living in their household. The appellant court partially affirmed and partially reversed the decision of the trial court and remanded. Section 21-3608(a) was not unconstitutionally vague, overbroad, or beyond the state's police power. The type of prohibited conduct was clear and no lawful conduct or activities were prohibited. There was insufficient evidence to convict appellant husband of violating &sect; 21-3608; his failure to act was not in itself criminal because he lacked the requisite authority and control over the child and alleged abuser to permit the child's placement in an abusive situation. However, appellant wife's conviction was affirmed as she caused a situation where the abuse could continue by falsely asserting to authorities that the child was not in the house. Such conduct constituted taking an active role in hiding the abuse and effectively turning away help.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed the agency decision. The date fixed for injury purposes was the last day appellant worked.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a prior case, the court had declared a city ordinance assessing stormwater and sewer charges to be invalid because it was not properly enacted in accordance with state law. In this case, two plaintiff ratepayers sought a refund of charges they had paid. The trial court denied the claim based on the volunteer rule, holding that because plaintiffs had paid the fees without protest they were volunteers and were not entitled to a refund. Plaintiffs appealed and the court affirmed the result, but relied on an additional ground while also affirming the trial court's application of the volunteer rule. The prior court decision found that the city ordinance was invalid, but not that it was void. Therefore, the ordinance was binding until it was declared invalid so plaintiffs were not entitled to a refund for prior payments made. The court further found that plaintiffs' payments were voluntary because they did not protest the ordinance. Plaintiffs were not required to have used an administrative process for objecting to the calculation of the assessment, but something more than vague complaints to city officials was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment for defendant city that plaintiffs were not entitled to a refund of charges paid under an invalid ordinance, because the ordinance in issue was only voidable and was in full force and effect until declared to be invalid. Furthermore, the court found that plaintiffs' payments of the charges were voluntary and not subject to refund because plaintiffs did not protest payment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sought review of the decision of the Norton District Court (Kansas), which dismissed three consolidated appeals challenging the constitutionality of Kan.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In these three consolidated habeas corpus petitions, petitioners challenged the constitutionality of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1501 which set a 30 day statute of limitation on the filing of habeas petitions. All three petitions were filed more than 30 days from the date of final administrative action on two disciplinary convictions and one parole denial. On review the court affirmed the lower court, holding the statute was not a bill of attainder because it did not contain the elements of (1) specificity in identification of individuals affected; (2) punishment; and (3) lack of a judicial trial. The court found that the petitioners here were well aware of their claims. These inmates had ample opportunity to be heard through extensive administrative procedures and a review by the district court if timely requested. The court also ruled that the statute was constitutional on its face and that petitioners could not establish that no set of circumstances existed under which the statute would be valid.</SPAN></P>

Appellant claimed that appellees had in bad faith settled the malpractice claim against him without informing him or obtaining his consent to the settlement. The lower court granted each appellees' motions for dismissal and for summary judgment. The supreme court affirmed the lower court's decision. The court found that appellee fund, not appellee insurer, employed the attorneys to represent appellant prior to the settlement hearing. Appellee insurer did not breach its duties of loyalty and allegiance by not notifying appellant of the settlement hearing or retaining attorneys on his behalf who failed to provide him with notice of the settlement hearing. The lower court's grant of summary judgment in favor of appellee insurer was not in error. The court went on to find that appellant's negligence and fraud claims against appellee fund could not succeed because appellee fund had no duty under the Kansas Tort Claims Act, Kan. Stat.

The symbols on the picture represented prohibited prison groups and petitioner offered no evidence that appellees' actions were wrong. Petitioner was not subject to double jeopardy because disciplinary actions under penal institution guidelines did not constitute prosecution of criminal charges.

The court rejected appellee's suggestion that trial courts had discretion as to whether to apply the public access provisions of the Act, depending of the facts of each individual case.

And, the court found a tax exemption should be granted when one not-for-profit corporation leased property to another not-for-profit corporation, and profit was not a dominant motive in the leasing arrangement, any surplus revenue generated by lease was substantially and predominantly related to the purpose of providing humanitarian services, and the property claimed as exempt was actually and regularly used by a community service organization for the predominant purpose of providing humanitarian services.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3437 (1996) unconstitutionally deprived a criminal defendant of the right to confront witnesses guaranteed by the U.S. Const. amend. VI.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee challenged the prosecution's intent to proffer a forensic lab report into evidence to show that the substance in his possession was marijuana. Instead of objecting to the motion on the ground the conclusions of the report would be contested at trial, appellee asserted that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3437 (1996) violated his rights under Kan. Const. B. of R. &sect; 10 and U.S. Const. amend. VI to meet and confront the witnesses against him. The trial court ruled that Kan. Stat.

Ann. &sect; 22-3437 (1996) and caselaw from other jurisdictions, the court ruled that because the statute provided for the accused to determine whether the contents of a report concerning forensic examinations will be contested at trial, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3437 (1996) was constitutional under the U.S. Const. amend. VI. The court noted that it was not unconstitutional to require this right to be affirmatively exercised and that the grounds of the objection have an indicia of merit. Thus, Kan. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment that the statute violated the Sixth Amendment, holding that the statute was constitutional so long as the accused had the right to determine whether the contents of a report concerning forensic examinations will be contested at trial.</SPAN></P>

The court held that Indian reservations were separate and distinct nations that were protected by treaty with the United States and that the exemption statute must have been construed with such conception. However, the court held that appellants were not exempt from the tax because Indian reservations within the boundaries of the state were not included as territories outside the boundaries of the state, a statutory requirement for the exemption. The court affirmed a judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district asserted that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-8230 (as amended)(1987) unlawfully impairs its right to unilaterally terminate its participation in an interlocal cooperative agreement with 15 other school districts. The &sect; 72-8230 extended an interlocal agreement between the districts that terminated by its own terms in 1989. The school district argued that the amended statute violated both the United States and Kansas Constitutions. In the absence of significant impairment, the court would not find a violation of the Contract Clause. Further, the school district failed to show that the amendment allowed the state board to usurp the power granted to it by the Kansas Constitution. The state board did not have the authority to automatically reject a request to withdraw, but had to conduct a hearing whereby opposing sides may present evidence on behalf of their case.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was no unlawful search and that the evidence was admissible. The court ruled that (1) the officers had a reasonable suspicion justifying a stop because defendant was speeding; (2) no stop occurred because defendant had an accident; (3) the officer had a duty to ascertain the identity of the injured driver under Kan.

Defendant admitted to spanking and shaking the child because of her bad conduct, but she contended that the child became injured after she rolled off of the bed. She admitted that when she shook the child her head bobbed back and forth. The court affirmed the district court's judgment that convicted defendant of felony murder because one instance of abuse of a child was a proper underlying felony for a felony-murder conviction. Even though abuse of a child did not require the specific intent to injure, it did require general criminal intent.  Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3609 was not unconstitutionally vague because the phrases &quot;cruel beating&quot; and &quot;inflicting cruel and inhuman corporal punishment&quot; were reasonably definite standards. The district court's instructions to the jury did not violate the rule of jury unanimity because unanimity was not required as to the means by which the crime was committed as long as substantial evidence supported each alternative means. There was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that defendant, cruelly beat, inflicted cruel and inhuman bodily punishment on, and shook the child as prohibited by &sect; 21-3609.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of multiple offenses in connection with a drive by shooting in which he drove the vehicle while a co-defendant did the shooting. On appeal the court affirmed his convictions. Defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on self-defense because, even if the evidence was viewed in the light most favorable to defendant, there was no evidence at trial that defendant reasonably believed force was necessary to defend himself. The court rejected defendant's argument that he was entitled to reversal because evidence of gang affiliation, which was admitted, was not related to the crime charged, nor was it admitted to show a motive for the crimes charged. Defendant failed to object at trial and therefore the issue was not preserved for appeal. Defendant's conviction for felony murder did not merge with the underlying conviction of criminal discharge of a firearm. Defendant did not properly preserve his argument that his consecutive sentences for felony murder and criminal discharge of a firearm violated double jeopardy because it was raised for the first time on appeal. However, the argument was meritless because the two crimes had different elements.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court of appeals, relying on a United States Supreme Court decision, reversed defendant's conviction. The court of appeals found that the trial judge's refusal to submit questions of materiality to the jury violated the federal constitutional right to have a jury determine every element of the crime charged. The State sought review to the Kansas Supreme Court. The court determined that materiality was not an element of the Kansas perjury statute,&nbsp;Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3805(a) (1992 Supp.). Thus, it was not a question for the jury. Under the Kansas criminal perjury statute materiality was a question of law for the trial judge. In the federal system, the United States Supreme Court was free to interpret federal statutes, but Kansas's courts were charged with the interpretation of Kansas's statutes.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was not returned to the county for trial until 18 days before trial, and met with appointed counsel the next day. Defendant's counsel sought a continuance and requested that it be charged against the State. The continuance would have pushed defendant past the 90-day speedy trial deadline. The trial court also instructed the jury that sodomy included both types of oral copulation and did not require unanimity on the type of oral copulation. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that: (1) the trial court did not err when it charged the continuance against defendant and not the State; (2) unanimity as to the type of oral copulation was not required; and (3) the trial court considered the proper factors in sentencing and did not violate defendant's right to remain silent.</SPAN></P>

The evidence was part and parcel of the crimes charged. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow defendant to inform the jury that he had already been convicted of conspiracy and aggravated assault in the first trial, as an attempt to utilize the result of his previous trial to indicate he should not be found guilty of the charges on which the first jury was unable to reach a verdict was not relevant. The trial court properly excluded evidence of witnesses' gang membership. Reading a vicarious liability instruction during voir dire, after jury selection, and at the close of the case was not error.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The LCC was a board made up of the leadership of the Kansas House and Senate. In a contested election, the two candidates were required to appear before the legislature for a decision drawn by lots. Both parties were represented by counsel. The LCC requested that the state pay the costs and attorney fees, arguing the payments were a mandatory obligation of the state under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 25-1452. The payments were refused. The LCC brought this action to compel payment. The appropriation officials contested the writ, arguing the debts were illegal because payment of the LCC's vouchers would violate campaign finance laws and Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 24, which required a specific appropriation. The court found the costs for insuring the ballots were accurately counted were appropriate expenses under &sect; 25-1452, but that attorney's fees were not.

The arrestees maintained that the own recognizance-cash deposit bond authorized by the rules of the judicial district violated the arrestees' constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arrestees alleged that the pretrial release procedure, Third Judicial District Court Rule 3.311, was unconstitutional. Under the own recognizance-cash deposit bond provision, the judge set a bond amount. The arrestees were required to deposit 10 percent of that amount with the clerk of the district court. The arrestees received 90 percent of that deposit back upon completion of all obligations to the court--unless the arrestees had other financial obligations such as back child support or outstanding fines. If there were outstanding financial obligations, the $ 90 would be applied to those. Ten percent of the deposit would be kept as an administrative fee. The trial court dismissed the arrestees' suit pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-212(b)(1), (6). On appeal, the court affirmed and held: (1) there was no statutory authority for one district court to sit in judgment of a coequal district court; (2) the arrestees had other relief available through a motion to reduce bond or file a writ of habeas corpus; (3) the arrestees failed to show irreparable harm to justify equitable relief; and (4) the judges were immune from liability for judicial functions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment from the Shawnee District Court (Kansas), which convicted defendant of first-degree murder, aggravated robbery, and conspiracy to possess hallucinogenic drugs with intent to sell. The trial court sentenced defendant to a controlling term of life plus 58 months in prison. The trial court denied defendant's pretrial motion to suppress a photographic lineup identification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose out of the murder and robbery of a small-time drug dealer. Affirming, the court found that defendant failed to preserve his objections to the photographic lineup because he did not object at trial and that no substantial likelihood of misidentification existed due to the reliability of the courtroom identifications, based upon the witnesses' opportunity to view the accused at the time of the crime, their degree of attention, the accuracy of their prior descriptions, their level of certainty, and the length of time between the crime and the confrontation. The court held that defendant did not establish a prima facie case under Batson because he failed to show that the juror was a member of a certain race. The court concluded that a witness's passing reference to defendant's invocation of his Miranda rights was harmless error. The court held that a conference between the trial court and counsel about a jury question was not a critical stage at which defendant's presence was required and that marijuana found in defendant's apartment five weeks after the murder was too remote to be part of the res gestae, but its admission into evidence was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-340 et seq., which authorized a procedure whereby the voters of the county could adopt a consolidated government for the county and the city. Based on the distinction between a private group and a public administrative agency, the district attorney contended that the commission was a private group, as opposed to a public agency or board. The unified government argued that the commission was not an independently existing private association, but was a public administrative agency, created by statute, which the legislature properly delegated power to. The court denied the district attorney's petition for quo warranto. The court held that the commission was a public administrative agency. The commission was created by the legislature, to do as the legislature ordered. It was organized for the exclusive legislative purpose of preparing a plan to consolidate the two governments, with its powers prescribed by statute. Thus, the court concluded that it did not exist prior to or independent of legislative authorization.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) ruled that documents gathered and produced by the state board of nursing in connection with its investigation of decedent's death were protected by statutory privileges. Appellant parents and estate administrators took an interlocutory appeal from the district court's decision. The issues were whether the board documents were privileged and whether Kans. Stat. Ann. 65-1135(a) (Supp. 1997) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent died from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. The parents alleged that the emergency room nurse, who initially assessed decedent's condition, did not recognize its seriousness and did not alert a physician to the need for immediate attention. The hospital's first motion sought a protective order limiting use of documents obtained by the parents' counsel from the board relative to its investigation of the emergency nurse. The court held that although the interest in creating a statutory peer review privilege was strong, it was outweighed by the fundamental right of the parents to have access to all the relevant facts. The district court's protective order and order granting other discovery relief denied the parents that access and thus violated their right to due process and a fair determination of their malpractice action against the hospital and doctor. The information generated by the peer review committee, detailing the committee's decision-making process, was not subject to discovery by the parents. Forms and documents containing factual accounts and witnesses' names were not protected simply because they also contained the committee's conclusions or decision-making process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's protective orders were reversed. The district court was directed to proceed to craft a protective order that would permit the parents' access to the relevant facts. The district court could simply redact that which was protected. The statute was presumed to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged his hard 40 sentence. The trial court found two aggravating circumstances and one non-statutory mitigating one. The court remanded for resentencing because the trial court erred in finding that the risk of death to a Colorado man who was kidnapped after the escape was an aggravating circumstance under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4636(b). The court found that any danger posed to the man was not sufficiently tied to the jailer's murder. The court held that the standard of proof for aggravating circumstances under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4635(c) was preponderance of the evidence and that the trial court properly found that defendant killed the jailer to avoid prosecution for the crime for which he was in jail, even though he had already entered into a plea agreement on that charge. The court concluded that age was not a mitigating circumstance in every case and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by rejecting defendant's other non-statutory mitigating factors, including lax operation of the county jail, defendant's lack of violent prior convictions, and his remorse.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed the Board's decision and affirmed the decision of the administrative law judge. Kan. Stat.

The court found that, when an initial medical condition itself progressed into complications more serious than the original injury, the added complications were compensable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with violating Kan. Stat.

The trial court found that &sect; 32-1003(g) was unconstitutional because the statute used the term &quot;animal.&quot; Thus, the trial court found that the statute made it a crime to shine a spotlight on a dog from a vehicle in which a weapon was located. The State appealed and argued that the legislature intended the term &quot;animal&quot; to mean &quot;wildlife&quot; animals. The court disagreed and affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found that legislature used the term &quot;wildlife&quot; 28 times throughout Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 32-1002 - 32-1005. Thus, an average person could conclude that the term &quot;animal&quot; meant something other than &quot;wildlife&quot; as it appeared in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32-1003(g).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant for the kidnapping and murder of a teenager who was going to testify against him in another case. On appeal, defendant argued that because the procedure for determining whether a criminal defendant was competent under Kan. Stat.

The court reviewed the procedure and concluded that &sect; 22-3302 provided defendant with an adequate procedure; and, therefore, was constitutional. The court then reviewed the factors that the trial court considered in determining that defendant was competent to stand trial and held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in making that determination. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on self-defense, but after reviewing the record, the court held that there was simply no evidence that would allow a jury to determine that the defendant acted in self-defense. The record also established that the trial court did consider mitigation evidence required by &sect; 21-4635(b) and concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that defendant had failed to preserve for appeal his challenges to the statements and waiver because he had not properly objected at trial. At defendant's competency hearing, two doctors testified that he understood the proceedings or could assist in his defense. The court found the competency statute constitutional because the district court could measure the evidence by the preponderance of evidence standard.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment by the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas), which convicted him of first-degree murder, aggravated kidnapping, aggravated assault, and kidnapping. Defendant contended that a second-degree murder instruction was appropriate, that evidence was erroneously introduced at trial, that the statute of limitations had run on some of the charges, and that the State's peremptory strike of a juror constituted reversible error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant ran a drug operation and the victim owed him drug money. Defendant and several others forcible removed the victim from a home and killed her. On appeal, the court held that defendant's evidence of second-degree murder was not substantial enough to justify a jury finding that defendant did not act with premeditation or deliberation in shooting the victim, even when viewed in a light most favorable to him. The court also held that the gun and drug evidence was relevant under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-455 because there was sufficient testimony indicating that the seized weapons were used in the murder and kidnapping. Furthermore, the gun and drug evidence corroborated the testimony of the accomplices. The court found that the two year statute of limitation for the crimes other than murder was tolled under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3106(7)(a) (Supp. 1996) due to defendant's voluntary absence from the state due his incarceration in another state. The court determined that the State's use of a preemptory strike against the only black venireperson was not reversible error because the State articulated a race-neutral explanation for striking the juror in question.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held in favor of the secretary of human resources and the director of workers compensation, holding that the Act was constitutional, and the workers appealed. The court ruled that determining whether a statute violated the constitution was a question of law and that when determining a question of law, the court could exercise an unlimited de novo standard of review. Further, the court held that a statute was presumed constitutional, and all doubts must have been resolved in favor of its validity. The court affirmed the judgment holding the Act constitutional, finding that the Act provided compensation for injured workers without proof of negligence or fault, a benefit not allowed under typical tort law. The court concluded that while several amendments of the Act did not restrict an employee's right to receive workers compensation benefits, several other amendments were enacted with the intent to expand an employee's rights.</SPAN></P>

At the preliminary hearing, defendant challenged the constitutionality of the HVS, claiming a due process violation because the HVS did not provide for a pre-revocation administrative hearing. The issue was whether the HVS were unconstitutional because they failed to provide due process. The court found that the HVS constitutional and reversed the district court. Defendant received the process he was due. The court ruled that the Due Process Clause had never been construed to require that the procedures used to guard against an erroneous deprivation of a protectible &quot;property&quot; or &quot;liberty&quot; interest be so comprehensive as to preclude any possibility of error. The Due Process Clause simply did not mandate that all governmental decision-making comply with standards that assured perfect, error-free determinations.</SPAN></P>

It made claim for return of that money, and the investment fiduciaries asserted that the claims were barred by the statute of limitations. The court held that the trial court's ruling refusing to grant summary judgment to the defendants was proper. Retirement system was asserting a public right or protecting property held for public use; therefore, its actions were all governmental in character, to which no statute of limitations applied prior to the enactment of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-522, which provided a 10-year statute of limitations. Since the legislature intended &sect; 60-522 to be applied retroactively, any time barred claims would have been revived. Collateral estoppel did not prevent litigation of the claim because the purposes of collateral estoppel did not exist, and its application would have fostered injustice and allowed allowing a federal court to preclude consideration of its erroneous determination of state law.

The Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) excluded certain prior convictions from defendant's criminal history, which resulted in a criminal history classification of &quot;I&quot; and a sentence of eight months' imprisonment. The State of Kansas appealed upon a question reserved, pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3602(b)(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to nine criminal charges that were brought in three separate complaints, which had been consolidated for trial. He was placed on probation in a community corrections facility. Defendant later pleaded guilty to escaping from the facility. The State conceded that defendant's cocaine possession conviction could not be counted in determining his criminal history. However, the State asserted that the remaining eight convictions should be counted. The district court found that the convictions could not be counted due to the fact that they had been consolidated with a conviction that was used as an element of the charged offense. On appeal, the court noted that a prior conviction that was used as an element of a subsequently charged offense could not be used in determining the criminal history category for that offense, but that all other prior convictions were to be used, unless prohibited by statute. The court thus found that the trial court erred in failing to use the eight convictions because none were used as an element of the escape charge, there was no statutory prohibition to their use, and they were otherwise applicable in scoring the criminal history.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to life for the murder conviction, and to 5 to 20 years each for the robbery and aggravated burglary convictions, with the sentences to run consecutively. Upon review, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that all evidence that derived from defendant's confession was admissible because defendant was not in custody for the hour that led up to his confession; thus, as there was no custodial interrogation, there was no requirement for the police to read him his Miranda rights. Further, the court held that the police was not required to clarify defendant's ambiguous request for counsel before he signed a consent to search form, and they were allowed to ignore the request without violating defendant's Fifth Amendment right to counsel; thus, the evidence that was obtained as result the consent form was admissible.

The court held that the Secretary had a right to require the inmates to reimburse the state for their keep and maintenance, and that the assessment of a monthly service fee for administering the trust accounts did not violate their due process rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Due to a consolidation, the employees, police officers, were transferred from the employ of the City to the Riley County, Kansas, Law Enforcement Agency.

Sixteen years after the change, the employees brought their 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action in federal court. The federal court dismissed the action and venue was transferred to the district court. The district court found that there was a five-year statute of limitations for the employees' action under Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the day he died, the victim told police that he intended to take care of some boys who were threatening his sons. Thereafter, he found defendant and three other boys in a park and started a fight. The victim chased the boys with a baseball bat. Subsequently, each boy grabbed a golf club and started chasing the victim. When one boy fell, the victim hit him twice with the bat. Defendant subsequently hit the victim in the head with his club, the club stuck in the victim's head, and defendant ran away. Defendant returned to the scene later with his mother and his mother's boyfriend to confess to police. At one point, defendant's mother invoked defendant's right to remain silent, after which defendant was transported to the police station. At the police station, defendant gave a second confession to another officer after waiving his Miranda rights again. The court held that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that defendant recklessly killed the victim while manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of the victim's life and that &sect; 21-3402(b) was not unconstitutionally vague. The court also found that the videotape of defendant's second confession was admissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner was an enrolled member of an Indian tribe.

The county again appealed. The court reversed and remanded. The court held that if the State's laws permitted it, there was no impediment to ad valorem taxation of privately owned land within the bounds of a reservation. All Indian land was excluded from the boundaries of the State pursuant to the 1861 Act. The Treaty of 1861, 12 Stat. 1191, included a provision that if tribal land was assigned in fee simple, the land became subject to ad valorem taxes. Provisions in the Treaty of 1867, 15 Stat. 531, which stated that tribal lands were not within the boundaries of the state, did not apply to the landowner's property.

The company leased property adjacent to the storage filed on which it had several oil and gas wells. The court found that there was nothing unconstitutional about permitting anyone to be considered an injector for purposes of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 55-1210. The statute did not entitled injectors to condemn property and the testing provisions did not constitute a taking of property. Thus the testing provisions were constitutional.

Ann. &sect; 19-2765(a)(9), authorized levying general taxes assessed on an ad valorem basis against appellee taxpayer's personal property to pay bonds issued for a sewer lateral reconstruction project.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With the approval of the district, the taxpayer built its own sewer trunk line. A few years later, voters approved bond issues financed by ad valorem taxes on all taxable property in the district for the reconstruction of sewer laterals in a residential area within the district. Although the taxpayer's real property was exempt, the cost of the project, through taxes assessed on its personal property, fell primarily on the taxpayer. The taxpayer argued that the district's sewer lateral reconstruction project provided no &quot;benefit&quot; to the taxpayer's properties under &sect; 19-2765(a)(9). However, the court held that, although there was no direct benefit to the taxpayer, the taxpayer's personal property received indirect benefits from the project even though they were slight compared to the taxes assessed. The court noted that the project was to prevent sewage overflows as had occurred in the past on a street that served the taxpayer's property. The court further explained that &sect; 19-2765(a)(9) did not specify how much benefit had to be received by the taxpayer and that the entire district benefitted from reduced maintenance costs for the streets and sewers resulting from the project.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the tax rate schedule was unconstitutional and that it had subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiff's tax refund claim. Upon review, the court reversed. The court determined the tax schedule was not unconstitutional because the discriminatory classification was rationally related to the state's legitimate interest of promoting marriage. The court noted that under the rational basis standard, a close fit or mathematical perfection between a legislative goal and the means chosen to further that goal was not required. The court found that it was rational for the state to speculate that favorable tax treatment for married taxpayers in the form of lower rates would encourage single taxpayers to get married, thereby fulfilling a valid state objective.

Defendant cross-appealed the district court's decision to deny his motion in limine by which defendant contended that any statements he made on the House floor was protected under the Speech and Debate Clause of the Kansas Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a state representative who made statements to another representative on the House floor during a vote on a bill. The State contended that defendant attempted to blackmail the representative into giving a certain vote on the bill. In a preliminary hearing on the charges, defendant's motion in limine to exclude from evidence the statements he made on the floor was denied; however, his motion to dismiss the action was granted. The State's motion to amend the complaint was denied, and both parties appealed. Upon review, the court affirmed the dismissal of the charges because it also determined that defendant's statements on the House floor were protected under the Speech and Debate Clause of the Kansas Constitution, at Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 22. The court held that defendant's statements were protected under the state constitution because his utterance on the legislative floor, which related to a pending vote on a legislative bill was a legislative act, regardless of the content of the statement. Thus, the court held, because the statements could not be introduced as evidence, the State was left without any evidence to proceed with the blackmail charges.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, pursuant to Kan. Stat.

The court held a contention &sect; 21-3701(3)&nbsp;unconstitutionally invaded the province of the jury was not preserved for assertion on appeal. The court rejected a contention the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions because no direct evidence established that defendant was not married to the six-year old victim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two defendants were charged with battery and one was charged with drug-related crimes. All three defendants had been found guilty of their respective crimes in prison disciplinary proceedings and had been sentenced to segregation, restriction of privileges, and fines. The district court ruled that the Double Jeopardy Clause precluded criminal prosecution for the crimes for which the inmates had already been disciplined. In reversing the district court's orders of dismissal, the court ruled that the subsequent criminal prosecutions were not barred by double jeopardy. The determinative issue was whether the preceding administrative disciplinary penalties constituted &quot;punishment&quot; under recent jurisprudence. The court ruled that the prison discipline imposed did not rise to the level of punishment or multiple prosecution for double jeopardy purposes. Disciplinary rules and procedures were necessary for the control of dangerous and desperate individuals unwillingly confined in such institutions, in order to protect employees, inmates, and visitors. The general rule that prison discipline did not bar subsequent prosecution under criminal laws for the same conduct remained.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant challenged the exclusion of the expert testimony. The court held that expert testimony regarding eyewitness identification should not be admitted into trial. The court noted that such expert testimony pertained to matters of common knowledge, which were not beyond the ken of lay jurors, making expert testimony unnecessary. Defendant also took issue with the photographic lineup from which he was identified, arguing that it was unduly suggestive. The court held that defendant's failure to object at trial to the second photographic lineup, the procedures used to create the lineup, and his subsequent identification from the lineup precluded review of the issues on appeal.

This removed any thought of vindictiveness against defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction. The district court failed to articulate his reasons for the more sever sentence.

Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 50-year-old daughter filed an action against her parents under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-523 (1992), alleging that less than three years prior to the filing of the lawsuit, she had spontaneously remembered that her father sexually abused her as a minor and that her mother had failed to protect her. On appeal of the lower court's dismissal of her action, the daughter argued that her action did not accrue until she remembered the abuse and that &sect; 60-515(a), which included the eight-year statute of repose upon which the lower court relied, did not apply to her. The court disagreed, finding that the eight-year statute of repose contained in &sect; 60-515(a) applied to persons who were minors at the time of the act. The daughter nonetheless argued that &sect; 60-523, which was passed after the statute of repose expired, revived her claim. The court ruled that while the legislature could pass a law to retroactively revive actions barred by statute of limitations, it could not, without violating due process, retroactively revive a cause of action already barred by a statute of repose. Such action, found the court, would be deprivation of a defendant's property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff book club, an out-of-state based business, sold books to elementary school teachers and students throughout the United States. The Kansas Department of Revenue (KDR) assessed a use tax on the gross receipts of the book club's sales in Kansas under the Kansas Compensating Tax Act (KCTA), Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3701 et seq. The Director of Taxation (Director) upheld the tax and the Board of Tax Appeals (BOTA) affirmed the Director's order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The book club claimed that it was not subject to the compensating tax because it was not a retailer doing business in the state of Kansas and did not have a nexus with the state. After reviewing the facts, this court concluded that application of the KCTA did not violate the Commerce Clause. Although the book club did not have bank accounts in Kansas and none of its employees conducted business in the state, the book club had more of a connection with Kansas than catalog sales through the mail or by common carrier. The book club's use of the Kansas teachers to sell their product to Kansas students provided a substantial nexus with the state of Kansas that permitted the conclusion that it was a retailer doing business in the state.</SPAN></P>

Defendant allegedly conspired with her boyfriend, who allegedly shot and killed defendant's husband. She was convicted of aiding and abetting murder and conspiracy to commit murder. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court correctly admitted evidence that defendant fled the state, travelled to Louisiana under an assumed name, and disguised herself. The court held that evidence that defendant had a large sum of money at the time of her arrest was also admissible. The court stated that evidence that she took a polygraph prior to leaving the state was inadmissible because its admission would have implied that the results of the test were favorable to defendant. The court further held that a bill of particulars was sufficient, the prosecutor's remark regarding defendant's post-arrest silence did not constitute reversible error, and the evidence was sufficient. The court held that testimony that defendant had previously inquired into whether a person would kill her husband was admissible and other trial rulings were proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fathers of children involved in interscholastic athletics sued the association. The association's rules prohibited the high school basketball players from attending competitive summer basketball camps, from concurrently playing on non-school teams, or from receiving private instruction from non-school personnel. The association was organized under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-130 (1995) and handled interscholastic athletics for approximately 90 percent of Kansas high schools. The court first agreed with the district court that the fathers met the minimal requirements for standing under the Declaratory Judgment Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 61-1701 et seq. However, the court reversed the district court's holding that the association's rules were void ab initio as an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. The legislature did not impose any statutory requirements on the association and did not delegate or sub-delegate rule-making authority to the association. Rather, it was a nonprofit corporation consisting of voluntary members. The association adopted its own rules, and high schools were not required to join the association and could withdraw their membership at any time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was in jail on an unrelated offense when he became a suspect in the murder investigation.

An attorney represented defendant on the unrelated charge. Even though the police told defendant they could not talk about the murder with him because of the representation, defendant insisted on talking about the murder. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court erred in failing to suppress evidence. The court affirmed the judgment. In doing so, the court held that the trial court properly refused to suppress the evidence collected from a search of defendant's personal effects because such effects were lawfully seized and subject to search without a warrant or probable cause. The prosecutor's statement that defendant was in jail on an unrelated offense did not violate the motion in limine because the fact that defendant was in jail explained his location when his clothing was searched by the police and when the police talked to him about the crime.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court determined that felony computer crime pursuant to Kan. Stat.

When the officer activated his lights, the vehicle fled. A chase ensued, during which the vehicle drove through a private yard, went through a garden, and drove into a wheat field where it finally stopped. The officer chased the driver and arrested him. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress, holding that at the time the officer turned on his lights to stop defendant, he had no probable cause to do so.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of a judgment from the Ellis District Court (Kansas), which dismissed the possession of marijuana charges in two separate criminal cases against defendants on the basis of double jeopardy. One defendant sought review of his conviction from the district court that convicted him of marijuana possession and that denied his motion to suppress. The cases were consolidated on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An informant told the police officers that defendant was growing marijuana in his basement. The informant went before a judge so that the officers could obtain a search warrant. The search revealed the presence of marijuana, but not a growing operation in the basement. The court affirmed defendant's conviction for possession because his motion to suppress was properly denied. Even though defendant was allowed to attack an affidavit that supported a search warrant if the affidavit contained deliberate falsehoods, the rule did not apply because the falsehoods had to be made by a government agent. The court reversed the district court's judgment that dismissed the State's cases because the payment of a tax under the Kansas Drug Tax Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-5201 et seq. barred subsequent criminal prosecution on charges that arose from possessing drugs. The Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution and Kan. Const. Bill of Rights &sect; 10 did not bar the subsequent criminal prosecution because a civil sanction only invoked double jeopardy protections if it was grossly disproportional to legitimate state goals that were separate from those served by criminal prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's judgment that convicted defendant of drug possession. The court reversed and remanded the district court's judgments that dismissed the State's cases on the basis of double jeopardy and remanded the actions to the district court with directions to reinstate the charges against defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee had been employed by the consolidated City of Wichita and Sedgwick County Emergency Communications Department (ECD) for approximately 18 years. Operation of the consolidated ECD was transferred to the county. The employee became a county employee. Based on her reduced retirement benefits, the employee filed a complaint. She later returned to city employment and was reinstated in the city's plan. The employee filed an amended complaint. The city and the county filed motions for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. The court affirmed. The employee lacked standing. She had returned to the city and rejoined the plan. Even if the joint ordinance/resolution had been unconstitutional, the employee no longer had a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy and could obtain no relief from such a finding. In addition, the alternative relief sought, specific performance, was unnecessary. She had returned to the city and was participating in the retirement plan. The employee's lower expected benefits were the result of her lower salary, not because of any modification by the city. The county was not liable; it was a separate legal entity.</SPAN></P>

The city and airport authority were a single employer subject to PERRA. The PERB had jurisdiction to determine the petitioned for unit determination.

Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the Sexually Violent Predator Act (the Act) and also raised various other ground for reversing the finding and order of the trial court. He argued that the Act violated the prohibition against double jeopardy and ex post facto laws, failed to prove equal protection and procedural and substantive due process, and was void as overly broad and vague. The court stated that the record indicated that defendant had at least three felony convictions prior to being charged in the present case. Under the Habitual Criminal Act, defendant's sentence could have been tripled. Additionally, the sentences could have been ordered to run consecutively rather than concurrently. However, the court also stated that the state's own evidence was that defendant was being committed even though he did not suffer from mental illness. Defendant was not mentally ill, and the criminal offenses he committed were not the result of mental illness. Therefore, the Act violated the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's criminal history included four juvenile adjudications, one of which was for burglary.

The trial court ruled that defendant was not eligible for retroactive sentence conversion because of the juvenile adjudication for burglary, and the appellate court affirmed. The court found no error, holding that the requirement that juvenile adjudications be considered in calculating an offender's criminal history score did not conflict with the statement in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-1601 that a juvenile adjudication was not to be deemed or held to import a criminal act. Although there was no right to a jury trial in juvenile proceedings, consideration of juvenile adjudications did not violate defendant's due process rights. Moreover, consideration of juvenile adjudications did not violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws because defendant's ineligibility for sentence conversion was not a punishment for his prior juvenile adjudications but was a consequence of his repeat offender status.</SPAN></P>

The Rooks District Court (Kansas) dismissed five counts that were written in statutory language for insufficiency because they lacked sufficient detail as to the specific criminal conduct involved. The dismissed counts charged defendant with criminal threat, stalking, harassment by telephone, and misdemeanor theft.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to dismiss the indictment without first moving for a bill of particulars. The State urged on appeal that the five dismissed counts were sufficient because they clearly charged each element of each offense and were phrased in the words of the applicable statute. Reversing as to four of the five counts, the court held that defendant was obligated to request a bill of particulars under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3201(f) (Supp. 1994) before asking for dismissal of counts that were drawn in the language of the statute and were legally sufficient under &sect; 22-3201(b) and Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 10. The court found that a requirement that defendant knew his or her threat would be communicated to the person terrorized was not an element of the offense of criminal threat under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3419 (Supp. 1994) and that it was sufficient if there was an intent to terrorize or an act in reckless disregard of causing such terror. The court affirmed the dismissal of the stalking count because the indictment charged a violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3438 (Supp. 1994), which was unconstitutional and was not in effect when some of the charged conduct occurred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a relationship with the alleged victim. After the relationship ended, the alleged victim reported that defendant made repeated contacts with her. He was charged with one count of stalking. On appeal, the court found that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. Section 21-3438 contained no guidelines to determine when a following became alarming, annoying or harassing. There was no definition of the terms alarming, annoying or harassing in relation to an objective standard when a charge of stalking was based upon &quot;following.&quot; Thus, that portion of the statute proscribing the intentional and malicious following when such following seriously alarmed, annoyed or harassed the person made the statute unconstitutionally vague. In the absence of an objective standard, the terms annoys, alarms, and harasses subjected defendant to the particular sensibilities of the individual victim. Persons of common intelligence must necessarily have guessed at the statute's meaning and differed as to its application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The KCC's 1994 amendments to the BPO arose out of an application made on the basis that the BPO was not fulfilling its statutory mandates. The amendments were affirmed by the district court and affirmed by the court on appeal. The Natural Gas Conservation Act, Ken. Gen. Stat. &sect; 55-701 et seq. (1935), empowered the KCC to prevent waste, avoid uncompensated drainage, and assure orderly development and production of natural gas in Kansas. The court stated that there was sufficient evidence to support the acreage factor amendment and that the KCC was statutorily authorized to make such an amendment under Kan. Stat. Ann. m 55-703(a). Further, though cross-examination on this issue was restricted, the complaining corporation was not deprived of its due process rights because the amendment was based only upon evidence that had been subject to cross-examination. Further, the KCC did not err by limiting a well's allowable to its demonstrated capacity to produce, by expanding the time allotted to produce existing underage, or by allowing certain pipeline companies to intervene in the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3826 (1994), on the ground that it was a constitutionally impermissible delegation of legislative authority. The pending charge of possession of marijuana was dismissed without prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 21-3826 provided &quot;contraband&quot; was any item that was brought into a correctional facility without the consent of the facility's administrator. Section 21-3826 replaced a prior statute that provided a &quot;laundry list&quot; of contraband. The trial court sustained defendant's argument on the ground that &sect; 21-3826 violated the separation of powers doctrine by giving the administrator unfettered discretion in the determination of what constituted contraband. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court's dismissal of the marijuana charge deprived the court of jurisdiction. The marijuana charge was dismissed to allow the appeal of the trafficking charge. The court examined the legislative purpose of the statutes that delegated power to prison officials, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-5201 et seq., and held that the &quot;laundry list&quot; from the prior statute was insufficient. The administrator had a legitimate interest in prohibiting dangerous items in the facility, and normal items could be dangerous in the facility. The administrator's authority to promulgate and publish facility rules was not arbitrary or capricious. Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3826 was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's dismissal of the trafficking charge, held that the statute was constitutional, and remanded the trafficking charge against defendant for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An injured minor and her parents, brought a medical malpractice action against defendants, a doctor and a hospital. The judgment against the doctor was seven times the limit of her insurance obtained through the fund. The injured minor and her parents brought a garnishment action in federal court against the fund for the fund's bad faith conduction of the doctor's defense and in failing to settle the claim. The federal court certified the following questions to the court: did Kansas law recognize a claim of bad faith against defendant Health Care Stabilization Fund (fund) when a judgment was returned in excess of the fund's statutory liability limits, and could the injured prosecute such a bad faith action against the fund by way of garnishment in light of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-723(d)? The court held that Kansas law did not recognize a claim against the fund for bad faith and refusal to settle.

The father argued that the best interests of the child standard of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-1563(d) violated his constitutional right to custody of his child absent a finding of unfitness. The State argued that the father's fundamental constitutional rights had to give way to the best interests of the child test. The court stated that a parent who was not found to be unfit had a fundamental right, protected under the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, to the care, custody, and control of his or her child, and that a parent's right to custody of a child could not be taken away in favor of a third person absent a finding of unfitness on the part of the parent. The court construed the best interest of the child language of &sect; 38-1563(d) to be constitutional when applied in a child in need of care case when the trial court found by clear and convincing evidence that the parent was unfit or that highly unusual or extraordinary circumstances existed which substantially endangered the child's welfare.

The criminal history sheet also stated that he had three misdemeanor convictions for driving while suspended, the third of which was treated as a felony under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-262. Based on the two felonies, defendant received an enhanced sentence. On appeal, the court remanded the matter for further sentencing proceedings. The court determined that an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction that resulted in incarceration could not be used in determining the criminal history, absent a showing by the state that the right to counsel was waived. The court then noted that defendant was jailed on one of the battery convictions and that the record was silent as to whether he was represented by counsel.

The claimant sought to have his monthly maintenance payments excluded from his available income. The SRS refused. The district court found that the SRS had erred.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot and killed his girlfriend and was convicted of first degree murder, aggravated kidnapping, and unlawful possession of a firearm. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that upon imposition of a hard 40 sentence, the phrase &quot;automatic review&quot; under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4627(1) (Supp. 1992) required that review had to be given even though defendant failed to properly follow the normal procedural rules for perfecting an appeal. Thus, the court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal. The jury's determination that the murder was committed in an especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel manner was supported by substantial competent evidence. Defendant chased the victim to the lobby of a restaurant, shot her twice, forced her into the kitchen and when she tried to flee, shot her again. As she was barely able to move yet still trying to escape, he, after a long series of clicks from his jammed gun, administered the final two bullets. A statement by the victim of an earlier aggravated battery was properly admitted because it was admissible to show that defendant was distraught over their breakup and had bearing on his intent to kill the victim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State sought review of an order of the Ellsworth District Court (Kansas), which dismissed a complaint against defendant for possession of marijuana and possession of marijuana without a tax stamp. The district court found that further prosecution of the complaint would have constituted double jeopardy because a drug tax had already been assessed and partially satisfied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to the order of the district court dismissing the State's complaint against defendant, the State appealed. Upon review of the case, the court examined whether the assessment and payment of amounts allegedly owed under the Kansas Drug Tax Act constituted a criminal punishment for double jeopardy purposes. The United States Supreme Court had previously held that that tax on the possession of illegal drugs assessed after the State had imposed criminal penalty for the same conduct constituted a second punishment in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. Reversing and remanding the district court's judgment, the court held that the Kansas Drug Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-5201 et seq. did not consist of the &quot;unusual feature&quot; of a Montana tax which based its tax on the commission of a crime and that the taxpayer was still in possession of the property when the tax was imposed. In Montana the tax was imposed after the contraband had been confiscated. The court noted that &sect; 79-5201 et seq. did not impose a criminal penalty on defendant because the revenue collection did not expressly depend on the illegal nature of the sale or possession of marijuana.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of premeditated first-degree murder, aggravated kidnapping, aggravated criminal sodomy, and rape. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and sentences. The court held that defendant had no right to have a jury decide whether he received the hard 40 sentence because he waived a jury determination of his guilt. A specific waiver by defendant on the record of the right to a jury determination of the hard 40 sentence issue was not required when defendant pled guilty to first-degree murder and was subject to the hard 40 sentence. The state gave notice of its intention to seek the hard 40 sentence as required under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4624(1) (1993) but was not required to give notice of the evidence it would use as aggravating factors. Defendant's confession was validly obtained and properly admitted.

The district court held that the spaces in which defendants parked were not properly marked and that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants each parked a motorcycle in a department store parking lot in an area adjacent to a properly marked handicapped parking space. The areas where defendants parked were triangular and painted in yellow striped patterns. Each defendant was ticketed for parking in the access area of a handicapped parking space in violation of &sect; 11.52.020(25)(b). The trial court and the district court held that the access areas were not marked in conformance with Kan. Stat.

On further review of the questions reserved pursuant to Kan. Stat.

The court held that the definition of access area contained in Wichita, Kan., Code &sect; 11.52.020(25)(b) was not impermissibly vague because a person of ordinary intelligence would have been aware that parking in a clearly marked space adjacent to a duly marked handicapped space was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the trial court's dismissal of defendant's pro se motion for conversion to a guideline sentence under the retroactivity provision of Kan.

The court held that mislabeled pro se motions for sentence conversion under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4724(d) could be properly viewed as Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1507 motions. Where district courts overlooked the jurisdictional issue entirely, appellate courts could review the merits as if the district court properly exercised jurisdiction under &sect; 60-1507. In cases like defendant's, where the district court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction and where defendant's substantive contention raised purely a question of law, a remand was unnecessary. Therefore, the district court incorrectly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Defendant's motion was to be construed as one under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1507.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The real estate developer purchased two subdivisions that contained five categories of property, including vacant lots, rental property and dilapidated residences. The county appraised the property and the developer was successful in its appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals. The Board approved the developer's discount method. The district court concluded that the discount method was a lawful technique for valuing unsold subdivision properties. The appellate court reversed and held that the method violated the uniform and equal basis of valuation required under the state constitution. On appeal, the court held that the method violated the requirements of &sect; 79-1439(a), which required that all real estate be appraised at its fair market value as defined in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-503a. The court noted that a discount method had been approved with regard to unplatted raw ground that was slated for development, but such a method did not apply to a developed subdivision where the lots were marked and streets, curbs, and utilities were in place. The fair market value for a lot in such a subdivision already incorporated the costs of subdivision and the holding costs associated with raw land.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff trust corporation filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, asserting state law claims of negligence and breach of fiduciary duty against defendant savings association. The supreme court certified two questions of law concerning the constitutionality of retroactive legislation, which affected accrued tort actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17-5831 (Supp. 1994) essentially overruled the existing common law in Kansas under which &quot;outside&quot; directors of savings and loan associations could be held liable for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty. The legislature subsequently passed Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 9-1133, 9-1134 (Supp. 1994), which made Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17-5831 (Supp. 1994) applicable to any action that had not been finally adjudicated when &sect; 17-5831 took effect. Several defendants therefore moved for summary judgment. The trust corporation claimed that it had a vested property right under Kansas law in its accrued tort causes of action, and that a retroactive application of &sect; 17-5381 would violate Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 18. The savings association argued that an accrued cause of action was not a vested property right because it was inchoate and afforded no definite or enforceable property right until reduced to final judgment. The court held that the accrual right was a present right that had value, even if not easily measured in dollars. The court ruled that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 9-1133, 9-1134 (Supp. 1994) violated due process and, therefore, violated Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered both certified questions and concluded that the weight of authority rested with the trust corporation. Under Kansas law, its accrued common-law causes of action for negligence and negligent breach of fiduciary duty, which had not yet been reduced to judgment, were &quot;vested property rights.&quot; Further, the court determined that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 9-1133, 9-1134 (Supp. 1994) was unconstitutional under the Kansas Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-2803, a class B misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State, pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3602(b)(3) (Supp. 1994), challenged the judgment on a question reserved by the prosecution and questioned whether the trial court erred by instructing the jury that criminal intent was a required element of the crime of practicing the healing arts without a license. During the trial, the prosecution objected to the trial court's jury instructions and informed the trial court that it wanted to reserve the question of the proof of intent. The court noted that the only question of importance raised by the State was whether the State must prove that the accused had the general intent to violate Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-2803. The right to practice the healing arts was a privilege granted by legislative authority and not a natural right of individuals. The court held that the purpose of &sect; 65-2803 was to protect the public. The public welfare doctrine provided that there was an exception for public welfare offenses regarding the common law rule that required the element of criminal intent. Therefore, the unauthorized practice of the healing arts was an offense that under the public welfare doctrine did not require the element of criminal intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorney general brought an original action in mandamus and quo warranto against respondents, the Secretary of the Kansas Department of Revenue and the Kansas Director of Property Valuation. At issue was the constitutionality of S.B. 542, &sect; 14, 1994 Leg. (Kan. 1994), Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-1427c (1994) and whether it violated the uniform and equal taxation provision of Kan. Const. art. 11, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney general argued that S.B. 542, &sect; 14, 1994 Leg. (Kan. 1994) was a retroactive property tax exemption, which created an improper or preferential classification of property in violation of Kan. Const. Art. 11, &sect; 1, which provided for uniform and equal taxation. It was argued that the newly created tax exemption treated similarly situated taxpayers differently. The court granted the writ of mandamus, held that &sect; 14 was unconstitutional, and severed it from the remainder of the statute. The court determined that &sect; 14 was an unreasonable grant of a tax amnesty or &quot;window of opportunity&quot; based solely on a characteristic or status of the taxpayer rather than upon appropriate classification of the property. Taxpayers were divided into two classes, those who honestly reported their property for taxation and those who did not report their property for taxation or underreported the property if returned. The latter group was granted freedom from taxation and statutory penalties, while the former group was not. Such discrimination, when judged against the taxation guidelines, was arbitrary and lacked the rational basis necessary to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the writ of mandamus in the attorney's action asserting that a statutory section violated the constitutional provision for uniform and equal taxation. The court concluded that the unconstitutional section was separate and independent from the remainder of the statute, and the court severed the unconstitutional section.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the judgment in part, the court held that a lesser-included offense instruction was not warranted because there was no substantial evidence that the lesser offense of an impulse killing had been committed; defendant had armed himself, waited for the victim, and shot at him numerous times. The prosecutor's closing argument remarks, which implied that defendant would commit further crimes if acquitted, were improper, but they did not prejudice defendant because he did not deny that he shot the victim.

Defendant's probation was revoked when she left the program without permission of the court, allegedly because she was barred from attending church. The trial court revoked her probation.

On appeal, the court rejected the State's claim that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over defendant successive petitions, holding that there were no statutory limitations as to the number of grants of probation that could be granted to a defendant. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in revoking her probation because the program was selected by defendant, her attendance was a condition to which she agreed, and the alleged unconstitutional condition was not specifically imposed by the trial court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants questioned the constitutionality of the legislature's action in establishing the Board, whose members were selected by representatives of private organizations, in eliminating the district court review of decisions concerning compensation of injured and disabled workers, and in limiting the review of the court of appeals to questions of law. The statutes in question were Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 44-555b and 4-556. The claimants alleged that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-555b violated the doctrine of separation of powers by authorizing the legislature to usurp the executive power to appoint executive officers. The court held that the power of appointment was not exclusively executive. The fatal flaw in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-555b was not that private entities participated in the selection process, but that they selected the Board. The provisions of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-555b violated Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 1 and were an impermissible delegation of legislative authority. Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 44-551 and 44-556 were not severable from Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-555b.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accused had been charged with two felonies and five misdemeanors resulting from a stop and search of his vehicle by a police officer. A district court services officer filed a bond screen report on the accused. That report was part of the public court file, and it listed the accused's aliases and his prior criminal record. Shortly after the accused's arrest, the newspaper published an article stating that he had been denied bail on the basis of his previous conviction for felony theft. A reporter acquired information for the article from the county attorney. Prior to trial, the accused successfully filed a motion in limine to prevent the State from discussing or introducing evidence of his prior record. The district court also ordered a reporter appearing at the hearing to not report the accused's criminal history or the fact that the district court prohibited publication. The court noted that the district court did not make the requisite findings to issue a valid sua sponte gag order.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff consumer brought a products liability action against defendant manufactures alleging that their products caused his cancer. The Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) ruled that the consumer sufficiently showed a defect, but the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide &amp; Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 136 et seq., preempted his tort claims, and granted summary judgment for the manufacturers. The parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consumer argued that the preemption doctrine did not apply to his common-law damages action. The court held that &sect; 136v(b) of FIFRA preempted the consumer's state tort claims that imposed requirements for the labeling and packaging of the manufacturers' 2,4-D products in addition to or different from FIFRA labeling requirements. Because all failure to warn claims are preempted under FIFRA, the consumer had no claim that survived preemption. The court concluded that the FIFRA provision that preempted state law claims was constitutional, as preemption of state law damages actions was reasonably related to the legitimate interest of uniformity of pesticide labeling and packaging regulations. The court found that the trial court erred in ruling that the consumer's allegation that the manufactures' 2,4-D products caused cancer was sufficient to raise a claim of design defect. The consumer could not prevail on a strict liability design defect claim without identifying what aspect of the manufacturers' products was defectively designed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fireman was employed by the city for a period of over 24 years prior to his retirement and participated in the city's pension plan. A dispute developed over how his monthly pension benefit was calculated, so fireman filed suit against the city, alleging that the city was liable for breach of contract and for taking his property without due process of law in violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The trial court found that the fireman's pension payment was at least equal to that required by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-14a08 and that the fireman failed to prove his 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim. On appeal, the court noted that it was called upon to review the trial court's interpretation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-14a08 and the retirement contract to determine whether the trial court correctly determined the monthly pension due the fireman. The court found that under the fact of the case, the formula that the city ultimately decided on for calculating the fireman's monthly pension was a unilateral modification of the fireman's pension but that the change was a reasonable one. The court concluded that the change in the pension plan made by the city did not result in a disadvantage to the employee.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court noted that it had jurisdiction to review the BOTA determination under the Act for Judicial Review and Civil Enforcement of Agency Actions, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-2426(c). The court held that the taxpayer failed to sustain its burden of proving that BOTA's actions were invalid. The taxpayer waived its objection to the number of officers who conducted the hearing and participated in the decision. It did not object or request substitutes for the two members who failed to complete the hearing. Nor did the taxpayer show an arbitrary disregard of the undisputed evidence or some extrinsic consideration such as bias, passion, or prejudice. The assessment validly was made in reliance upon the cost method, considering actual construction costs, and did not vary greatly from the taxpayer's appraisal. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The Shawnee District Court (Kansas) upheld the constitutionality of the act with the exception of its provisions regarding the low enrollment weighting factor in its classification scheme, and the school districts, taxpayers, and students filed an interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature enacted legislation requiring each local school board to levy a tax on property in its district, deposit the funds into its general fund, and remit any excess funds to the state for use in funding public education in poorer districts. The school districts, taxpayers, and students claimed that the act violated Kan Const. art. VI, &sect; 6(b) because it did not make suitable financial provision for public education. They also claimed that the act's classification scheme violated the equal protection principles in Kan. Const. Bill of Rights &sect; 1 and that the act's recapture provision violated the Takings Clause of U.S. Const. amend. V, XIV. The court held that the legislation was constitutional. In so holding, the court found that (1) the legislation made suitable provision for education under the standards set by the state department of education; (2) the classification scheme of the legislation was rationally related to legitimate state interests; and (3) the requirement that the wealthier districts remit excess funds to the state did not violate the Takings Clause because all taxpayers benefitted from the quality of the education received by students in the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was shot several times after she was robbed. The State charged defendant with aggravated robbery and attempted first-degree murder. The trial court instructed the jury that it could convict defendant of attempted first-degree murder if it found the shooting was intentional, deliberate, premeditated, and with intent to kill, or if the shooting occurred during the commission or attempted commission of an aggravated robbery. The jury returned a general verdict of guilty to attempted first-degree murder (and aggravated robbery), but it did not indicate whether it relied on the premeditation or felony-murder theory. On appeal, the court held that the attempted felony-murder instruction was clearly erroneous because Kansas did not recognize attempted felony murder. Moreover, the attempted felony-murder instruction erroneously diminished the State's burden to prove a specific intent to kill required for attempted first-degree murder. The instruction and general verdict form did not require the jury to unanimously find defendant intended to commit premeditated murder. Thus, a legally erroneous ground for the conviction could have been the basis for the jury's finding of guilt.</SPAN></P>

The case was transferred after the appellate court questioned the board's jurisdiction because the employee had filed to request a review of the ALJ's award by the board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injury occurred when the employee was struck in the back of his head and his neck by a large chunk of asphalt as he was working on a water main. The court reasoned that prior to an amendment to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-551, seeking review by the director was not a prerequisite to judicial review of the ALJ's award. However, the court held that &sect; 44-551 was amended to provide that all acts, findings, awards, decisions, rulings, or modifications of findings or awards made by an ALJ were subject to review by the board upon written request of any interested party within 10 days, and if no such request was made, the board was required to approve the actions, findings, awards, decisions, rulings, or modifications of findings or awards of the ALJ. The court held that review by the board was a prerequisite to judicial review as provided for in &sect; 44-556. Therefore, the court concluded that an appellate court had no jurisdiction to consider an appeal from an order of the board when no written request for review of the decision of the ALJ had been filed as required by Kan.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board entered an emergency order temporarily suspending the physician's license and directing him to submit to a mental examination. The emergency order was based upon psychiatric evidence concerning his ability to care for his patients.

The physician filed an action against defendants, seeking relief in the nature of a mandamus compelling the Board to afford him a hearing on the emergency suspension. The trial court upheld the suspension of the physician's license. The trial court denied the physician's claim for damages, but awarded him attorney fees against the Board. On appeal, the court found that the issuance of the emergency suspension order was consistent with both the provisions of the Kansas Healing Arts Act and the provisions of the Kansas Administrative Procedure Act. The court further found that the Board's denial of a hearing on the issue of suspension denied the physician due process of law.

The court found that the focus of appellee's claim was that as a classified civil service employee, he held a right not to be terminated without a hearing and without good cause. The court found that he would not have had these rights but for the Kansas Civil Service Act (KCSA), Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-2925 et seq. The court held that appellee's wrongful termination action clearly relied on the KCSA to provide the basis of liability he sought to impose on appellant. The court found that appellee's breach of employment contract claim was an action &quot;upon a liability created by a statute&quot; and consequently must have been filed within three years of his termination pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-512(2). The court reversed the decision of the trial court because appellee's claim was time barred.</SPAN></P>

It paid one year's taxes and protested the next two years' levy. Its protests were before the Board of Tax Appeals when it instituted its suit for an injunction. The trial court declared the Act unconstitutional in part because the taxpayer, as the entity paying the largest portion of the assessments, did not receive notice and due process. It impounded the protested tax payments. On appeal, the court held that the Act was not constitutionally defective. It held that the notice required under the Fourteenth Amendment in a condemnation action was not applicable in a situation involving assessments. It noted that the taxpayer was not entitled to a freeze on the disbursement of the taxes it paid under protest. It held further that the taxpayer had not exhausted its administrative remedies before the Board with regard to its tax protests and the authority of the improvement district to assess its tangible property.

The trial court granted some of the department's motions for summary judgment and both parties appealed from the decision. The reviewing court found the administrator was precluded from bringing the action against the department and thus their cause of action for abuse of process was tolled. The department conceded the malicious prosecution claim was not barred by the statute of limitations. Finally, the reviewing court found the civil rights claim was proper because the governmental agency did not have a discretionary right to violate a legal duty and avoid liability.

The patient alleged that the hospital was liable for damages because it permitted the surgeon to operate in its facilities. The court held that the hospital was statutorily protected from liability for damages arising from the negligence of the surgeon, who was an independent contractor, not an employee of the hospital. Kan. Stat. 65-442(b) eliminated health care facility liability for licensed surgeons who were not employees of the facility. Further, the Health Care Provider Insurance Availability Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-3401 et seq., provided immunity to health care providers covered by the Health Care Stabilization Fund (Fund) from vicarious liability for damages arising from services rendered by other health care providers covered by the Fund. Because the surgeon and the facility both were covered by the Fund, the court found that the lower courts had properly dismissed the patient's cause of action against the hospital.

Defendant was not denied his statutory speedy trial right, pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3402(1), because the continuances were properly charged to him. The State's use of two peremptory challenges to exclude males from the jury was proper because there were valid reasons other than gender that justified excusing the jurors.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A disabled minor fell into a closed swimming pool at a mobile home park and nearly drowned. After he filed a lawsuit, the district court granted summary judgment to the park operators and the fence company, and the jury found the corporate owner of the park two percent negligent. On appeal, the court affirmed the summary judgment to the fence company because Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-3303(b)(1) barred the claim. Further, the fence company had no duty to warn because the danger or hazard was open or obvious and should have been realized by a reasonable user of the product. The court reversed the summary judgment to the operators because they had either assumed or assigned their duty to pump accumulated water from the pool to an agent of the corporation. They had a responsibility to act and failed to act, and they owed a duty to the disabled minor. The district court erred in admitting collateral source benefits evidence. The denial of the corporation's summary judgment and directed verdict motions was affirmed because the disabled minor's status as a trespasser did not preclude submission to the jury of the negligence per se claim based on two ordinances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the State of Kansas, sought review of a decision by the Court of Appeals (Kansas) that affirmed the trial court's order in an interlocutory appeal challenging the trial court's granting of appellee defendant's motion to suppress certain evidence, finding that the police acted outside of their jurisdiction in executing the search warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the suppression hearing, it was undisputed that police officers from an outside city, executed a search warrant in the forum city without any request for assistance by the officers of the forum city. The state contended that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-2505, a statute specifically dealing with the execution of search warrants, was not limited by the general geographical limitations of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-401(a). The court ruled that &sect; 22-401 was controlling. The court reasoned that while Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-2505 admittedly applied only to the execution of search warrants, the language of that statute simply could not be read as an exception to the clear geographic limitation set forth in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-2401(a). The court reasoned that &sect; 22-2401(a) as the later enacted statute prevailed. The court held that &sect; 22-2401(a) was the more specific statute and that when there was a territorial limitation placed upon law enforcement officers, that limitation was controlling. The court concluded that the outside officers lacked jurisdiction because they failed to meet one of the two exceptions under &sect; 22-2401, which would permit them to exercise power outside of their jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

There was no duty to instruct on a lesser offense of robbery because the evidence clearly showed that a greater offense, aggravated robbery, occurred. The record had to show, either expressly or by implication, that the trial judge who enhanced defendant's sentence because of false testimony found his false testimony negatively affected defendant's capacity for rehabilitation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was injured in an accident at work in which he came into contact with caustic chemicals. The patient alleged that the hospital was negligent in its failure to ascertain the nature of his chemical exposure in time to minimize the injuries. Prior to trial, the patient entered into settlement agreements with other defendants, including his employer and the employer's plant nurse. The hospital challenged the sufficiency of the patient's notice of appeal. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case for a new trial. Under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-102, the patient's notice of appeal was sufficient to include the issues stated in his appellate brief and the hospital was not surprised or disadvantaged by the issues that the patient briefed. A new trial was warranted because the trial court erred in its admission of the settlement agreements and the patient's workers compensation award, which were prejudicial to the patient under Kan.

The district court ordered that defendant was to serve 90 days of imprisonment by home incarceration that was to be followed by probation because it determined that the penalty provision of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3405b constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court reversed the district court's judgment. Section 21-3405b(b)(2) provided that a defendant was not eligible for probation until he served at least 90 days of imprisonment. Even though the home incarceration statute,&nbsp;Kan. Stat.

The penalty for vehicular battery required that defendant serve time in prison, not by home incarceration.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate did not fall within the Act and was not eligible to have his controlling sentence modified because of the severity level of his crime of aggravated robbery. He contended that his exclusion from the retroactivity provision of the Act was the result of an arbitrary classification which bore no relationship to the purpose of the retroactivity legislation and thus, violated equal protection. The court determined that as the dispositive question was whether the sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional, the appropriate review standard was whether there was a rational basis for the classification. Applying this standard, the court concluded that the limited retroactivity provision of the Act did not clearly violate the constitutional right to equal protection as there was no suspect class or fundamental right involved. The retroactivity provision was valid in that it was reasonably related to the legitimate objective of reducing prison population while maintaining public safety. The court also found that the limited retroactivity provision was reasonable in relation to its subject, was adopted in the interest of the community, and was not violative of due process.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the count of official misconduct arising from statements made by defendant to the two witnesses involved U.S. Const. amend. I rights. The court held that the government regulation of speech was prohibited except in certain narrowly limited classes of speech. The court found that &sect; 21-3902 did not specifically enumerate the types of misconduct prohibited and that misconduct was a general term that was unconstitutionally vague.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Congress enacted the Railroad Revitalization &amp; Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 11503 (4-R Act), to prohibit discriminatory taxation of railroad property by state and local tax laws. Litigation under the 4-R Act resulted in several consent decrees, one of which fixed the railroads' assessment rate for real property for 1990 and 1991. The public utilities sought to have their properties assessed on the same bases as railroad property for those years. The DPV and the BOTA denied the requests. On review, the court held that the BOTA order did not violate the uniform and equal provision of Kan. Const. art. 11, &sect; 1(b) (amended 1992) where the 4-R Act preempted the state classification of railroads and where limiting the presumption of the 4-R Act to its purposes and application resulted in minimal interference with the classification system under Kan. Const. art. 11, &sect; 1(b) (amended 1992). The court also held that the BOTA order did not violate equal protection where Kan. Const. art. 11, &sect; 1(b) (amended 1992) treated all public utility property alike and where the 4-R Act preempted the classification only as to railroad property.</SPAN></P>

In the ensuing action, the jury did not access punitive damages against the employer, awarded punitive damages against the employee and the corporation in a survival action by the administrator, but denied punitive damages for the wrongful death actions. The court affirmed the constitutionality of Kan. Stat.

Further, a wrongful death action was a statutory creature, and Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1901 did not contemplate punitive damages. The court reversed and remanded the lower court's punitive award decision and held that admissible and relevant evidence of the employer's and corporation's authorization and ratification conduct, which affected the substantial rights of the administrator and heirs, was improperly excluded by the lower court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After finding defendant guilty of the premeditated first degree murder of his wife, the jury found that defendant, under Kan.

Defendant appealed, arguing that his absence during the pathologist's deposition violated his constitutional right of confrontation. He also argued that the aggravating circumstance, which formed the bases for his hard 40 sentence, was unconstitutionally vague. On appeal, the court reversed on the witness confrontation issue and remanded the case for a new trial. The court held that the unavailability of the pathologist was not explicitly shown, that the basis for the trial court's declaration of unavailability was absent from the record, and that the reliability and trustworthiness of the deposition was in doubt because the pathologist did not sign the deposition. The court concluded that it was unable to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the admission of the deposition testimony had little, if any, likelihood of changing the result at trial. The court also provided new instruction language for the hard 40 sentencing proceeding under &sect; 21-4635(6).</SPAN></P>

The injured victim argued on appeal, that application of OPLA was error because the legislation was improperly enacted under Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 14 and therefore was void. The court agreed with the injured victim. The court pointed out that a bill never became law until the constitutional prerequisites pertaining to the manner of enactment had been fully complied with. The court noted that the version of OPLA that was signed by the governor was not the same version that was passed by both houses of the legislature, which violated Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 14.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The recipients filed a class action.

According to the court, the proposed changes were reasonably expected to be in furtherance of the optimum utilization of public assistance funds. The court noted that the new GA requirements provided a rough method of identifying those who were unable to provide for their own basic needs. The court also determined that the Secretary's action in seeking to eliminate or substantially reduce cash and medical assistance to certain members of the class did not violate the equal protection guarantees of the Kansas and United States Constitutions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In both actions, the Board sought to enforce tax liens on certain parcels of property. In each instance, the Board filed an order approving apportionment of costs, charges, and expenses. The orders set forth the Board's methodology of cost, expense, and balance allocation pursuant to &sect; 79-2803. When the owners challenged the method of allocation, the district court developed its own version. In their cross-appeals, the owners argued that excessive and improper costs were included in the district court's allocation. The Board argued that the district court's allocation was inequitable. On review, the court determined that in both instances, the Board failed to show that the allocation method adopted by the court was contrary to &sect; 79-2803. However, all filing and docketing fees paid in excess of $ 65 were improper and should not have been included in the allocation of costs because the petitions seeking tax foreclosure constituted one case for each of the owners. While the foreclosure was sought on multiple parcels, each petition constituted one case. Finally, it was proper for the district court to set aside the sale of one parcel because the owner was not properly served.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The additional tax resulted principally from the use of the domestic combination method of apportioning income and expenses for the corporation, which was multijurisdictional, and the treatment of foreign dividends as apportionable income. The corporation contended that it had been denied due process by the department's changing tax rules and policies without issuing regulations. The corporation further argued that the department's treatment of foreign dividends was improper because the dividends were treated under the domestic combination method, which was contrary to Kan.

The evidence showed that there was no change in the department's treatment of foreign dividends during the tax years that were in contention. Thus, the denial of due process claim was meritless. Additionally, the department's treatment of foreign dividends was proper because the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act, Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the complaint because it failed to allege an essential element of the offense, which was intent. The question presented on appeal was whether the complaint was fatally defective by failing to specifically allege intent. The city asserted that defendant waived any objection to defects in the complaint because he did not raise them before trial. The court found this contention was without merit. The city also contended that Overland Park, Kan. Municipal Code &sect; 11.56.140 (1986) created absolute liability for the offense of possession of marijuana. Thus, the city contended that there was no requirement that the complaint allege intent. The court found no legislative intent for the imposition of absolute liability in the adoption of the ordinance. However, the court found that possession of marijuana under the Overland Park Municipal Code was a general intent crime, and that the charging language of the ordinance was sufficient to state an offense. Thus, the court held that the trial court erred by dismissing the complaint on the basis that it failed to state an offense by omission of the word intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission found that the racetrack manager, who was involved in gambling activities, was not qualified to perform his duties under Kan.

The Commission revoked his occupation license, fined him, and permanently excluded him from the track. The Commission's order was affirmed by the trial court. On appeal, the court affirmed the revocation of his license as it was supported by substantial evidence. The court also affirmed his exclusion from the track. The court held that the statutes and regulations were not unconstitutionally vague. However, the court concluded that the notice of the charges was insufficient and facially inadequate when compared to the regulatory violations found by the Commission, and the court vacated the order as it related to those violations and fines. As a matter of law, the Commission and the trial court had incorrectly applied the regulations in question to the facts of the case. The manager's conduct was not a violation of either of the regulations.</SPAN></P>

He appealed from the judgment of the Sedgwick County District Court (Kansas), arguing, inter alia, that his counsel was ineffective and his rights to self-representation and to be present at trial were denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The crimes involved two incidents in which mature women whom defendant knew were strangled to death in their apartments. There were no signs of forced entry and property was missing. In the first incident, the Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) of seminal fluid matched defendant's DNA. In the second incident, there was not sufficient seminal fluid to conduct a DNA test, but defendant's hair was consistent with a hair found at the scene. The court held that defendant's counsel was not ineffective, despite the claim that there was a communication problem. Counsel and defendant frequently conferred with one another. Defendant's request to serve as co-counsel indicated that he did not want to represent himself; nor was he constitutionally entitled to serve as co-counsel. Defendant waived his right to be present at trial. His poor relationship with counsel did not render his absence involuntary. The motion to sever the charges was properly denied. The lapse of four years and the differing ages of the victims did not make the crimes dissimilar. Evidence of the first incident was admissible to establish identity in the second incident. The evidence supported the mandatory 40-year sentence.</SPAN></P>

A verdict was returned in appellees' favor, but the trial court applied a damages cap pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-19a02 (1992 Supp.). The trial court denied appellant's motion for a new trial. Both sides appealed, and the court affirmed. Appellant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the award of future medical expenses and future loss of income. When a verdict was attacked on the ground that it was contrary to the evidence, it was not the court's function to weight the evidence of pass on the credibility of the witnesses. Because the evidence, with all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, when considered in the light most favorable to appellees, supported the verdict, the court would not disturb the verdict.

Defendant, who walked a route on the opposite side of the street and directed his message at all persons traversing the road, was not engaged in conduct prohibited by the ordinance.

On review, the court reversed and found that the dependents' right of action was derivative of and dependent upon the employee's contract of employment. It existed because of the employee-employer relationship. The statute discriminated against a class of employees based on their dependents' alienage. The benefit limitation applied only to dependents who were nonresident aliens; however, nonresident United States citizens were entitled to the same benefits as resident citizens and resident aliens. Classifications based on alienage, with respect to resident aliens, were suspect and subject to strict scrutiny. The statute was unconstitutional and violated the Equal Protection Clauses of both the Kansas and the United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

Three clerks chased them outside, and one clerk was killed when defendant ran over her and dragged her under the van for 500 feet. He challenged the jury instruction regarding the intent requirement for a charge of second degree murder as well as the sufficiency of the evidence and certain evidentiary rulings. The court noted that the jury instruction specifically stated that the presumption of intent could be rejected but at no time did the burden of proof ever shift to defendant. The instruction was constitutionally valid. The court found there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict. The State was permitted to introduce gruesome photographs of the victim to show the extent of her injuries that caused her death. The trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury that vehicular homicide was a lesser included offense when it instructed on the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter. Under certain narrow factual situations such as defendant's where wanton misconduct or gross negligence was a part of the charge, vehicular homicide was not a lesser included offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee insured brought an action against appellant insurer claiming underinsured motorist benefits. Prior to trial, the district court ruled that the Collateral Source Benefits Act (Act), Kan. Stat.

A jury found in favor of plaintiff, and appellant sought review of the verdict and district court's rulings. The court affirmed the judgment of the district court, holding that the Act was unconstitutional on equal protection grounds, because it failed to pass the rational basis test. The classification of plaintiffs by the size of their demands, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-3802, was not relevant to a legitimate state objective. In addition, the court held that &sect; 60-3802, was not severable from the Act, and the entire Act was therefore void. Classification was not a separate and independent provision, because to eliminate the classification would have changed the entire scheme of the Act. The invalidity of &sect; 60-3802 affected the remainder of the Act because, absent the invalid provision, the intent of the legislature would not have been carried out.</SPAN></P>

It held that the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant as charged because it showed a brutal assault on a helpless victim. Furthermore, the 40-year minimum sentence had been imposed in compliance with Kan. Stat.

Defendant had failed to preserve his objection to testimony about his lack of remorse. The court found that Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties' settlement agreement on alimony was incorporated into their divorce decree. The ex-husband fell into arrears on his alimony payments and failed to make a lump sum payment required by the trial court. The ex-wife filed an accusation in contempt. The trial court issued a bench warrant when the ex-husband failed to appear before the trial court to answer a contempt citation and show cause order. The ex-husband was arrested on the bench warrant. On appeal, the court disagreed with the ex-husband that the alimony was only contractual in nature and that the ex-husband was unconstitutionally imprisoned for his failure to pay a debt. Through incorporation into the divorce decree, the alimony agreement became a judgment rather than just a contractual agreement. The court determined that contempt proceedings were a proper method to enforce alimony. The court concluded that summary judgment was properly granted to the ex-wife as she did not cause the false arrest and imprisonment of the ex-husband but only informed the trial court of the circumstances as she perceived them and left it to the trial court to take whatever action the trial court deemed proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order from the Johnson District Court (Kansas), which convicted him for aggravated kidnapping, rape, aggravated sodomy, and aggravated assault. Defendant was committed to a State hospital, but nine years later he was returned to the trial court for sentencing pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3431.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant assigned a number of errors, including a claim that he was mentally competent at the time of trial and sentencing based on his psychiatric problems. The court disagreed, noting that the trial court had ample opportunity to observe his conduct and demeanor at trial, but found him competent. Moreover, the court rejected his contention that his psychotropic medication deemed his competency invalid because it was synthetically produced. With regard to his competency at sentencing, it was proper to release him for sentencing when the hospital found that defendant no longer benefited from the treatment, even where they opined that he was dangerous. The court found that the weight and sufficiency of evidence supported the conviction, and the jury was justified to find that he was not insane under the M'Naghten test. The court determined that, although the instructions might have been worded better, they did not unconstitutionally shift the burden of proof to defendant. However, the court agreed with defendant's contention that the three counts of aggravated assault were multiplicitous with his convictions for aggravated kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, except as to the count for aggravated assault, which was reversed. The case was remanded with directions to vacate the sentence imposed on that count.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A due process hearing was held after the teacher was advised of the district's intent not to renew his contract. The hearing committee held the district did not show good cause to not renew the teacher's contract. The district court concluded it was not bound by the committee's decision because &sect; 72-5443 removed from the local school board the authority to make a final decision of whether a teacher's contract should be renewed and that it violated Kan. Const. art. 6, &sect;&sect; 2, 5. The court reversed and remanded. The court held the district was entitled to appeal the committee's decision under Kan. Stat.

The court concluded that the powers of the committee did not unconstitutionally impinge on the state board of education's general supervisory authority, and that the hiring and firing of teachers was not a duty of the state board of education.

His confession in an interview eight hours after he arrived at the police station was properly admitted. The delay in interviewing him did not affect its voluntariness. Evidence of his gang membership was properly admitted as part of the offenses' res gestae. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit evidence of defendant's prior sexual relationship with the rape victim because there was no claim of consensual sexual relations on the night in question. Demonstrative photographs of the murder victim, which were true reproductions of relevant physical facts and material conditions, were admissible even though they were gruesome and shocking. Small errors in the instructions did not constitute reversible error because the instructions as a whole could not have reasonably misled the jury. The heinous, atrocious, and cruel aggravating factor was not unconstitutionally vague, and its imposition was supported by evidence of the lengthy assault and slow death of the murder victim that was stomped to death. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the state failed to make a prima facie showing of the corpus delicti for the homicide for each of the three murder charges. The essence of his argument was that the circumstantial evidence presented was insufficient. The court held that the corpus delicti for homicide on each of the three counts of murder was established. The court reasoned that in viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, it was clear the state established a pattern of behavior and that a rational factfinder could have found that defendant entered the victims' apartments with keys he had acquired, surprised them, and threatened them with a gun or knife. The court also held that: 1) jurisdiction was proper in Kansas; 2) the evidence was sufficient to sustain the murder all the convictions; 3) defendant's claims concerning the multiplicity were unfounded; 4) defendant's truck was abandoned and that therefore, defendant had no expectation of privacy in its regard; and 5) that the enhancement of defendant's sentence was improper it was not established that the underlying offense had been committed after a judgment of conviction on a prior offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant contended that the property at issue was his homestead and was protected from forfeiture by Kan.

Ann. &sect; 65-4135(a)(7)(A) (Supp. 1991), which provided that the claimant of a homestead who had been convicted of a violation of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act was presumed to have consented to the forfeiture of the homestead by committing the violation. The claimant contended that the homestead exemption was a constitutional right not subject to legislative intrusion, and argued that the legislature lacked authority to limit the homestead exemption. The court concluded that the court of appeals correctly held that the forfeiture of the claimant's real property was a forced sale in violation of Kan. Const. art. 15, &sect; 9. The court noted that Kan. Const. art. 15, &sect; 9 specifically provided for three exceptions to the homestead exemption, and that forfeiture was not one of them. Moreover, Kansas had zealously protected the family rights in homestead property by liberally construing the homestead provision in order to safeguard its humanitarian and soundly social and economic purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim's wife was defendant's lover. Defendant's keys and his fingerprint were found in a search of a rental car that they returned after the victim had been shot.

After conducting two suppression hearings and hearing the trial testimony, the trial court found no evidence that defendant had been deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way when he made statements to detectives. The trial court did not err in determining that the interview was not a custodial interrogation. The State's use of a peremptory challenge to strike a prospective white juror who voiced concern about the absence of minorities on the jury panel was not race-based. Defendant had no standing to exclude evidence seized from another's home. Reversing the restitution, the court said that the State conceded that the trial court failed to follow Kan. Stat.

The court held that the doctrine of necessaries in its historical form violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution because historically the doctrine was applied to husbands only. The court ruled that before a creditor could seek payment from a spouse, the creditor must first pursue collection from the person who received the necessary goods or services.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon the father's motion for reduction of child support, the trial court appointed an administrative hearing officer (AHO) to conduct an expedited hearing pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20-164 (Supp. 1991) and Kan. Sup. Ct. R. 172. The AHO reduced the father's monthly child support obligation, and the trial court affirmed his order. Upon review, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion. The court held that upon a showing of changes in the father's earnings, the trial court had the authority to modify the previous child support order under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1610(b)(3) (Supp. 1991). The court held that expedited judicial process did not violate the mother's due process rights by not providing for a de novo trial of the AHO's order by the trial court. The court held that the mother received notice, a reasonable hearing, and judicial review. The court held that because the father failed to brief on appeal the issue of the AHO's acceptance as evidence of the mother's exhibits that had not been provided to him prior to the hearing, the issue was deemed abandoned.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion to discharge the jury panel on the grounds that the procedure for selecting the prospective jurors from voter registration lists violated his right to a fair and impartial jury trial. The court ruled that a challenge based on alleged discrimination in the selection of a jury necessarily required a showing that a recognizable identifiable class of persons, otherwise entitled to be jury members, was purposefully and systematically excluded from jury service. Further, the court held that a group of persons who choose not to vote did not constitute a cognizable group because their non-registration was a result of their own inaction not a result of affirmative conduct by others to bar their registration. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the judgment, concluding that defendant failed to establish a prima facie case that the jury panel systematically or purposefully excluded a cognizable group such as blacks or minorities as a whole.</SPAN></P>

The employee sought review and contended that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-510d(a)(23) (1991 Supp.) violated the equal protection clause because it differentiated between repetitive and single injuries. Under &sect; 44-510d, whenever the employee was entitled to compensation for repetitive use conditions occurring in opposite upper extremities, the compensation was to be computed as separate scheduled injuries and the percentage was to be increased by 20 percent of the determined loss. The court held that, the determination of whether a right was a fundamental interest was whether the right asserted was explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the constitution. Because the statute had not affected a fundamental right, the rational basis test was to be applied in determining equal protection rights. The court held that the statute discriminated between repetitive and single injuries and failed to pass the rational basis test. The court found that it was unconstitutional.

The court agreed and affirmed the judgment. The court held that judicial immunity applied even when a judge was accused of acting maliciously and corruptly, though the privilege was not for the protection or benefit of a malicious or corrupt judge, but for the benefit of the public, whose interest it was that the judges should be at liberty to exercise their functions with independence and without fear of consequences.

Defendant alleged that plaintiff's claim was barred by the statute of limitations. The district court denied defendant's motion for summary judgment, and defendant filed an interlocutory appeal. The court affirmed and remanded the case for further proceedings, holding that the applicable statute of limitations was the statute in effect at the time the action was filed, Kan. Stat.

The retroactive provision of &sect; 60-3303(e), which revived actions prohibited by the two-year statute of limitations for tort actions, Kan. Stat.

Furthermore, under Kansas law, defendant's conviction of aggravated robbery did not depend on his being armed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Attorneys sought to recover money damages for legal services rendered under the court-appointed system prior to July 1, 1988. In the trial court the State filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that a prior decision of the court on the matter was res judicata and that the attorneys' action based upon claims of inverse condemnation and unjust enrichment failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted. The trial court granted summary judgment to the State after having adopted these arguments set forth by the State. On appeal, the court determined that that the trial court had properly found that the court's prior decision on the matter was to be applied prospectively only, beginning July 1, 1988. The court concluded that its decision in a prior case, which found the indigent defense services system then in effect to be unconstitutional as then applied, had prospective application only as to legal services rendered after July 1, 1988.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers argued that appellees used the county average tax from two years prior rather than one year prior to calculate motor vehicle taxes. Because of this, the motor vehicle tax was higher than it would have been had the prior year's county average tax been used. The taxpayers filed suit to recover the excess motor vehicle tax they paid. The district court dismissed their suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based upon the taxpayers' failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The taxpayers appealed and the court affirmed. The court found that the taxpayers' claim for recovery of the motor vehicle registration tax was an attempt to seek tax relief without first complying with Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-2005 (1991). Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 79-2005 (1991), and 74-2426 (1991) provided the taxpayers with a clear and certain remedy for complete and adequate relief and, therefore, had to be complied with before resorting to the courts.

Const. art. 6, &sect; 2 because it neither reduced the Board's supervisory authority by delegating any part thereof to another entity nor did it require the Board to do or not do anything. Further, to hold that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-1383 conflicted with Kan. Admin. Regs. 91-1-61 would improperly repeal Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-1383 by implication. Moreover, the teaching profession had justification for the discipline of a person within it ranks who committed a felony, and there was a least a presumption that the teacher's felonious conduct had a sufficient nexus to fitness to teach to warrant the action by the Board. Additionally, there was no right to privacy involved in the commission of a burglary. Finally, adequate notice, that felonious conduct was prohibited and within the meaning of the &sect; 72-1383 term &quot;immorality,&quot; was present and defeated any claim of vagueness.</SPAN></P>

A urine test was ordered, which showed the presence of marijuana. The State filed a petition to revoke her probation based upon the arrest and the lab results. The trial court dismissed the petition, holding that the revocation proceeding was premature because the criminal charges were unresolved. It also held that the lab results and the technician's affidavit were inadmissible because they were hearsay. The court held that the revocation petition was proper, even though the criminal charges were unresolved, because the standard of proof in the revocation proceeding was lower than that of a criminal prosecution.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3434 and therefore a closed-circuit procedure was proper. The court had remanded his conviction of aggravated incest, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3603.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court had put the burden on the State to prove that the closed circuit procedure was necessary. The State showed a video tape of the child answering questions when defendant was not present and contrasted an appearance of apprehension when he was present. The court affirmed the conviction, but the United States Supreme Court vacated and remanded it. The court remanded the case to the trial court, which held a non-evidentiary hearing. The trial judge relied on his own impressions and observations of the child. There was no evidence or testimony by any psychologist or mental health expert. The court ruled that although there was no specific evidentiary hearing, review of the record reflected all the procedural safeguards to ensure defendant's constitutional right of confrontation were present. The court explained that the legislature determined that the closed circuit procedure was appropriate for any child under 13 years old but, in accordance with the Court's interpretation of the Sixth Amendment, an individualized finding of clear and convincing evidence that testifying in defendant's presence would traumatize the child so that she was unable to communicate was required.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found each party 50 percent at fault and awarded no damages. The appellate court reversed in part and affirmed in part. On appeal, the court affirmed the appellate court as modified. The insurer was not bound by the agreement between the insured and the underinsured driver. There must be a trial to apportion the fault between the two drivers to determine if the insured's damages exceeded the limits of the underinsured's automobile liability insurance limits. Once notified of an action, if the insurer elected not to intervene, the insurer was bound by a judgment obtained in the action. The trial court did err in refusing to instruct the jury that it was unlawful to drive faster than 35 mph at the site of the collision because there was sufficient evidence to support the insured's negligence per se argument and the instructions given did not adequately cover the theory.</SPAN></P>

The horseback riders contended that the regulation curtailed their fundamental right to travel and violated their equal protection and due process rights. On review, the court found that, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19-2868(g), the Board had authority to adopt, promulgate, and enforce reasonable rules and regulations for the operation of parks. Preventing accidents and reducing the seriousness of accidents on public roadways was a legitimate governmental interest and limiting traffic on public roadways to exclude animal traffic was a valid exercise of the Board's police power. Moreover, all equestrians were treated alike, and the distinct characteristics of horses presented a justifiable reason for creating a separate regulation based upon health and safety concerns. Thus, applying the rational basis test, the Board's regulation was reasonably related to the government's legitimate objective and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The expert testimony was insufficient to establish that the delay in testing or referral had probably caused or contributed to the victim's deterioration in physical condition or the loss of his kidney. The testimony fell far short of the degree of medical probability or certainty required to support the necessary element of causation. Without expert testimony that the alleged negligence of the physicians had been the proximate cause of the patient's injury, the trial court was correct in granting summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers, who were all retirees of the military, challenged a judgment of the Shawnee District Court (Kansas), which entered summary judgment in favor of defendant State of Kansas in the taxpayers' &sect; 1983 class action. The trial court found that the Kansas Income Tax Act (KITA), Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3201 et seq., as applied to military retirement pay, was constitutional and did not violate 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 111.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly after the United States Supreme Court held that a Michigan statute imposing a state income tax on retirement benefits of federal civil service retirees, while exempting retirement benefits of State retirees, violated the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity, the subject class action suits were filed, challenging KITA. KITA taxed federal military retirement benefits, but exempted retirement benefits received by State and local government retirees. The taxpayers claimed that KITA discriminated against federal military retirees and, therefore, violated 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 111 (1988), intergovernmental tax immunity, the privileges and immunities clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and Kan. Const. art. 11, &sect; 2. The taxpayers all paid Kansas income taxes on federal military retirement pay. The court held that military retirement pay was reduced current compensation for reduced current services and that KITA was constitutional under principles of intergovernmental tax immunity and under Kan. Const. art II, &sect; 2. The court further held that the discriminatory tax bore a reasonable relationship to the subject taxed and that the tax was not arbitrary or capricious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the State Reception and Diagnostic Center (SRDC) recommended a modification of defendant's sentence for an aggravated sexual battery conviction, defendant moved for modification of his sentence under Kan.

Defendant appealed. In reversing and remanding for reconsideration of defendant's motion, the court concluded that &sect; 21-4603 was constitutional and did not violate the separation of powers doctrine. The statute did not unnecessarily or unconstitutionally restrict the discretionary power of a district court, which had the discretion to reject an SRDC recommendation for modification when both the safety of the public would be jeopardized and the welfare of defendant would not be served by the modification. The SRDC merely made recommendations; the final determination rested with the district court, which was to consider not only the SRDC recommendation but other sentencing factors as well.</SPAN></P>

The doctor petitioned for judicial review in the district court pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-621(c). The district court upheld the Board's decision. Upon review, the court affirmed the judgment. Although the legislature did not promulgate specific guidelines for the Board to follow when making a decision on a petition for reinstatement, the court held that the Act anticipated that the Board would consider the grounds for revoking the license as well as the stated purpose of the Act. Thus, the court determined that the Board considered all of the evidence and, after doing so, concluded that reinstatement was inappropriate; therefore, the Board did not act arbitrarily or capriciously when it refused to reinstate the doctor's license.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner challenged the judgment of the Court of Appeals (Kansas), which affirmed a trial court order denying petitioner's application for a writ of habeas corpus and permitted petitioner's extradition to Alabama. Petitioner contended that the trial court erred in denying his application because the facts did not prove he was a fugitive from justice under Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought review of the appellate court's decision affirming the trial court's order denying petitioner's writ application. He had been arrested in Kansas based on criminal charges in Alabama and sought a writ to preclude his extradition to Alabama under the Kansas Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-2701 et seq., after his extradition to Alabama was demanded by the Alabama governor. Petitioner asserted that it had not been established that he was a fugitive from justice as required by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-2702 and that the extradition documents were framed under an alternative statute, thereby denying petitioner the gubernatorial discretion which was his due process right under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-2706. The court on appeal reversed the judgments of both the appellate and trial courts based on its determination that petitioner's extradition erroneously proceeded under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-2702, requiring mandatory extradition, instead of &sect; 22-2706. Because the extradition documents did not accurately set forth that petitioner's Kansas acts resulted in Alabama crimes, the governor was not able to exercise discretion about granting extradition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department determined that it had overpaid certain Medicaid claims for reimbursement submitted by the hospital and ordered recoupment. The district court affirmed in part and reversed in part the Department's action. On appeal, the court considered whether a bulletin was sufficient notice to the hospital that a major policy change had occurred, requiring the hospital to have in its files--prior to dispensing services in non-emergency situations to Medicaid patients--a written form from the patient's primary care physician. The court additionally considered whether of the use of a sample to project an error rate on all claims for reimbursement made in the period was proper. The court held that the bulletin was inadequate notice and the Department's recoupment based thereon constituted arbitrary and capricious action. The court held that no issue relative to the propriety of extrapolation from a sample, in general, or the particular extrapolation techniques utilized by the Department, were before the district court. Therefore the determination that the Department's actions were not supported by the evidence and violated the hospital's fundamental due process rights was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The student moved to Kansas just before attending the university and listed his maternal grandfather's home as his permanent address. He presented evidence that this was his permanent domicile. Kan.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On April 1, 1987, defendant was arrested and issued an unverified traffic citation. On April 2, defendant pled not guilty. A hearing was set but was continued at the court's request until August 12. On that date, based on an intervening court of appeals decision holding that an unverified complaint defeated jurisdiction, the State voluntarily dismissed. It refiled a verified complaint 10 months later charging the same offenses. Defendant was arrested on August 18, 1989 and arraigned on August 21, 1989. Before trial, the trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds. The court reversed, finding that the State's dismissal was necessary at the time given the status of the court of appeals opinion. Further, the State did not attempt to manipulate the speedy trial requirements. Thus the computation of time under the speedy trial statute did not commence until defendant's second arraignment. Between that date and the dismissal, 53 days passed, of which 36 were chargeable to defendant. Clearly, the speedy trial period had not expired when the district court dismissed. Considering all factors, the court also found no constitutional speedy trial violation.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the State filed a motion to revoke, citing a number of community corrections violations. The motion was granted and defendant was ordered to serve the original sentence. Defendant then filed a motion to modify his sentence based on a State Reception and Diagnostic Center report pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4603(3)(a). The trial court denied the motion, finding that the statute was not applicable to the revocations of assignments to community corrections; that the statute was unconstitutional; and because the diagnostic report did not recommend probation. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court first noted that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4603(3) was not applicable to defendant's case because it became effective after he was sentenced and did not operate retrospectively. The court found that defendant was entitled to credit for jail time he spent in the residential community corrections program.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the title companies' suit for declaratory and injunctive relief, the trial court held that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-2404b(14)(f), (g) (Supp. 1989) were unconstitutional, and enjoined the Commissioner from enforcing them. Upon review the court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the subsections in question indicated a legislative intent to limit business that had been referred to a title insurer or title agent by a producer of title business who also had a financial interest in the title insurer or agency receiving the referral. The court held that thus, the trial court erred in holding Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-2404b(14)(f) (Supp. 1989) unconstitutionally vague. The court held that &sect; 40-2404b(14)(f) gave sufficient standards to govern the rulemaking power of the Commissioner; thus, the legislature did not violate the separation of powers doctrine. The court held that there was a rational basis for the classification contained in &sect; 40-2404b(14)(f), thus the exception for less populated counties did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city had enacted an ordinance that provided for the assessment of penalties upon the triggering of a false alarm. The system users had businesses located in the city that were protected by burglar alarm systems. The city assessed administrative penalties against them based upon several false alarms. After exhausting their administrative remedies, the system users challenged the penalties in the trial court. The trial court ruled that there was no evidence to support the assessment of penalties, and it struck down the ordinance as unconstitutionally vague. In reversing in part, the court held that the ordinance was not vague because, by its terms, a system user was liable for a false alarm only if the central station that monitored the alarm could show fault on the part of the system user as opposed to a mechanical failure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association filed a complaint against the Board alleging that the unilateral contract altered certain terms that were not noticed for negotiation and that the Board's failure to negotiate terms that were not noticed was a prohibited practice. The association also alleged that the Board's refusal to make the compensation retroactive constituted bad faith. The court held that the Professional Negotiations Act did not limit the time in which to file a prohibited practice complaint to the period of negotiations. Since negotiations were completed when the unilateral contracts were issued, the Board did not coerce or interfere with the negotiations. The court found that the Board had committed a prohibited practice under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-5430(b)(1) by reducing the professional employees' salaries by the amount of the Board's mediation and factfinding costs. Even though negotiations had ceased prior to issuance of the Board's unilateral contract offer, charging teachers with the Board's attorney fees and other expenses created a chilling effect upon future negotiations. The Secretary had the authority to award the association money as a remedy for the prohibited practice.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the provision of &sect; 21-3605(1)(f) provided that parentage need only be proven by a preponderance of the evidence was unconstitutional; however, the court found that striking the sentence regarding evidence required to prove parentage from &sect; 21-3605(1)(f) did not invalidate the remainder of the statute.

The dealer claimed a security interest in a truck sold to a taxpayer and contended that the county's seizure of the truck without notice deprived him of his perfected security interest. The court affirmed the district court's judgment for the dealer and concluded that the dealer, a secured creditor, had standing and sufficient interest in the justiciable controversy to obtain a resolution as to the constitutionality of &sect; 79-2111.

The court modified the judgment and ruled that the district court erred in declaring &sect; 79-2111&nbsp;unconstitutional since the county only applied the statute in an unconstitutional manner and the statute properly gave the tax lien upon the taxpayer's personal property a preference over any other lien existing against the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city voted to allow appellee utility company to serve newly annexed territory under the utility company's existing franchise instead of granting a franchise to the rural electric cooperative. About six months later, the utility company and the electric cooperative executed an agreement for compensation to be paid to the electric cooperative pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-1,176 (Supp. 1989) of RESA. The electric cooperative later challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 66-1,176 before appellee Kansas Corporation Commission and the district court. The court did not reach the merits of the electric cooperative's appeal, because it held that the electric cooperative lacked standing to challenge the statute's constitutionality. Because the electric cooperative had benefitted from the statute by obtaining compensation from the other utility company, the electric cooperative was estopped from challenging the statute's constitutionality.
