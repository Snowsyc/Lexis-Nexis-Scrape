Further, the Commission claimed that the superintendent was not authorized to hold over beyond the fixed term. Pursuant to Article X, &sect; 8 of the Utah Constitution, the Board was given the power to control and supervise the public school system. In addition, the court found that the Board was permitted to appoint a superintendent to be the executive officer of the Board. The court held that even in the absence of a constitutional or statutory provision authorizing an incumbent to hold over beyond his fixed term until his successor had been chosen, an incumbent officer was permitted to do so. The court found that Chap. 16, Laws of Utah 1951, First Special Session, which provided for the election of the Board according to the statutory schedule, was not an unreasonable restraint upon the right of suffrage but was a valid exercise of power of the legislature. In addition, the court determined that the superintendent had been appointed lawfully and was permitted to hold over his office until a successor had been qualified.</SPAN></P>

The district court concluded that the employee had no vested rights under the Repeal Act, 1951 Utah Laws 21, which added coverage under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 418.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Repeal Act repealed and liquidated the State Retirement System and transferred public employees to coverage under the Social Security Act, pursuant to the Social Security Act Amendments of 1950, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 301 et seq. The Repeal Act reduced the years of service required for retirement, classified employees based on years of service, and expanded pensions for employees who were close to retirement. The trial court concluded that the employee was entitled to withdraw his contributions, but the trial court found that he had no vested rights to a pension. On appeal, plaintiffs contended that the Repeal Act was discriminatory and that the classifications were unconstitutional. The county alleged that the Repeal Act arbitrarily imposed onerous and undeterminable obligations on the county. The court affirmed, holding that the Repeal Act was constitutional. The court held that: (1) the classifications were within the powers of the legislature; (2) administrative convenience and expense provided a reasonable basis for the differentiation between classes; (3) the Repeal Act applied uniformly to all persons; and that (4) the county's concerns were issues for the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff retired teacher brought an action against defendants, the local teachers' retirement commission and its members and the school board members, for a declaratory judgment that Chapter 91, Laws of Utah 1949, was unconstitutional on the ground that it impaired the vested rights of retired association members. The Second Judicial District Court, Weber County (Utah) held that the statute was unconstitutional. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The local public school teachers' retirement association was organized in 1933 pursuant to &sect; 75-29-1 et seq., Utah Code Annotated 1943. The retired teacher became a member of the association by virtue of her employment as a teacher in the local public schools and retired in 1938 in good standing after 31 years of teaching. For the 1946 and 1947 fiscal years, the retired teachers' $ 600 annual pension was reduced due to the insufficient funds to pay the full pension. Pursuant to Chapter 91, Laws of Utah 1949, the association members voted to dissolve. The court held that the Utah legislature could not provide for the termination of a retirement system unless a substantial substitute was provided. The court found that, because no substantial substitute was provided for retired teachers, Chapter 91 was unconstitutional as it pertained to retired teachers in local systems. The court held that the local associations had a contractual obligation to abide by the contract that ensued from active membership of teachers prior to retirement. Participation in a distribution of the fund was not sufficient to compensate retired teachers for their lost pensions.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed his conviction and remanded for a new trial. The trial court had committed prejudicial error when it took judicial notice that the value of the stolen car exceeded fifty dollars. Although logic and common sense demanded that the jury find the car's value to exceed fifty dollars, it was improper for the judge to so instruct the jury. As a factual matter, the value of the car was within the jury's province to determine. Defendant, however, was not entitled to go free, but only entitled to a new trial, because his conviction was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer refused to honor the assignment of union membership fees from the employees wages and a criminal complaint was filed against it charging the violation of Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 49-14-1, 3 (1943). The district court granted the employer's motion to quash the information and dismissed the action. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the district court dismissing the action against the employer. The court held that Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 49-14-1, 3 (1943), repugnant to &sect; 302 of the Labor Management Relations Act (L.M.R.A), 1947, had to yield to the L.M.R.A. and was held not applicable to employers and employees in any &quot;industry affecting commerce&quot; as defined in the L.M.R.A. The court found that it was immaterial whether the assignment had not conflicted with &sect; 302 of the L.M.R.A, because the employer was not in fact required to make a check-off of fines and assessments. The court reasoned that there had been no fines imposed nor assessments assessed although the assignment required that the employer check those off if they had been owing to the union.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers claimed that the state legislature appropriated a sum to the superintendent from the Uniform School Fund for research, and the Governor vetoed such item. The taxpayers alleged that the superintendent still requested the delivery of such funds, calling the Governor's veto invalid. The superintendent filed a motion to dismiss the taxpayers' complaint, which the trial court granted upon the grounds that there was a non-joinder of indispensable parties and that the complaint failed to state a cause for relief. The taxpayers appealed, and the court held that the trial court properly found that the taxpayers had no interest in the controversy because while the expenditure of tax funds had an indirect and remote impact upon the taxpayers who contributed to the funds, they could not complain if the tax load was increased by spending for essential state functions, and thus, the controversy over the right to the use of the money had not reached the stage where the taxpayers could have either alleged or proven impairment of any pecuniary interest.

The Attorney General of the State of Utah was made a third party defendant because plaintiff's action attacked the constitutionality of Chapter 24, Laws of Utah 1949 (act).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff asserted that the act violated the provisions of Utah Const. art. VI, &sect; 29 and Utah Const. art. XI, &sect; 5. Plaintiff argued that because counties had assumed in unincorporated cities many of the functions of the incorporated cities, the functions of the counties were municipal functions the same as that of incorporated cities, and therefore, the provisions of Utah Const. art. VI, &sect; 29 forbidding the legislature to delegate the power to perform municipal functions applied to the functions that the counties had assumed. The court disagreed and found that the act was constitutional. The court held that because an improvement district created under the act was not a corporation but was a separate arm of the government formed for public purposes, it did not violate Utah Const. art. XI, &sect; 5, which forbade the creation of corporations for municipal purposes by special laws. Accordingly, the alternative writ prohibiting defendants from proceeding to sell bonds under the act was withdrawn, and the writ was denied.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the 1943 amendment to &sect; 104 -- 2 -- 5 did not have the effect of reducing the time within which plaintiff could bring such an action from a period of seven years to four years because the legislature did not amend other relevant sections on the subject. The court found that the only effect intended by the amendment was to remove any possible conflict between the newly enacted &sect; 104 -- 2 -- 5.10 and &sect; 104 -- 2 -- 5. The amendment was ineffective because the newly enacted statute had been held unconstitutional. As defendant failed to prove actual occupation of the premises for seven years, plaintiff was entitled under &sect; 104 -- 2 -- 7 to the presumption that it had been in possession within that time and that defendant's possession was in subordination to the legal title.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a state college and its board of trustees moved to dismiss plaintiff's petition for a writ of prohibition to restrain defendants from issuing bonds under authority of chapter 126, Laws of Utah, 1947. Plaintiff claimed that issuance of the proposed bonds would violate the State Constitution because it was authorized by a board of directors larger than was authorized by the Constitution, and it would create a debt of the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimed that the college's proposed sale of bonds to finance construction of a building violated the State Constitution because Utah Const. art. X, &sect; 4, which confirmed all franchises previously confirmed on the college, limited the college's board of trustees to seven, the number authorized when the Constitution became effective, whereas the board that authorized the sale of bonds consisted of more than seven trustees. Plaintiff also claimed that the proposed bonds would violate Utah Const. art. XIII, &sect; 2, as amended Nov. 5, 1946, and art. XIV, &sect; 1, as amended Nov. 8, 1910, because they would be obligations of the State. The court held that Utah Const. art. X, &sect; 4, which confirmed all franchises previously confirmed on the college, did not limit the size of the board to the number of trustees allowed at the time the Constitution was adopted. It also held that the bonds would not be State obligations because they were payable solely from revenue derived from operation of the building that they financed, the State was not obligated for them to any extent, and no purchaser could legally contend that the State had any obligation to pay the indebtedness they represented.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimed to own land, and he sued defendants to quiet title in himself. The trial court found for defendants, and the court affirmed. The court held that plaintiff was not entitled to judgment on the pleadings because his third amended complaint showed on its face that defendants were then in possession of at least some portion of the premises under a claim of right and were collecting the rents, issues, and profits. In the face of such allegation, the trial court could not, on the pleadings, hold that defendants were not seized or possessed of the property within seven years before the commencement of the action. The refusal to allow plaintiff to amend his complaint was not error because plaintiff still would not have prevailed. The court ruled that the evidence supported the judgment because it showed that plaintiff paid a nominal consideration for a quitclaim deed from a person who admitted that he had no title to the property. Thus, plaintiff was not a bona fide purchaser for value who was entitled to the protection of the recording statutes.</SPAN></P>

The statute did not give adequate guidance to those who would be law-abiding, did not advise defendants of the nature of the offense with which they were charged, or guide the court in trying those who were accused.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtors denied the purchasers' claim, and the city alleged that it had a lien on the property.

The purchasers introduced a certificate of tax sale to the county and an auditor's tax deed. The only evidence on defendants' behalf was a that neither of the auditor's affidavits were attached to the assessment roll for a certain year. Defendants claimed that the purchasers' title was invalid. The court held that under previous decisions, the purchasers' title was defective unless the statute barred defendants from interposing their defenses. In reversing the judgment, the court found that &sect; 80 -- 10 -- 68 (6), U. C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, a Colorado resident, was injured in Colorado while working for his employer, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Utah. The employee filed a negligence suit in Utah under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA). The trial court granted the employer's motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground of forum non conveniens. The court held that, although the trial court had jurisdiction, a dismissal due to forum non conveniens did not offend the Constitution. FELA did not enlarge, regulate, or control the state courts' jurisdiction or affect their modes of procedure. The state determined its courts' jurisdictional limitations and the character of the controversy they could hear. As the forum non conveniens doctrine was applied against all persons within the state, there was no good reason why the doctrine could not be extended to causes of action arising outside the state if it was applied equally as to all litigants. The court ruled that it was not convinced by the record that this case should be dismissed because the trial court and counsel gave little heed to the factual background necessary to sustain a plea of inconvenience.</SPAN></P>

A temporary writ of prohibition was issued, and the retired member sought to have it made permanent. The court found that the writ could not be made permanent and the existing writ should be quashed. Only the Board of Education could represent the rights of those who were no longer members, pensioners, annuitants and other claimants and the failure to join the Board warranted dismissal of the claim.</SPAN></P>

With regard to truckers who hauled ore for the corporation, the court found that there was sufficient regulation of their work by the corporation and that the truckers did not engage in similar work for others, which supported a finding they were employees, not independent contractors. There was not evidence, however, to support a claim the lessees were employees. The amounts charged against the corporation were not unconstitutional because the federal Social Security Act, 42 U. S.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An attorney contested a city ordinance that imposed a business tax on attorneys practicing law within the city limits. The attorney claimed that the practice of law was not within the scope of the city's taxing powers. The city claimed that the ordinance was enacted solely to raise revenue under its power to tax or license granted by Utah Code &sect; 15-8-80. The court dismissed the attorney's action and recalled a temporary writ of prohibition. The court noted that Utah Code &sect; 15-8-39 granted the city authority to license, tax and regulate certain types of businesses but that the practice of law was not specified or within the scope of powers granted in &sect; 15-8-39. However, the court held that Utah Code &sect; 15-8-80 granted the city to raise revenue by collecting a tax or license fee on any business and that &sect; 15-8-80 was not dependent on the power to regulate businesses under Utah Code &sect; 15-8-39. The court noted that a license to practice law issued by the state did not grant immunity from taxation, because although attorneys were regulated by the judicial branch, as citizens of the city they enjoyed privileges and immunities and were subject to the city's laws and regulations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contended that because the retail sale of light beer was legal, the ordinance, in singling out that one commodity and prohibiting its sale on Sunday, was not designed to effect the purposes for which the police power was granted to municipalities. The court affirmed. It noted that plaintiff's argument overlooked a specific grant of power contained in &sect; 46-0-131, U. C. A. 1943. The court found that a city could not only prohibit, but elect to permit, under such conditions or restrictions as the discretion of its governing authority dictated, subject to conformity with state law. The court found no reason why such governing authority, pursuant to the delegated power, might not prohibit the sale of beer except on certain days of the week. Plaintiff argued that the ordinance was discriminatory and denied equal protection of the law because State liquor stores and package agencies could sell light beer on Sunday. The court opined that such stores and agencies were not permitted to do so and, in fact, could not sell light beer on any other day of the week. The court concluded that nowhere in Title 46 was there any authority granted to the Liquor Commission to sell light beer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the owner and operator of a planing mill, appealed a judgment of the Third Judicial District Court, Salt Lake County (Utah) granting relief to plaintiff landowners enjoining defendant from operating his mill during certain hours on week days and all day on Sunday. Defendant also complained of the district court's finding that he was guilty of contempt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Though the mill had been in operation for many years, defendant had expanded it and also moved equipment outside. By reason of resulting increases in noise and vibration, plaintiffs sought to have the operation of the mill restricted on the ground that it was a nuisance. After the district court granted relief to plaintiffs and also found him in contempt in connection with certain conduct, defendant appealed, but the court affirmed. First, it found that the district court did not err in its findings of fact, concluding that the evidence in fact preponderated in favor of the district court's findings. Second, the court rejected a claim that the complaint failed to state a cause of action, noting as well that the claim that defendant's business was a lawful one did not prevent its operations from constituting a nuisance. Third, after reviewing various ordinances relied upon by plaintiffs in an amended complaint, the court held that defendant's operations exceeded that which was authorized by law, that he was not entitled to rely on a nonconforming use law to protect his use in excess of the authorized statutory maximum, and that the orders issued by the district court were proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank filed an application to establish a branch bank. The application and filing fee were returned because the commissioner could not consider the application until the bank had filed the written consent of the existing banks in the city as required by Utah Code Ann. &sect; 7-3-6 (1943). The bank sought to compel the commissioner to act on the application. The bank asserted that the proviso providing for consent amounted to an unconstitutional delegation of legislative powers to the existing banks. Under the facts of the case and the holding in case law the court concluded that the provision for consent of existing banks was unconstitutional. However, the bank was still not entitled to the writ. Under the statute there were two ways in which a branch bank could be established. They were to either take over an existing bank or to have the consent of existing banks. The second method was unconstitutional and there was nothing about the two methods that suggested integration. The methods were mutually exclusive and the statute was severable. The bank had not complied with the remaining requirement for the establishment of the branch bank.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff attorneys challenged the decision of the Industrial Commission (Utah), which denied their petition for rehearing, alleging that the fee for legal services fixed by the commission in a workmen's compensation act case was inadequate for the services performed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorneys argued that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 42-1-81, which authorized the commission to regulate and fix fees, violated Utah Const. art. V, &sect; 1, and was void as an unwarranted legislative and executive interference with the judicial branch of the government. The attorneys further argued that the action of the commission was without of due process of law and was a denial of the equal protection law in U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The court held that while an attorney and client in compensation cases had freedom of contract to agree on a fee in an action before the Industrial Commission, such contract was not binding on the commission. The court also held that an attorney could not charge a higher fee than that fixed by the Industrial Commission, if the commission's fee was reasonable even though the parties had agreed on a larger sum. The court held, however, that because the attorneys asked for a hearing on the question of fees before the fee was fixed, and for a rehearing after the fee was fixed, the attorneys' request should be granted. Accordingly the court set aside the award and ordered a rehearing on the matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The salesman sought to have the ordinance declared invalid and unconstitutional on the grounds that it imposed a burden on interstate commerce, infringed on free speech, and violated equal protection, both based on an unreasonable classification and the manner of enforcement.

The court further held that the classification set by the ordinance was reasonable in that there was a rational basis for controlling the sale of magazines on the streets and sidewalks, that the fact that the ordinance did not prohibit dissemination of religious materials did not render it unconstitutional, and that the denial of the injunction was proper despite the fact that the second paragraph of the ordinance was unconstitutional because the salesman had not attempted to obtain a license.</SPAN></P>

That company should have been assessed on exactly the same basis as all other water users on the river. The State Engineer unconstitutionally constructed 100-5-1, U.C.A. 1943 (Utah) because that construction amounted to taking private property without due process. The mere fact that a person or company was brought into a general adjudication suit as a party defendant on the theory that his or its water rights formed a part of the general river system did not make that person or company obligated to pay the cost of maintaining a water commissioner appointed by a court or State Engineer based upon the amount of water consumed irrespective of whether any service was received.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that &sect;19 of the Act was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed and held that: (1) the Act had a reasonable basis for differentiation between real property owners and non-owners, and the requirement that the welfare recipients sign a lien on their property was not unconstitutional; and (2) the requirement in the Act that if the wife was living with the husband she must sign the lien, but if the wife was not living with the husband she was not required to sign the lien, was a reasonable classification because the wife not living with the husband would not receive the benefits of the public assistance.</SPAN></P>

The union denied the allegations, and asserted that there was no intimidation of members or non-members of the union, and any words spoken by the union representatives were in the exercise of constitutionally protected free speech. The board issued a cease and desist from picketing order to the union. On review, the court set aside the order of the board, and held that the union's picketing was a means of expression, and as such, constituted an exercise of constitutionally guaranteed free speech which was not subject to regulation. The court reasoned that members holding &quot;strike&quot; signs and standing near a parked car on the incomplete roadway near the construction camp did not block traffic or obstruct the entrance to the place of employment, and therefore, were peaceful acts of picketing which constituted free speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under and pursuant to &sect; 5720 of the Revised Ordinances of Salt Lake City, Utah, the owners were granted permission to use a parking for the erection of their signs, many of which referred to motor courts. However, the city reserved the right to revoke, alter, or modify the licenses in the best interests of the city. In affirming, the court held that &sect; 5720 was properly amended to prohibit signs of motor lodge operators upon city property. There was a valid order requiring the owners to remove their signs immediately. The signs in question, located within the public streets, represented a classification that the legislature had adopted as subject to the city's power of prohibition and removal. The order in question was not arbitrary or capricious because it directed the removal of all signs from city parking. There was nothing illogical or unreasonable in the city's action. The original license that allowing the owners to erect their signs in city parking was at best a privilege and not a right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor sued to enforce his mechanic's lien for repairs made to the property occupied by the equitable owner. The court determined that the equitable owner's homestead exemption existed independently of whether he made a formal declaration of his exemption. By purchasing, occupying, and using the premises as a home for himself and his family, the equitable owner sufficiently manifested that the property was his homestead. Pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 38-0-2 (1943), the property was not subject to the mechanic's lien following a conveyance by the equitable owner. Under the broad definition of &quot;conveyance&quot; in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-1-1 (1943), the equitable owner's interest could be conveyed without the use of a deed. The court determined that a written instrument signed by the purchaser and the equitable owner agreeing to the conveyance, the purchaser's payment of the agreed purchase price to the equitable owner and the legal owner according to their respective interests, and the legal owner's execution of a warranty deed to the purchaser were sufficient to convey the legal and equitable interests and that &sect; 78-1-1 protected the homestead exemption in the hands of the purchaser.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff argued that no sale or use tax should be collected on the bottled gases because while the sale was consummated in Utah and subject to Utah sales tax, the tax was time-barred under &sect;&sect; 104-2-24 10, 104-2-30, and 80-15-8, U.C.A. 1943 (Utah), and that if the transaction was an Indiana sale, it was exempt from Utah use tax by 80-16-4(d) U.C.A. 1943 (Utah). Plaintiff also claimed that the transaction was subject to the Indiana Gross Income Tax Act of 1933 and exempt. The court held that (1) when the bottled gases were delivered to plaintiff or a carrier, the transaction was a completed sale in Indiana for tax purposes, and plaintiff bore the expense and risk of loss; (2) the Indiana Gross Income Tax Act of 1933, as applied to those whose income derived largely from sales in other states and foreign countries, had been declared unconstitutional, so the transaction was not exempt as to plaintiff under &sect; 80-16-4(d) U.C.A. 1943 (Utah); and (3) because plaintiff did not indicate that the use tax part of the form was intended to be treated as part of the completed form, plaintiff's return was not sufficient to start the statute of limitations running against the use tax.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court denied the out-of-state resident for a writ of prohibition because the trial court correctly ruled that it had jurisdiction. The appellate court held that the out-of-state resident was required to designate an agent by the statute, and his failure to comply with the law could not be used to defeat the resident's right to claim the benefit of the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 4862 was a Sunday closing ordinance, and it was adopted to promote the peace, health, and safety of the city's residents.

The court reversed and held that the prohibitions of &sect; 4862 had no reasonable relationship to the objectives to be accomplished by enactments made pursuant to the powers granted to the city. Section &sect; 4862 was not a general Sunday closing law designed to accomplish the purposes it purported to effect. It had reference only to mercantile pursuits, indirectly limiting those pursuits by preventing the sale on that day of all commodities with specified exceptions. It was difficult to conceive how &sect; 4862 promoted the health, safety, morals, peace, and convenience of the city's inhabitants by prohibiting the working of salespersons on Sunday, while permitting the employment of common laborers, artisans, stenographers, and laundresses. While &sect; 4862 did not expressly prohibit the carrying on of businesses of a particular type, its necessary effect was to do so.</SPAN></P>

The county clerk refused the candidate's declaration of candidacy on the ground that the amendment and &sect; 19-13-6, U.C.A. 1943 (Utah) applied to officers elected in 1946 and the office of county attorney was not an elective office to be filed at the general election in November, 1948. The court held that the amendment did not express or imply an intent on the part of the voters to prohibit its application to those officers elected in 1946 even though it took effect in 1947. Because it was not a mere guise to grant an additional term to present officeholders, an amendment of &sect; 19-13-6, namely, the act of 1947, ch. 27 (Utah), which lengthened the term of office for county attorneys, was constitutional. The amendment's removal of the two-year limitation, before the commencement of the term and without the amendment prescribing the beginning date of the new term, permitted the legislature some latitude in prescribing, within the four-year period, the starting date of the term.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff teachers sought a judgment declaring that &sect; 75-29-21, U.C.A. 1943 (Utah) of the Teachers Retirement Act (Act), as amended by Chapter 95, Laws of Utah, 1945, was valid and constitutional in order to receive credit for prior services performed as parochial teachers. The District Court, Third District, Salt Lake County (Utah) sustained the constitutionality and validity of the Act. Defendants, a state retirement board and others, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before July 1, 1937, the teachers taught in parochial schools. Before July 31, 1938, the teachers became contributing members of the state teachers' retirement system. In 1945, the Act was amended to give credit for teaching in parochial schools before 1937. The trial court declared the 1945 amendment of the Act to be valid and constitutional. On appeal, the court held that the amended Act did not violate Article VI, &sect; 30, Constitution of Utah, which forbade legislation increasing compensation after a contract had been fully performed, because the teachers' contracts still were being performed at the time the amendment was made. Next, consistent with Article I, &sect; 4, Constitution of Utah (Religious Liberty) and Article X, &sect; 13, Constitution of Utah (Public aid to church schools forbidden), the amended Act did not amalgamate church and state by granting the teachers prior credit for the time they taught in parochial schools because the teachers severed all connections with any church school more than seven years before the amendment. Nor did the amendment act retroactively so as to pay the teachers for being instructors in church schools. Rather, it paid for services in futuro.</SPAN></P>

Among other things, the Act required barber shops to close at 6 o'clock p.m. on weekdays, and to charge a minimum price for service. The lower court entered judgment for plaintiffs, finding that &sect;&sect; 2, 3, and 4 of the Act were invalid and unconstitutional as improper delegations of legislative authority, in violation of Utah Const. arts. I, V, VI, and XII, as well as U.S. Const. amends. V, and XIV. Defendants state barber board (board) and state trade commission, the enforcement agent, appealed. The court affirmed, noting that although the law was enacted as a health and safety measure in the interest of the public, the board's hands were effectively bound to agreements initiated by 70 percent of the barbers of the territorial unit involved, and that there was no way to ensure that the 70 percent majority would act in the public's best interest.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance stated that the right of the city's citizens to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures should not be violated. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly dismissed the complaint because the ordinance was void for vagueness and uncertainty. The court found that the ordinance was expressive only of an existing right and a declared policy. The ordinance did not set out with sufficient definiteness the act or acts prohibited or denounced. Further, the acts condemned as unreasonable searches and seizures were nowhere defined in reference to the results necessary to be accomplished. The ordinance was general and vague and entirely too indefinite and uncertain. The court concluded that the ordinance was only a naked declaration of a policy for the citizens to be secure from unreasonable searches and seizures, without any definition of what, in the various situations, constituted an unlawful search or seizure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment that he could bring a common law action for disability from silicosis allegedly contracted while working for his employer. The employer contended that the employee's sole means of recovery was under the Law, and because he was only partially disabled rather than totally disabled as required by the Law, he could not recover. The trial court entered judgment for the employer. On appeal, the court affirmed. The legislature occupied the complete field of silicosis, given its definition and numerous requirements for compensation under the Law, and therefore the employee's exclusive remedy was under &sect; 42-1a. The Law was not unconstitutional because it failed to provide compensation for partially disabled employees and also denied them a common law right to file suit. The legislature required the employers and employees to share the costs of the disability given the nature of the disease, the difficulty of proof, and the inability to properly apportion the negligence between different employers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As the result of a plea bargain, appellant pleaded guilty to the charge that he distributed a controlled substance, violating Utah Code Ann. &sect; 58-37-8(1)(a)(ii) (Supp. 1999). The sentence was suspended on the condition that appellant not return to the United States. Appellant was later deported, but returned to Utah after a short time. Thus, the trial court lifted the suspension and re-imposed appellant's sentence. Appellant challenged the trial court's order reinstating his previously suspended sentence, arguing that the trial court had illegally sentenced him in ordering appellant not to return to the United States. The court reversed, holding that the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2, gave exclusive jurisdiction to the federal government in matters pertaining to the exclusion of aliens. Accordingly, appellant's illegal sentence effected a withdrawal of his guilty plea, which placed the parties in their original positions prior to the plea.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued the term &quot;public offer&quot; was not well-defined under the Act and the Act was thereby unconstitutionally vague. The court found through judicial interpretation of the statutory term &quot;public offering,&quot; the term was definite enough to provide notice of proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and commercial practice. Defendant failed to show how the omission of a public offering exemption jury instruction negatively impacted his case, so that argument was rejected. Where defendant's appellate brief was inadequate, the court declined to consider the merits. Where his only evidence was the preemptory rejection of four white male jurors, defendant failed to establish a prima facie case of jury stacking. Finally, double restitution was beyond the scope of the court's statutory authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the State could not convict him of trespassory voyeurism because the incidents, for which he was charged, took place on his business property. The court rejected the argument and held that the term &quot;trespassory voyeurism&quot; in the lewdness statute,&nbsp;Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-9-702(1)(1996), did not require a showing of trespass on real property. The term &quot;trespass&quot; was broadly defined as to infringe upon the privacy, time or attention of another. Under the plain meaning of the terms, therefore, a person engaged in trespassory voyeurism by deriving sexual gratification from observing the sex organs or sex acts of someone who has a reasonable expectation of privacy. Thus, contrary to defendant's claim, the phrase trespassory voyeurism did not require proof that defendant trespassed on real property. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss and properly refused to instruct the jury that the prosecution needed to establish that defendant trespassed on real property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court accepted defendant's guilty plea to a charge of unlawful possession of a controlled substance. At sentencing, defendant sought to withdraw his guilty plea on the ground that the State breached the plea agreement. The trial court advised defendant of his right to file a motion to withdraw; however, defendant did not. Instead, defendant appealed to the court for a review of the denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The court noted that Utah R. Crim. P. 12(a) required the motion to be made in writing, which was not done. Moreover, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-13-6(2)(a) (1995) required defendant to demonstrate good cause in support of his request to withdraw a guilty plea, which was also by way of motion. The court determined that defendant's oral motion, if sufficient, was not timely under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-13-6(2)(b) (1995) because it was not filed within 30 days of the date of entry of the plea. Finally, the failure to advise defendant of the time limitation was not grounds to set aside the guilty plea, although he could have sought leave to extend the time for making a motion to withdraw under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-13-6(2)(b) (1995).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to the underlying offenses, conditional upon the opportunity to challenge the constitutionality of the gang enhancement statute.

Rather than submitting the matter to a jury, the trial court made the relevant factual determinations supporting the gang enhancement. Reversing, the court held that defendant was entitled to a new trial on the gang enhancement charge. The court stated that a Utah Supreme Court decision held that the gang enhancement statute created a new and separate offense; therefore, the Utah Code required each element of the crime to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that defendant's due process rights were violated because the elements of the crime were not established against him.

After the court denied appellant's motion for summary disposition, he filed an amended motion for summary disposition in light of new case law and again asserted that the statute of limitations regarding habeas corpus petitions violated fundamental constitutional rights. Upon review, the court found that no court had yet actually declared the statute of limitations unconstitutional. Consequently, the trial court did not commit manifest error when it dismissed appellant's petition as untimely. However, the trial court did err by dismissing the petition without having fully considered the &quot;interests of justice&quot; exception.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following defendant's conviction for aggravated robbery and burglary, the trial court sentenced defendant to prison. However, the trial court stayed this sentence and placed defendant on probation. Defendant's probation was extended after he failed to comply with its terms. After defendant admitted to escape and assaulting an officer, the trial court revoked defendant's probation and reinstated the original sentence. Defendant appealed, alleging that the initial extension of his probation was unconstitutional, but the court affirmed. Under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-18-1, probation could not be modified or extended except upon waiver of a hearing by the probationer or upon a hearing and a finding in court that the probationer violated the conditions of his probation. Prior to the extension, defendant's probation officer filed a violation report with the trial court and requested an extension to allow defendant the opportunity to comply with the conditions of his probation. In addition, defendant signed a waiver stipulating to extension of his probation. These actions were sufficient to comply with the requirements for extension. Thus, no due process rights were violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment revoking defendant's probation and reinstating original sentence was affirmed because the original extension of defendant's probation was constitutional as it complied with the statutory requirements for extension.</SPAN></P>

The court declined to address the mother's argument that attacked the constitutionality of the Termination of Parental Rights Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-3a-401 to -414 (1996 &amp; Supp. 1998) because the mother failed to timely raise the issue before the juvenile court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a 15 year old, was convicted of rape of a child in violation of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-402.1 after he had sexual intercourse with a 13 year old girl. Defendant appealed his conviction, and the court affirmed. Defendant alleged that the prosecutor failed to prove his mens rea as to the girl's age. The court disagreed because strict liability was imposed upon persons having sex with children under the age of 14. Defendant also argued that he should have been charged with the lesser offense of fornication. Because the elements of the crime of fornication and the elements of the crime of rape were not the same, it was proper to charge defendant with the greater offense. There was no overlap between the two statutes. Finally, defendant contended that &sect; 76-5-402.1 was unconstitutionally vague. A law was void for vagueness if either forbade or required the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application. Here, there was no ambiguity in the statute which clearly prohibited having sex with a child under the age of 14.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied a motion to suppress under U.S. Const. amend. IV, and held that an intoxilyzer result created a conclusive presumption of the alcohol level when driving.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer saw defendant driving inappropriately, followed him, saw him make an illegal lane change, and stopped him.

The trial court convicted defendant of violating Utah Code Ann. &sect; 41-6-44(2)(a)(i) (1998) and the related offenses. On appeal, the court found no violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV because the officer not only had reasonable suspicion, but also had probable cause to make the stop. The court ruled that &sect; 41-6-44(2) did not create any presumption that the intoxilyzer result was the alcohol level at the time of driving or any other presumption. The court held that the trial court erred by not allowing defense counsel to challenge whether the alcohol level at the test time may have been higher than the level at the time of driving. The court held that, although defendant did not make a formal offer of proof under Utah R. Evid. 103, defendant had preserved the issue. The error was not harmless because it could have changed the outcome, so the court reversed that conviction and affirmed the others.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fourth District Juvenile Court (Utah) determined that appellant parents' child was a neglected child under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-3a-103(1)(q)(i), and that this neglect justified terminating parental rights under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-3a-407(2). Consequently the juvenile court terminated the parents' parental rights under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-3a-407(3) based on neglect and parental unfitness. The parents brought an appeal of this termination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents did not challenge the findings of neglect and unfitness or the termination of parental rights, rather the parents contended that they were entitled to reunification services under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-3a-311(2)(a), and that the juvenile court violated their rights to equal protection in denying these services based on their mental disabilities. The court rejected the parents' contention that &sect; 78-3a-311(2)(a) impinged on their fundamental interest as parents. The court held that that the interest at stake were not their continued parental rights, but rather their right to receive reunification services. The court held that reunification services were a gratuity provided to parents by the legislature, and the parents had no constitutional right to receive these services. The court concluded that because the statute did not involve a suspect classification or a fundamental interest, it could be upheld as long as it bore a rational relation to a legitimate legislative purpose. The court held that the classification met the rational basis test because the statute was rationally related to the legitimate statutory purpose of protecting neglected children.</SPAN></P>

Defendant signed for the package and the police searched the home and arrested defendant, who had the package and marijuana. The trial court convicted defendant of possession of a controlled substance in a drug-free zone and defendant appealed. The court affirmed, holding that there was a probable-cause nexus to search the home based on the simple fact of a package containing contraband being shipped to that location. The court also recognized that anticipatory warrants were not per se unconstitutional in Utah. Further, the court concluded that anticipatory warrants were permitted under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-23-202 (1995). Finally, the court upheld the magistrate's determination that sufficient facts existed in the affidavit showing probable cause to support the search warrant.

She filed a motion to suppress medical records that were obtained by a workers' compensation fund investigator who forwarded the records to the Utah Attorney General's Office.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged on appeal that the district court erred by denying her motion to suppress medical records. The court of appeals held that the workers' compensation fund (WCF) did not engage in &quot;state action&quot; that implicated the Fourth Amendment when it investigated defendant's claim for its own benefit and without law enforcement involvement. The WCF agents investigating defendant's workers' compensation claims were doing so solely to determine defendant's eligibility for workers compensation benefits. Thus, they had a purpose completely independent of law enforcement. The agents then acted pursuant to State reporting statutes,&nbsp;Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 31A-31-103 to 31A-31-105 (1994), that required all insurers to report potential fraud. Thus, when the agents turned over defendant's medical records to the attorney general, the WCF was acting like any other private insurer. Further, the attorney general's office did not seek defendant's medical records, nor did it advise the WCF agents on how to proceed in pursuing their investigation of defendant. Finally, the WCF agents were not rewarded for reporting defendant's fraudulent action for criminal investigation.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the judgment, the court held that the trial court properly determined that defendant was not entitled to counsel, as his family could have afforded an attorney. The trial court was required to consider the resources of defendant's parents because he was unemancipated and lived with his parents. The court determined that defendant had no constitutional right to counsel, as he was not incarcerated. The court noted that even if it had determined that defendant was improperly denied counsel, it would not have reversed the judgment because defendant had failed to demonstrate a likelihood of a different result on retrial.</SPAN></P>

He also argued that he was denied effective assistance of counsel and that the restitution order violated Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-32a-2 (1995). In dismissing the petition, the trial court held that defendant's guilty plea to the tampering charge waived any right he might have had to attack the conviction and thus he was collaterally barred from seeking habeas corpus relief. On appeal, the court held that the statute of limitations defense was not jurisdictional and thus defendant waived that defense when he knowingly and voluntarily pleaded guilty to evidence tampering. The court held that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel where counsel obtained a reduction of defendant's possible incarceration from life to 30 years. The court held that defendant was barred from arguing that he was inappropriately assessed $ 160,000 in restitution because he did not challenge the award during sentencing, did not challenge the award on appeal, and did not allege any unusual circumstances to justify his procedural default.</SPAN></P>

The state complied with the order and also filed a petition to terminate parental rights. After trial, the juvenile court dismissed the petition, stating that insufficient supporting evidence had been presented and termination of the services was two months early under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-3a-408(3) (1995). The court reversed the dismissal, reinstated the petition, and remanded the action. The court found that the termination order was binding on the juvenile court and the parties, and therefore it was error to find the state at fault for following the order.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation argued that the city's decision to downzone the rear acreage of the corporation's land was an invalid use of the city's police power because the downzoning did not rationally advance legitimate goals involving the public's health, safety, or general welfare. On appeal, the court held that on its face, the undisputed language of the ordinance and the reasons given for the ordinance supported the city's downzoning action. The court noted that even when land value was substantially diminished as a result of zoning that fact alone was not deemed a sufficient ground for finding the regulation arbitrary and capricious. Consequently, the court concluded that the rear acreage retained some economically viable use and value. The trial court, therefore, correctly decided that the downzoning did not effect a taking. The court held that the city's decision to downzone the rear acreage was debatably a reasonable way to promote legitimate government goals, and the city did not violate the corporation's substantive due process rights.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction for communications fraud and reversed the convictions for forgery. The court held that: (1) the trial court did not commit plain error in failing to issue a cautionary instruction to the jury after the state introduced evidence that a former codefendant had pleaded guilty to charges arising from the same case; (2) a reasonable jury could have concluded that the former codefendant's testimony proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had forged or intended to forge checks for more than $ 5,000; (3) because the jury was not required to find any additional elements to convict defendant of forgery, defendant's forgery convictions were lesser-included offenses of communications fraud; (4) a reasonable investigation would have alerted counsel that his client might be facing double jeopardy, and, therefore, the lack of any investigation caused counsel's assistance to fall below an objective standard of professional competence; and (5) counsel's failure was prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the aforementioned sentencing order was harsh, unfair, and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed but modified. Under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-3-401 (Supp. 1996), the trial court considered all relevant factors in sentencing. Defendant had a history of substance abuse and threats and probably would have killed the ex-girlfriend if was not stopped. Under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-3-201(4) (Supp. 1996), the trial court has authority to order restitution. However, the trial court erred in ordering the sale of property since the statute did not give the trial court that authority. After ordering restitution, it was up to the awarded parties to file an action of execution. Since defendant was found later not to be the father of the ex-girlfriend's child, the award of child support was moot. The &quot;unnecessary rigor&quot; clause of Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 9 applied to the treatment of prisoners, not the terms of punishment. Further, the constitutional issue was not preserved in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The injured employee asserted that the statute violated the Utah Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the course of his employment, the injured employee was hurt when the alleged tortfeasor's automobile struck the injured employee's automobile. His employer's workers' compensation insurance carrier paid his medical expenses, totaling $ 2,583 and paid him for part of his lost earnings. The injured employee brought suit against the alleged tortfeasor for general damages. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the alleged tortfeasor. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, finding that Utah's no-fault statute was constitutional. Utah's no-fault statute did not abrogate all remedies for general damages. The statute only barred a cause of action for general damages if the injured employee failed to meet the threshold requirements. The statute provided a reasonable alternative remedy for persons who sustained general damages in automobile accidents. It did not affect a tort victim's ability to completely recover his or her pecuniary losses, it merely limited the ability to recover damages for pain and suffering. There was a rational basis for the statute's distinction between serious and less serious injuries and, thus, it did not violate Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 24.</SPAN></P>

After a preliminary hearing, the juvenile courts ordered the juveniles bound over and held to answer their respective charges in district court. The juveniles challenged the constitutionality of the serious youth offender statute, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-3a-602 (1996). The juvenile courts denied the juveniles' motions that the serious youth offender statute was unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated the juveniles' constitutional rights. On appeal, the court affirmed the juvenile courts' transferring jurisdiction of the juveniles. The court held that the juvenile courts retention factors of the serious youth offender statute were rationally related to the statute's legislative purpose. The serious youth offender statute did not violate the Utah Constitution or the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court found that overbreadth only occurred when it made constitutionally protected activity unlawful. There was no evidence that any protected activity was abridged by the statute. The court recognized that the prohibited behavior had to be that which was designed to cause emotional distress. The court saw no instances where behavior designed to cause such distress was protected. The court rejected defendant's argument that the statute was void for vagueness because emotional distress was not defined. The court found that emotional distress had been defined in the civil arena, which was applicable to the criminal statutes.</SPAN></P>

The instruction allowed the jury to infer that defendant stole the property or knew the property was stolen if it found that he was in possession of the property, that the property was stolen, that the possession was not too remote in time from the theft, and that no satisfactory explanation of such possession was given. The court found that the instruction did not shift the burden of proof concerning defendant's state of mind from the State to him. The instruction did not improperly expand the presumption under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-1-503 (1995). While it was error to include language that allowed the jury to infer defendant stole the car, the error was harmless.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">DCFS filed a petition that the child was dependent due to the mother's inability to provide proper parental care. The trial court granted the dependency petition and transferred legal custody of the child to DCFS. The grandmother was awarded custody and guardianship of the child when the mother voluntarily relinquished her parental rights. The child resided with the grandmother until she voluntarily placed the child in the care of DCFS because she was facing homelessness. The trial court ordered that the child's temporary custody and guardianship continue with DCFS and that the child continue to reside in a foster home. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial court clearly terminated the grandmother's custodial rights, and that her failure to timely appeal barred her from arguing that she still had custodial rights in the child. As a result, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-3a-311(2)(a) (Supp. 1995), the statute providing for the reunification plan the grandmother sought, was not applicable to her. Because the grandmother failed to raise the argument that &sect; 78-3a-311 was unconstitutionally vague at the trial court, the court would not entertain it for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court's findings that appellant visited his child on two occasions in 11 years, called one time or mailed one card to the child every four to six months and was at least two years in arrears on his child support obligation were sufficient to support its determination that appellant was an unfit parent and that he had made only token efforts to maintain a relationship with his child. The court held that the trial court had jurisdiction pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-30-4.16 to terminate his parental rights under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-3a-407. Finally, the court found that contrary to appellant's argument, &sect; 78-3a-407 was not unconstitutional because it permitted the termination of his parental rights based upon the token efforts to support and communicate with his child, and evidence of abandonment was clear.</SPAN></P>

The mother communicated with the putative father while in Utah, continuing to express her intent regarding adoption. A social services organization in Utah sent the putative father a letter describing the mother's intent and requesting that he provide additional information. He did not respond to the request. The mother gave birth and relinquished the child to adoptive parents. The father sought sole legal custody, costs, and damages. The trial court granted summary judgment for the mother. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment. It found that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-30-4.8(3) (Supp. 1994) precluded the action because he failed to file a notice of paternity with the Department of Health.

On appeal, the court noted that the &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; concept served as a safety device, to assure that manifest injustice did not result from the failure to consider an issue on appeal. The court refused to sanction the use of the &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; concept to address problems caused by ineffective assistance of counsel, which would not require defendant to prove up his claim on appeal in accordance with his burden under the Sixth Amendment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant landowner appealed the order of the Fourth District Court, Wasatch County (Utah), which awarded judgment to plaintiff neighbors in the neighbors' lawsuit for a declaration that they had an easement to use a driveway on the landowner's property. The district court held that the driveway had been dedicated to the public under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 27-12-89 (1995) because it had been in continuous public use for over 10 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner's predecessor in title gave permission for the neighbors' predecessor in title to use a driveway on the landowner's property. After title passed to him, the landowner locked the driveway gate. The neighbors brought suit. The district court found that the driveway was a public road and that the neighbors had an easement. It also set the width of the easement. The landowner appealed. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court found that, although the district court was entitled to some degree of deference, public dedication required clear and convincing evidence. The court agreed with the landowner that use by adjoining property owners and their invitees was insufficient for public dedication. There was, however, clear and convincing evidence the general public had used the driveway for over 10 years, which made the road public under &sect; 27-12-89. The district court had properly ordered the removal of the gate. The district court erred in granting an easement to the neighbors because the grant was inconsistent with the public road finding. The district court also failed to limit the dedication to the necessary and reasonable width.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's decision with respect to its finding that the driveway was dedicated to the public and its order to the landowner to remove the gate. The court reversed the award of an easement to the neighbors and remanded to the district court for a determination of the necessary and reasonable width of the public road.</SPAN></P>

The court similarly rejected defendant's contention that the statute was overbroad.

The father failed to comply with the requirements of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-30-4.8. Therefore, the trial court correctly concluded that his consent to the adoption was unnecessary and that he was explicitly barred from objecting to the adoption petition. The court held that the father needed to strictly comply with the requirements of &sect; 78-30-4.8 to preserve his right to assert an interest in the baby. He failed to do so, and the trial court properly rejected his claim of substantial compliance. The legislature provided an opportunity for putative fathers to file a notice of paternity within 10 days after it became possible for them to do so, and the father failed to exercise that right.</SPAN></P>

After review, this court found inadequate grounds for reversal of the jury's verdict.

The court noted that the ultimate question was whether, under the circumstances, the identification was reliable, and that the trial court had a measure of discretion in making this determination. The trial court had found that the victim had sufficient opportunity to observe her assailant during the attack and that her degree of attention was sufficient to identify him.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appeared at his ex-wife's house and was arrested as she had a restraining order against him. The police found a knife in defendant's pocket. Defendant was convicted for possession of a dangerous weapon by a restricted person. On appeal, defendant asserted that &sect; 76-10-503(2), as defined by Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-10-501(2), was unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts of his case and that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. The court would not consider the constitutional challenge because defendant did not raise that issue before the trial court and did not demonstrate plain error or exceptional circumstances. The court stated that it was constrained by the controlling analysis found in case law with respect to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the finding that the knife he carried was a dangerous weapon. Under case law the court had to determine that defendant's knife was commonly known as a dangerous weapon and that it was objectively the kind of instrument reasonable people would have assumed to be a dangerous weapon. Based on that ample evidence the court had to affirm the finding the knife was a dangerous weapon.</SPAN></P>

The First District Court, Cache County (Utah) awarded them only limited rights of visitation with their grandchildren. The grandparents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandparents sought increased visitation with their deceased son's children. The trial court, questioning the constitutionality of &sect; 30-5-2, awarded only the visitation agreed upon by appellee mother. On appeal, the grandparents challenged the adequacy of the trial court's findings. The court held that the trial court erred, as a matter of law, by failing to apply the best-interests-of-the-children standard mandated by &sect; 30-5-2 and that the findings of fact were not sufficiently detailed to permit meaningful appellate review. In finding the statute constitutional, the court held that: 1) the visitation rights authorized for grandparents under &sect; 30-5-2 did not substantially infringe upon the parent's fundamental rights or the autonomy of the nuclear family; 2) grandparent visitation as provided by the statute was rationally related to promoting the state's legitimate interest in fostering relationships between grandparents and their grandchildren; and 3) because grandparent visitation as provided by the statute did not unduly burden a parent's autonomous right to raise his or her children, strict scrutiny was not applied to determine the statute's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed, holding that: (1) the cause of action arose on the date of injury when Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-7(2) (repealed 1991) had not yet been repealed and, thus, the state's post-repeal denial of the victim's pre-repeal notice of claim did not result in the application of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-10(15) (1993); (2) the court was unable to resolve the victim's claims on nonconstitutional grounds, as Utah Code Ann. &sect; 41-6-14 (1988) imposed a duty of care towards members of the public using the highway during a high speed chase; (3) the repeal of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-7(2) (repealed 1991) did not violate the open courts doctrine of Utah Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff creditor appealed the decision from the Third District, Salt Lake County trial court (Utah), which dismissed the creditor's suit against defendant debtor for breach of contract due to a violation of the statute of limitations. The creditor also claimed that the trial court abused its discretion in setting aside the debtor's default certificate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The creditor was a California corporation, and the debtor was a Utah corporation. The debtor did not answer the complaint, and the trial court entered default. The debtor then filed is motion to dismiss based on the parties' choice of law provision that California law applied and its statute of limitations was four years under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 337 (1994). The appellate court reversed in part. The rule of lex fori was that the law of the forum controlled on procedural matters, and a limitations period was procedural. The lex fori rule applied regardless of a choice of forum provision. Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-12-45 (1992) created an exception for causes of action that arose in another state but were time barred in that state. The cause of action arose in California since that was were the contract was to be performed. California, however, had a tolling statute under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 351 (1994). It was unclear if the debtor could have been served in California, and thus, whether the limitations period applied was remanded. Case law holding that the tolling statute was unconstitutional in some circumstances might have invalidated any tolling period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The setting aside of the default certificate was affirmed. The granting of the motion to dismiss on limitation grounds was reversed and remanded to determine if the tolling provision of California's statute of limitations applied. If the debtor was amenable to service by that state's long arm statute, the tolling statute as applied was unconstitutional and the suit was untimely.</SPAN></P>

The sentence imposed by the trial court included a gang enhancement and a firearm enhancement. On appeal, the court clarified the sentence and affirmed the conviction. The court found that defendant neither objected at trial nor established plain error or exceptional circumstances on appeal and, therefore, was precluded from asserting that the record was incomplete, that the prosecutor committed misconduct, that the findings were inadequate, or that the gang enhancement statute was unconstitutional. The court ruled that a specific and separate finding was not required in order to impose the enhanced penalty based on the use of a firearm in the commission of the charged offense. The court found that this was especially true where the evidence was uncontroverted that defendant had in fact used a firearm in committing the crime. The court also determined that defendant's maximum sentence was 20 years, consisting of consecutive terms of six to 15 years and one to five years, which terms accurately reflected the gang and firearm enhancements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff union challenged the order from the Third Circuit, Coalville Department (Utah), which granted summary judgment to defendant board of education (the board) in the union's cause of action for damages due to the board's breach of the terms of a master contract entered by the parties, which governed labor relations between the board and its teachers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After voluntarily entering into a binding master contract with the union, the board breached its terms by unilaterally changing the contract term regarding health insurance benefits for job-sharing teachers and coercing two teachers to sign individual contracts that purported to waive the benefits of the master contract. The union filed a complaint against the board and the trial court granted the board's motion for summary judgment. The trial court ruled that the teachers had elected to bargain independently with the board and that they were not covered by the master contract. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for entry of summary judgment in favor of the union. Where the teachers had selected an exclusive bargaining agent, and where that agent had entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the board, neither they nor the board were free to bargain individually for inclusion of terms in an individual contract that contravened those in the collective bargaining agreement. The scope of the teachers' right to bargain individually did not include the right to waive benefits conferred by a collective bargaining agreement covering those teachers.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the individual was barred from bringing her personal injury action against the companies. The court reasoned that a statute of repose supplemented statutes of limitations but did not replace them. Thus, the court reasoned that even if the statute of repose applied to the instant case, the periods of repose did not supplant the four-year statute of limitations governing the individual's claims. The court found that the individual failed to name the companies within the four-year statute of limitations. The court also found that the wrongful alleged conduct of the installers was an insufficient basis upon which to impute their behavior to the companies. Lastly, the court determined that it was not grossly unfair to apply the four-year statute of limitations to the individual because neither company did anything to contribute to her delay in filing against them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after police officers found marijuana in his apartment during the execution of a &quot;knock- and-announce&quot; search warrant. Defendant had fled when he saw the officers approach, and an officer entered defendant's apartment without knocking, announcing he had a warrant, or waiting for someone to answer the door. After the trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress, he entered a conditional guilty plea to possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute. On appeal, the State conceded that the officer violated Utah's knock-and-announce statute, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-23-10 (1990), but contended that the evidence should not be suppressed. The court reversed defendant's conviction, holding that the evidence should have been suppressed. The State conceded that no exigent circumstances justified ignoring the knock-and-announce statute and forcefully entering defendant's home. Because the violation of the statute produced an unreasonable search, the unlawful execution of the warrant implicated a fundamental, constitutional concern and therefore the evidence should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the victim alleged that her injury arose as a result of the university's negligent hiring and supervision of its employee, the assault was not committed in the course of a core government activity, and the employee who struck her may not have been able to form the requisite mental intent to commit an assault. The court held that the victim's pleadings, even under a liberal reading, provided that an intentional hitting took place, and therefore Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-10(2)(1993) barred the lawsuit because the injuries arose out of an assault and battery. The court held that the victim's complaint was insufficient to allege that the employee lacked the requisite intent for assault and battery, and &sect; 63-30-10(2) still applied. The court further held that the university was generally immune from suit under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-2(4)(a) because it exercised a government function and was essential to the core of governmental activity.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a student who was arrested for criminal trespass when he entered the art school building after the director had already informed him that he was no longer enrolled there. Defendant was convicted of criminal trespass in violation of Salt Lake City, Utah, Code &sect; 11.36.130 (1990). Defendant contended that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to raise the statutory defense to criminal trespass stated in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-6-206(4) (1990). The court agreed and reversed defendant's conviction. First, the court held that it could consider defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal. Second, the court held that defendant's attorney failed to raise the statutory defense, rather than deliberately choosing not to argue it. As such, the attorney's performance was outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance and was therefore objectively deficient as a matter of law. Finally, the court held that the attorney's deficient performance prejudiced defendant because if the statutory defense had been asserted there was a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been more favorable to defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court denied his error, finding that the record did not clearly show bias on the part of the juror, and applied the Strickland presumption of valid trial strategy to counsel's trial actions. Next, defendant contended that the trial court erred by allowing the victim to remain in the courtroom during testimony of other witnesses. The court held that Utah R.

The state simply had no legal basis for retaining these fees, and while defendant was entitled to a return of those fees he was not entitled to compensation for the time he spent at the center.

An administrative law judge found that he lacked jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality of the question and declined to rule on the issue, but noted that the physician could rise the issue for purposes of preserving it for judicial review or independent action. Then, the physician sued in district court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the statutes were unconstitutional. The district court dismissed the complaint.

Also, summary judgment was affirmed on the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim, because the thrift institution did not allege a clearly established right that was violated by the Department. The court reversed the grant of summary judgment on the claim of breach of the covenant of good faith, and remanded that claim for trial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was fined, ordered to pay restitution for the victim's counseling costs, and sentenced to an indeterminate term of 1 to 15 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of forcible sexual abuse, and he appealed, claiming that Utah Rule of Evidence 615 was unconstitutional, facially and as applied in his case, and that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing the victim to testify after she had remained in the courtroom throughout the entire trial. The court held that defendant's objections were not timely or specific enough to properly raise and preserve for appeal the issue of Rule 615's facial constitutionality because the objections gave no indication of defendant's constitutional challenge and deprived the trial court of the required opportunity to consider and rule on that issue. The court found that the trial court properly followed Rule 615's instruction to allow the victim to remain in the courtroom, and thus it did not commit plain error, and such application of Rule 615 did not prejudice defendant because the victim, on recall, did not conform her testimony to the testimony of other witnesses and in no way compromised the procedural fairness of defendant's trial. The court concluded that defendant failed to meet his burden of providing substantive facts supporting his claim of prejudice.</SPAN></P>

The court held that pursuant to the destructibility-of-evidence prong of Utah Code &sect; 77-23-10(2), the no-knock search warrant was permissible because an affidavit indicated there were narcotics at the apartment that were packaged small enough to be rapidly destroyed. The court noted that a large quantity of heroin or cocaine in a residential setting was a manageable volume for flushing purposes. The court determined the warrant affidavit was not deficient on the grounds it allegedly omitted material facts regarding an informant being on probation where the affidavit established probable cause even if the omitted facts concerning the informant were added. The court found the evidence sufficiently established defendant was in possession of narcotics where he kept nodding off during the police raid, the narcotics were in his immediate presence, and he had fresh needle marks on his arm.</SPAN></P>

However, the parole board set his preliminary release date for 18 months after his incarceration date. The district court dismissed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus on grounds that the petition was barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The State asserted that petitioner's appeal was moot because he had been paroled. Reversing the district court, the court held that the three-month statute of limitation for habeas corpus actions, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-12-31.1 (1992), was unconstitutional The court also held that petitioner's release did not render his petition for habeas corpus moot because parole imposed conditions which significantly confined and restrained a parolee's freedom.

He was charged with assault on a correctional officer in violation of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-102.6. The court interpreted Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-102.6. Questions of statutory interpretation were questions of law, which the court reviewed for correctness giving no deference to the trial court's interpretations. Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-102.6 plainly and unambiguously prohibited a prisoner from throwing any substance or object at a peace or correctional officer. Where statutory language was plain and unambiguous, the court could not look beyond the language to divine legislative intent, but had to construe the statute according to its plain language. The court concluded that the commonly accepted meaning of the word &quot;throw&quot; did not encompass spitting. Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-102.6 unambiguously prohibited only the throwing of objects or material at officers. The court could not rewrite Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-102.6 to include actions that were not expressed in the statute since it was the legislature's job to declare what activity was criminal.</SPAN></P>

The issue was whether the petition was barred by the three-month statute of limitations for habeas corpus actions in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-12-31.1 (1992).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was serving a sentence of one to fifteen years on a conviction for manslaughter. At his first parole hearing he denied responsibility for the victim's death. A representative of the victim's family described the victim's beating and the inmate's violent tendencies. The Board, stating that it needed a psychological evaluation of him, issued an interim decision to rehear his case more than four years later. The Board later modified that decision, postponing the next hearing three more years. The petition for habeas corpus followed. On appeal, the court pointed out that, in a recent decision, it had determined that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-12-31.1 was an unreasonable restraint on the right to petition for habeas corpus relief. The court had declared the statute unconstitutional as a violation of Article I, Section 11 of the Utah Constitution, which protected an individual's right to seek civil remedy in state court. Thus, the district court erred in dismissing the inmate's petition as untimely. The court rejected the State's request that the court uphold the dismissal on alternative grounds. The record provided no reasonable alternative basis on which it could be upheld.</SPAN></P>

The trial courts dismissed their petitions on the basis that they were not timely filed pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-12-31.1 (1992) because they were not filed within 90 days of their convictions. Upon review, the court reversed. The court held that &sect; 78-12-31.1 was unconstitutional under Utah Const. art.

The court determined that 78-12-31.1 triggered a higher degree of judicial scrutiny where it significantly impaired the right to petition for habeas relief, which was an important constitutionally based personal right. The court determined that the state's explanation of the legislative objectives behind the limitations period were inadequate because the problems it alleged as to excessive delays, fading memories, and unjustified acquittals could take years, and not merely three months, to develop. The court concluded that the 90-day limitation was unreasonable because it was inflexible and it created an undue burden on a petitioner.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Second District Court, Davis County (Utah), entered summary judgment for defendant corporation and manufacturer and dismissed plaintiff employee's claims arising out of an industrial accident upon holding that the claims against the manufacturer were time-barred and that the corporation was immune from suit under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 35-1-60 (1988), the exclusive remedy provision of Utah's Workers' Compensation Act. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured by a mixing machine while working for the corporation's subsidiary and filed suit against the corporation and several &quot;John Does.&quot; He then filed a motion for leave to name the machine's manufacturer as a party upon learning of its name through discovery. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in ruling that the claim against the manufacturer was time-barred based on the date of trauma rather than the date of discovery of the manufacturer as the mixer's maker. The court found that (1) the reference to &quot;cause&quot; in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-15-3 tolled the running of the statute of limitation until a plaintiff discovered, or in the exercise of due diligence should have discovered, the identity of the manufacturer; (2) that absent such information, a plaintiff simply could not bring suit, and (3) that the limitation period should not be allowed to run before suit could be effectively filed. However, the court held that an issue remained as to whether the employee was duly diligent in discovering the manufacturer's identity. Finally, the court held that the trial court correctly ruled that the corporation was entitled to immunity under &sect; 35-1-60.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment in favor of the corporation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant teacher appealed his conviction by a jury in the First District, Cache County (Utah). The jury convicted the teacher of exhibiting harmful material to a minor in violation of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-10-1206 (1989). The state contended that the teacher failed to preserve the issues that he raised on appeal before the trial court and that failure constituted a waiver precluding the court from considering the issues on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Appealing his conviction, the teacher recharacterized the constitutional challenges to &sect; 76-10-1206 that he had raised at the trial, essentially raising new issues. After filing his appeal, the teacher's attorney petitioned the trial court for a certificate of probable cause pursuant to Utah R. Crim. P. 27, seeking the teacher's release during his appeal's pendency, which was denied. In his Rule 27 petition, he set forth the new issues raised on appeal. Upon review, the court affirmed the conviction on the basis of waiver. The court held that during the course of the trial, the teacher did not adequately preserve the challenges set forth in his appeal and that the teacher's later action of filing a Rule 27 petition was not sufficiently timely to avoid the state's contention of waiver. The court found that the waiver precluded the court's consideration of any of the unpreserved issues and, finding no plain error in the trial proceedings, the court refused to set aside that general rule barring consideration of the teacher's issues raised for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee was injured in an industrial accident in 1982 and died in 1988. The dependants filed claims for death benefits. The employer and its insurer denied responsibility based on a six-year limitation found in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 35-1-68(2) (1979). Because the employee died more than six years after the injury, an ALJ held that their claim was barred. The Commission affirmed the decision. The dependents sought review, arguing that &sect; 35-1-68(2) was an unconstitutional statute of repose. The court agreed, reversed the decision, and remanded the action for further proceedings. The court held that the statute violated the open courts provision, Article I, &sect; 11, of the Utah Constitution. Section 35-1-68(2) was a statute of repose because it terminated the dependants' cause of action before it arose. It was unconstitutional because no adequate alternative remedy existed. Utah Code Ann. &sect; 35-1-70 (1988), which provided for a discretionary extension of total permanent disability benefits upon an employee's death, did not provide an acceptable alternative remedy because the dependants had not received benefits under the employee's claim for a total and permanent disability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of agreeing, consenting, offering, or arranging to distribute controlled substances. He sought review, arguing that a trial court improperly refused to suppress evidence seized pursuant to a communications interception, or wiretap, order. The court upheld the denial of the suppression motion and affirmed the conviction. The Interception of Communications Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-23a-1 to -16 (1990), set forth the statutory requirements for wiretap orders. For example, the statute required that the interception be conducted so as to minimize the interception of irrelevant communications. Defendant contended that that order at issue did not comply with this requirement. The court disagreed, saying that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-23a-10(5)(c) (1990) did not require an explanation of the manner, method, or procedures for minimization. Rather, it required only that the order provide a general instruction that police officers minimize the interception of irrelevant communications. The order at issue provided that monitoring was to be terminated upon discovery that the conversation was not relevant. This order tracked the language of the statute and was valid.</SPAN></P>

The Commission affirmed the dismissal, holding that the claims were barred under the eight-year statutes of limitation found in Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 35-1-65 and 35-1-66 (1977). On appeal, the claimant asserted that the limitations on his ability to file a claim violated the open courts provision of Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 11.

Because the city ordinance, in prohibiting the raising or keeping of animals for fighting, regulated morals and promoted the general welfare of society, it did not exceed the statutory authority granted to the city under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 10-8-84. The court held that the city ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The city ordinance was not preempted by 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2156(d) because &sect; 2156(d) did not prevent states from enacting laws prohibiting animal fighting, but only prohibited the transportation of such animals unless the activity was legal in the destination state.

The court held the court had jurisdiction to carry out the remand order and that the Utah Supreme Court in its remand order required that &sect; 59-5-4-5 be applied to all of the taxpayer's property. The court rejected the county's interpretation that the fact that the county's policy was not to apply &sect; 59-5-4-5 to both real and personal property granted the county the right to fail to apply that section to all of the taxpayer's property.

The state legislature later created a noncontributory retirement system applicable to all new public employees. It allowed current employees to elect between the two systems.

The Board denied his request, and the employee sought review. The court affirmed the Board's decision. Utah Code Ann. &sect; 49-3-203(1) (1992), when viewed in context with the entire statutory retirement scheme, was unambiguous and clearly precluded the employee from remaining in the contributory retirement system. The statute provided that any person entering into full time employment with the state was automatically a member of the noncontributory retirement system. A Board resolution directed that the employee, who changed employment between covered units, was not a transferee. The court also rejected the employee's claim that the Board's application of the law violated his constitutional due process, contract, and equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court-ordered interceptions of defendant's telephone conversations, permitted under the Interception of Communications Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-23a-1 (1990), provided most of the evidence for the State's conviction. Under the Act, the attorney general, an assistant attorney general, a county attorney, or a deputy county attorney was permitted to authorize an application for a court-ordered wiretap. The court held that the county's deputy attorney was authorized to sign the wiretap application. The court found that the State had complied with the provisions of the Act and further determined that the evidence obtained under the Act properly was admitted by the trial court. In addition, the court determined that defendant's error claims regarding the alleged insufficient grounds of the wiretap failed to state specifically and distinctly the errors. Therefore, the claims were not preserved for review on appeal. The court also held that the arranging statute, under which defendant was convicted and which stated that a person was guilty if he committed any act in furtherance of arranging to distribute a controlled substance, was constitutional and was not overly broad or general.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with defendant and reversed the conviction. The court held that at the time of the arrest, any connection between defendant and illegal activity was purely speculation. The court found that defendant's mere presence in an area suspected to harbor drug activity did not give rise to reasonable suspicion that she was engaged in such activity. The court held that the trial court committed clear error in finding that the police officer articulated facts which would have supported a reasonable suspicion that defendant was engaged in criminal activity.

The out-of-state court had initially granted the wife custody of the parties' child but was subsequently withdrawn and granted to the husband even though she did not have notice of the subsequent proceeding. The court determined that the trial court had concurrent jurisdiction with the out-of-state court because it was in the best interest of the child to assume jurisdiction where the child and the wife had a significant connection with the state. It held that the trial court erred not only when it held that it lacked jurisdiction, but also erred in refusing to hold a hearing to examine whether jurisdiction should be exercised.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate sought habeas corpus relief on a claim that his restraint was unlawful because there was a discrepancy between the oral judgment, which convicted him of aggravated burglary as a third degree felony, and the written judgment, which convicted him of aggravated burglary as a first degree felony. The trial court denied relief, and the inmate appealed. The court affirmed. Because aggravated burglary was defined in Utah Code Annotated &sect; 76-6-203 (1990) as a first degree felony, the court determined that the oral judgment of aggravated burglary as a third degree felony was a legal impossibility. The court found that the inmate was charged with and convicted by the jury of aggravated burglary, a first degree felony. Considering that the trial court had the power under Utah Rule of Criminal Procedure 22(e) to correct any illegal or defective sentence and that a written judgment could correct a defective oral sentence, the court concluded that inmate's written judgment was lawful and that no relief was warranted.</SPAN></P>

The disability claimant sought a permanent partial disability award. An administrative law judge's ruling that the claim was barred was affirmed by the Commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The disability claimant was employed as a police officer for the city when his motorcycle hit a large chuck hole, jarring his back. He was treated for recurring back pain for years. The city authorized payment for all medical expenses from the injury. Long after the accident, a physician rated the disability claimant for permanent partial impairment. The court noted that every case the disability claimant cited to support his &quot;open courts&quot; argument addressed statutes of repose, not statutes of limitation. The two types of statutes were not essentially identical. The disability claimant knew of his injury the day it occurred. Even though he did not seek a disability rating or file a compensation claim until 22 years later, he knew of the injury and could have filed within the statutory period under Utah Code Annotated &sect; 35-1-99 (1974). The workers' compensation statute did not require stabilization before filing for benefits. The court concluded that the statute of limitations was constitutional and did not violate equal protection in its application.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient challenged the judgment from the Fifth District Court, Washington County (Utah), which concluded that he had shown no right to recover damages. The patient brought an action against defendant physician alleging that he performed surgery on the patient without his consent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court held that the patient failed to establish the elements of an action for failure to obtain informed consent under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-14-5(1) (1987), and the consent to surgery signed by his wife was an absolute defense under Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 78-14-5(2)(e), 5(4)(b). The patient asserted that the physician operated on him without his consent. The court reversed and remanded and found that the district court erred in holding that the patient had to meet the requirements of &sect; 78-14-5(1). The court concluded that a claim against a health care provider that was based on an allegation that there was no consent was not governed by &sect; 78-14-5(1). It was properly pleaded on a theory of battery. On remand, the patient was entitled to an opportunity to prove his common law claim of battery. Further &sect; 78-14-5(4)(b) authorized a married person to consent to health care for a spouse only in cases of emergency, or where the spouse was otherwise unable to give consent. A patient's mere temporary incapacity was no justification for obtaining consent from the spouse, if there was a reasonable opportunity to obtain the patient's own consent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's judgment that was challenged and remanded for trial or other proceedings. The patient challenged the district court's judgment that stated that he had no right to recover damages from the physician who performed non-consensual surgery.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted plaintiff a preliminary injunction and granted plaintiff summary judgment, resulting in a permanent injunction. The court affirmed the decision and held that the ordinance should be construed to maintain the character of a single-family neighborhood. Further, the words &quot;customarily incidental&quot; to a main use, as used to define an accessory use, implied that the use flowed from, naturally derived or followed as a logical consequence of, or was a normal and expected offshoot from the main use. The court concluded that use as a &quot;lodging facility&quot; of a building originally designed and constructed as a single-family dwelling was not an accessory use customarily incidental to the main use within the meaning of the county zoning ordinance. Thus, defendant's short-term rental operation violated the zoning ordinance. Because defendant failed to present any material facts creating a genuine issue for the court to review, the summary judgment was sustained.</SPAN></P>

Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-4 (1989) was valid to the extent that it granted immunity to government employees in their personal and official capacities.

The owners' rights under U.S. Const. amends, I, V, and XIV were not violated. They were given sufficient notice to avoid the order to vacate and were afforded a hearing to appeal the order.

The judgment also notified plaintiff in the action to send a copy of the judgment to the judgment creditor. Plaintiff was apparently unsuccessful in sending a copy to the judgment creditor, but contacted counsel, who directed the mailing to him. Counsel for the judgment creditor filed a notice of appeal on the same day he received the judgment. The judge dismissed the appeal as untimely without taking any evidence. The judgment creditor sought to compel the judge to reverse this order. The court granted mandamus relief. The court noted that, under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-6-10 (Supp. 1991), the time to file a notice of appeal from a small claims judgment did not run until notice of judgment entry. The court concluded that the judge should not have dismissed the appeal in the absence of evidence as to when the judgment creditor received notice of the judgment and when the notice of appeal was filed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the employee retired, he had some symptoms of silicosis.

The claimant filed for death benefits. Her claim was denied under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 35-2-13(b)(3)(a) because the employee's death occurred more than three years after the date of his last employment. On appeal, the claimant asserted that the denial was unconstitutional because it deprived her of her cause of action before the claim for death benefits arose. The court agreed and held that &sect; 35-2-13(b)(3)(a) was unconstitutional unless one of the two Berry exceptions applied. The court rejected the commission's assertion that the claimant had an alternate remedy because her rights to the death benefits were distinct from the employee's rights to disability benefits. The commission failed to demonstrate that there was a clear social or economic evil that was eliminated by &sect; 35-2-13(b)(3)(a).

Defendant appealed the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress the evidence, which was obtained as a result of a roadblock and subsequent search of the vehicle in which he was a passenger.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Utah Highway Patrol, in conjunction with the county sheriff's office, conducted a roadblock on a section of an interstate freeway. Notice of the roadblock was published in the newspaper circulated in the county one week before the roadblock was instituted, and signs were placed on the freeway, warning drivers that they would have to stop. Defendant was a passenger in a car that was stopped. He and the driver consented to the search of the vehicle. The warrantless search revealed a large quantity of illegal drugs and paraphernalia, guns, and cash. Defendant argued that the evidence should have been suppressed because the roadblock stop of the vehicle was illegal, and because there was insufficient attenuation between the illegal roadblock and any consent given. In reversing the convictions and the denial of the suppression motion, the court held that (1) the roadblock stop violated defendant's Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable seizures, and (2) defendant's consent to have the vehicle searched was not sufficiently attenuated to dissipate the taint of the illegal roadblock.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers observed defendant cross a street where there was no crosswalk and decided to cite him for jaywalking under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 41-6-79 (1988) of the Motor Vehicle Act. A computer check revealed an outstanding warrant, and he was placed under arrest. A search revealed a controlled substance, and defendant was charged with possession of a controlled substance with the intent to distribute. The trial court denied his motion to suppress, and defendant pled guilty to possession of a controlled substance, a third-degree felony, under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 58-37-8(2)(a)(i) (1990). On appeal, the court held that the seizure incident to the arrest was valid and found that: (1) the stop of defendant for jaywalking was proper because the Sierra test for pretext did not apply as the officers had no discretion as to which laws would be reasonable to enforce, and, upon observing a violation of law, they could not be expected to make a legal determination as to whether or not a &quot;reasonable officer&quot; would arrest the violator; and (2) the warrants check was proper because it was conducted within the course of the stop for jaywalking and did not exceed the scope of that stop.</SPAN></P>

Respondent Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing (licensing division) denied his application pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 58-25a-3.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The psychologist obtained his degree from a university that was not accredited. When he applied for licensure in the State of Utah, the university was accredited, and the psychologist was licensed in California. The psychologist argued that his degree satisfied the education requirements of &sect; 58-25a-3 because the university was accredited at the time he applied for licensure. He also asserted that he qualified for a review of his qualifications under the reciprocity provision of the Act. The court reversed the licensing division's denial of the license. The court held that that it was error for the licensing division to disqualify the psychologist from the application process without conducting an individualized review of his credentials. The court found that the licensing division failed to acknowledge that the reciprocity provision itself was the statutory authorization for adjusting the minimum requirements for reciprocity applicants. The reciprocity provision was clearly intended to allow licensure of applicants with less than the minimum requirements set forth in &sect; 58-25a-3 because of their licensed status in other states.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with a second-degree felony. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized during the search of his car. The trial court concluded that the officer's stop of defendant was an unconstitutional &quot;pretext&quot; stop, and ordered the evidence seized by the officer suppressed. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case. The court found that the trial court applied the wrong legal standard when holding that the traffic stop was a pretext stop because the trial court incorrectly focused on the officer's subjective motivation when it should have been focusing on the objective question of whether a reasonable officer would have made the stop under the same circumstances absent the illegal motivation. The court also found that the trial court's findings of fact were inadequate as to whether the officer had a reasonable suspicion that defendant was driving without a license because the findings did not clearly establish how the officer arrived at the suspicion that defendant was driving without a license.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners' assertion that securities laws of Utah were preempted was without merit, as Congress did not intend Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to displace state law in same area, and Congress expressly gave states authority to regulate securities. The court held that any contention that the order as it applied to petitioners violated Commerce Clause was without merit. The court held that under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 61-1-6(1) (1989), the Utah State Division of Securities had significant latitude and deference in issuing order denying, suspending, or revoking any agent, broker-dealer, or investment adviser registration if he found that order was in the public interest and that defendant engaged in dishonest or unethical practices in securities business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to convict him because neither the county attorney, nor the deputy county attorney, had properly assumed office, that his constitutional rights were violated by requiring him to submit handwriting exemplars, and that the statute under which he was convicted had been held unconstitutional. The court affirmed the conviction. Defendant's main issue was that the county attorney had not obtained an appropriate bond under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 17-16-11 (Supp. 1991), although the county had a blanket bond for its officials. The court concluded that the county attorney and the deputy county attorney had authority to prosecute defendant because, even if the requirements of for official bond or for appointment had not been fully satisfied, they had de facto authority by having assumed office and exercised their duties under color of a valid election or appointment with community acquiescence.

On appeal, defendant claimed that his right to a speedy trial was violated. Defendant relied on Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-29-1(4) (1990). The court reasoned that a 316-day period of time between arrest and trial exceeded the statutory directive and consequently acted as a &quot;triggering mechanism&quot; for heightened scrutiny of defendant's claim that his right to a speedy trial was denied. The court reasoned that because defendant's own actions were the main cause of delay and because defendant failed to show any prejudice caused by the delay, he was not denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial. His conviction was affirmed. Furthermore, when a parole officer had reasonable suspicion to believe that a parolee was violating parole, no warrant was necessary to make an arrest.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed the conviction. He contended that the admission of an intoxilyzer affidavit and custodian certificate pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 41-6-44.3(3) was invalid because it created an unconstitutional mandatory rebuttable presumption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State introduced into evidence an intoxilyzer affidavit and custodian certificate, from the officer who gave defendant a breath test, in order to attest to the accuracy of the intoxilyzer machine used to test defendant. Defendant claimed that the admission of the affidavit and certificate was impermissible because it created an unconstitutional mandatory rebuttable presumption of the accuracy of the test and the results, and it shifted the burden of proof on those issues to him. The trial court ruled that &sect; 41-6-44.3(3) was constitutional because it was a statutory exception to the hearsay rule that did not shift the burden to defendant. In affirming defendant's conviction, and the admissibility of the affidavit and certificate, the court held that because &sect; 41-6-44.3(3) only addressed the admissibility of evidence, it did not shift the burden of proof on an essential element of the crime, and was therefore constitutional. The court stated that &sect; 41-6-44.3(3) was a statutory exception to the hearsay rule and was merely a codification of the findings necessary to establish a proper foundation for the introduction of breathalyzer evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant retailer appealed from his Fifth Circuit, St. George Department (Utah) conviction on obscenity charges for violating plaintiff city's ordinance, St. George, Utah, City Ordinance No. 2-77-2, against displaying an obscene picture depicting sexual conduct. He argued the obscenity ordinance was unconstitutionally applied to him and that it was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retailer sold hard rock record albums and T-shirts. His small store was open during evening hours only. He was charged with violating the city's obscenity ordinance for displaying three painted bed sheets used as wall hangings, which were visible to anyone entering the shop. The sheets appeared to be a collage of drawings and slogans in different sizes and styles. The paint appeared to have been sprayed or brushed on, and pictures and slogans were crude and simplistic. The court reversed the conviction, applying the Miller and Kois tests. The Miller test had been incorporated into the ordinance except for the definition of &quot;sexual conduct.&quot; Insofar as the definition described materials that depicted or described patently offensive &quot;hard core sexual conduct,&quot; and insofar as that conduct passed muster under the Miller test, the ordinance was constitutional. But while the spray painted drawings were vulgar, offensive, and confrontational, they were too sketchy and abstract to appeal to prurient interests or be patently offensive, and they met the Kois test because they rationally related to the immediate context (the wall hangings) and the broader context (the record store).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retailer's obscenity conviction was reversed because as a matter of law the drawings did not appeal to the prurient interest and were not patently offensive, as they were too abstract, and because they rationally related to the rest of the collage of which they were a part, which taken as a whole was not patently offensive and did not appeal to the prurient interest.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted. Defendant filed a motion for a new trial, contending that the gun should have been suppressed. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant filed a motion to arrest judgment, pursuant to Utah R. Crim. P. 23, claiming that the gun should have been suppressed. The trial court denied the motion and defendant appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court found that under Utah R. Crim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The son was born while the mother was incarcerated and he resided with his maternal grandmother. After her parole was revoked and she returned to prison, she voluntarily gave custody of the son to the caretakers. After her release, they petitioned the lower court to terminate her parental rights. The court granted the petition, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that while the six-month period had not been met that would establish prima facie case of abandonment, the trial court's finding that abandonment had been established based on a pattern of no contact, support, nurturing, parenting, or caring was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The requirement of notice and efforts at remedial action prior to commencement of parental rights termination proceedings applied only to more &quot;exotic&quot; forms of abuse or neglect and not to consistent patterns of obvious physical abuse and neglect. The finding regarding abandonment precluded a determination that the state was required to provide assistance to the mother.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 14. The court reversed and remanded. Defendant's consent to search his car was arrived at by exploitation of an illegal roadblock. The consent was invalid. The exclusionary rule applied to violations of both constitutions. All evidence obtained under defendant's consent had to be suppressed. Troopers believed that the discovery of marijuana in the car under the consent search gave them probable cause to continue searching after consent was withdrawn. However, because the initial consent was invalid, any probable cause found while searching under that consent was also invalid. The roadblock was impermissible. It was a suspicionless, investigative, non-emergency roadblock, conducted in the absence of legislative authority. There were no intervening circumstances between the illegal stop and defendant's consent. The circumstances had to be independent of the primary illegality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Utah sought review of a decision of the Sixth District Court, Sevier County (Utah), which dismissed with prejudice its criminal action against defendant. The State had set forth the action by alleging that defendant possessed a controlled substance with an intent to distribute in violation of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 58-37-8(1)(a)(iv) (Supp. 1989).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a pretrial motion to suppress the seized contraband, which was denied. The case then proceeded to a bench trial. After all the evidence was presented, defendant renewed his motion to suppress. The trial court sustained the motion on the basis that defendant's continued detention after the purpose for a roadblock had been accomplished was unreasonable and unconstitutional. Thus, the trial court found that defendant's consent in fact to the search of his vehicle was therefore irrelevant to the suppression issue. Subsequently, the case was dismissed with prejudice. The court dismissed the appeal on the basis that the trial court's action constituted an acquittal, which was not appealable by the State. The order appealed from was clearly based on the trial court's assessment of the sufficiency of the evidence ruled admissible at trial. Although Utah R. Crim. P. 26(3)(a) authorized the State to appeal directly from a &quot;final judgment of dismissal,&quot; it did not authorize the State to appeal a ruling by the trial court that was in substance an acquittal. A defendant once acquitted could not again be subjected to trial without violating double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

A narcotics agent, working with a confidential informant, set up a drug buy with a woman who was supposed to introduce the agent to a drug dealer. The agent, the informant, the woman, and another man picked up defendant, who told the agent to go to a store to make a phone call and then the dealer would bring the cocaine to the location. The drug purchase was consummated at another location when defendant was not present. Defendant contended that because he never possessed the cocaine, did not direct the agent to the house where it was purchased, was not present when the transaction occurred, and never discussed prices or handled money, he could not be considered a participant in the arrangement. The court found that defendant's actions were sufficient to bring him within the proscription of the statute. He was one link in a chain of events. He acted knowingly and intentionally, and he was instrumental in arranging the sale. The statute was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner worker sought review of an order of the Industrial Commission (Utah), which denied workers' compensation benefits. The worker claimed that an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) erred in finding that she failed to prove that her exertion at work was a legal cause of the permanent total disability for which she claimed benefits, and that the Commission erred in denying benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After more than two months of lifting heavy tubs 30 to 36 times a day, the worker experienced back pain, had three back operations, and was unable to work. An ALJ found that 75 percent of the worker's impairment was caused by an industrial accident, and 25 percent was due to a preexisting back condition. Although he also concluded that because of the preexisting condition, she did not prove legal causation required by the Allen test, he recommended that she be awarded permanent total disability benefits. Based on her failure to satisfy the Allen test, the Commission denied her claim. After holding that the worker was not required to cross-appeal to the Commission from the ALJ's adverse finding on legal causation, the court applied an intermediate standard of reasonableness and rationality to its review of the mixed questions of law and fact that were at issue. It held that the ALJ erroneously assumed that, because the worker suffered from a preexisting condition, the Allen test necessarily applied. It did not, and the worker proved legal causation because her accident was the climax of repeated exertions that were not comparable to the wear and tear exertions of nonemployment life.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue fort the court on appeal was whether defendant's conduct constituted &quot;taking indecent liberties.&quot; Utah courts addressed this problem by interpreting the broad, catchall phrases of sex crime statutes (phrases such as &quot;taking indecent liberties&quot;) in light of all of the facts and circumstances of the case. Section 76-5-404 did not specify whether the prohibited touching of an enumerated body part was of a clothed, as well as of a naked part. Absent any express direction from the Utah legislature, the court on appeal regarded the presence of clothing on the touched body part as an important fact in determining whether defendant had taken indecent liberties. The court on appeal found that defendant's acts constituted &quot;taking indecent liberties&quot; for purposes of the statute. Defendant enticed the youthful victim into an abandoned house by and there detained her against her will for about 20 minutes to serve his sexual purposes. It was in that setting that he placed his hand on the breast of his frightened, pleading victim. The court on appeal found his misconduct sufficiently grave to constitute forcible sexual abuse in violation of &sect; 76-5-404(1).</SPAN></P>

Defendants were convicted of unlawful possession of a controlled substance and possession of a controlled substance without tax stamps affixed. On appeal, defendants denied that they had consented to the searches. The court reversed because the trial court had erred in its finding that the police had had the reasonable suspicion of criminal activity necessary to justify their continued detention and questioning of defendants once the warning citation was given and the purposes for the initial stop had been accomplished. After that point, defendants' detention violated their Fourth Amendment rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of theft and appealed. The court affirmed the conviction. The court found that the record was void of evidence to support defendant's contention that he had been appointed counsel prior to his interrogation.

Defendant's argument that the trial court erred by failing to grant his motion to dismiss on grounds the prosecution failed to disclose exculpatory evidence was rejected. The court found that when the discovery violation was brought to the attention of the court, defendant did not object, request a continuance, or call for a mistrial. Rather, defendant sought to dismiss. Under the circumstances, it was not unreasonable for the trial court to deem it unjust to grant defendant's motion when there were other, less harsh remedies specifically mentioned in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-35-16(g) (1982) available to him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction involved the controlled substance phenyl-2-propanone (P2P).

V, &sect; 1. On appeal, the court found that section of the statute was unconstitutional and reversed the convictions. The court found that a predecessor statute,&nbsp;&sect; 58-37-3(1974) had been declared unconstitutional because it improperly delegated authority to designate a controlled substance to the state's executive branch. The legislature then amended the statute to give the authority to the United States Attorney General.

The court held that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 58-37-3(3) (1986) and &sect; 58-37-2(4) (Supp. 1988) were unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that he was denied effective assistance of counsel, that his motion to suppress evidence should have been granted, and that the evidence was insufficient. He also challenged his sentence. On appeal, the court held that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel, that his motion to suppress was properly denied, and that sufficient evidence supported his conviction. The court found that no specific objection was ever raised to the joint representation of defendant and his co-defendant by two public defenders from the same office and that defendant failed to show that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his attorney's performance. Regarding the motion to suppress, the warrantless seizure of the shotgun from defendant's bedroom was justified because the shotgun was in plain view when the officers lawfully entered the apartment to arrest defendant. In addition, the stolen jewelry recovered from defendant's girlfriend's purse was admissible because she consented to the search of her purse. The court, however, reduced the enhancement sentence for use of a firearm in the commission of a first-degree felony from six years to five years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that Rule 26(13)(a) of the Utah Rules of Criminal Procedure violated Utah's constitutional guarantee of the right to appeal insofar as it precluded any appeal from the circuit court's judgment in a trial de novo except when the validity or constitutionality of a statute or ordinance was raised in the justice court. The court noted that the issue had previously been decided adversely to defendant. In the circuit court, defendant had argued that failure to grant his motion to amend the information against him by deleting the disjunctive charge that he had driven while &quot;under the influence of alcohol&quot; contrary to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 41-6-44 would unconstitutionally subject him to double jeopardy. He also unsuccessfully challenged the admission of his breath test results. The circuit court's rulings against defendant on both points were the reversible errors asserted in his appeal. Dismissing the case, the court concluded that it was apparent that neither involved the validity or constitutionality of an ordinance or statute. Accordingly, the court lacked jurisdiction over the case and was precluded from reaching the merits of the issues raised.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a plea bargain, the inmate pled guilty to five counts of theft by deception, a second-degree felony, and five counts of securities fraud, a third-degree felony. Approximately 40 other pending counts were dismissed. On appeal from the dismissal of his petition for writ of habeas corpus, the inmate claimed that the manner in which his parole hearing was conducted denied him procedural due process and subjected him to double jeopardy. The court held that its review of those claims was not precluded by Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-27-5. The right to petition for habeas corpus based on a violation of substantial constitutional rights was guaranteed by Utah Const., art. I., &sect; 5. However, the court held that the Utah parole statute,&nbsp;Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-27-5(3) (Supp. 1989) did not create an &quot;expectation of parole&quot; that subjected the proceedings of the Board of Pardons (Utah) to due process protections. Furthermore, a parole proceeding was not a criminal proceeding that subjected the inmate to jeopardy, and guarantees against double jeopardy were not applicable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On prior appeals, the landowners had already been before the state supreme court on three occasions. The state supreme court found that the ordinance, though facially constitutional, may have been unconstitutionally applied to the landowners. On the last remand, the trial court allowed the landowners to amend their complaint, but their request for class certification was again denied. The landowners appealed the trial court's refusal to try the civil rights issue, award attorney's fees and costs, and join the other subdividers as plaintiffs. The court held that because the landowners failed to produce an adequate record of the trial court's decision regarding the civil rights claim, the court could only assume the regularity of the proceedings and affirm the decision. Thus, the landowners were not entitled to attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. The court refused to address the landowners' claim for attorney's fees under Ariz. R. Civ. P. 11 and the common fund because the issues were not raised below.

It found that the Utah Drug Stamp Tax Act had no provision providing for disclosure of any identifying information to prosecuting authorities. The court could not say that one of the Utah Legislature's objectives in enacting the Utah Drug Stamp Tax Act was to facilitate criminal prosecutions based upon information obtained from compliance with the statutes. The court found that the scope of the immunity provided by the Utah Drug Stamp Tax Act was broad enough to give the same protections provided by the Fifth Amendment and, therefore, uphold its constitutionality. The court noted that defendant was charged with the failure to pay the tax and obtain the stamps. He was not, therefore, injured by the provision concerning where to place the stamps.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's no-contest plea to communications fraud was conditioned upon allowing him to contest the constitutionality of &sect; 76-10-1801. On appeal, he argued that the statute violated his right to due process by imposing on him the burden of disproving his criminal intent as an element of the offense. The court noted its skepticism about defendant's standing to pursue the issue. The court found it difficult to see how defendant was injured by the provisions in the statute when he pleaded no contest after hearing the state's evidence, without producing any evidence. Finding the statute constitutional, the court held that whether or not &sect; 76-10-1801(7) was viewed as an affirmative defense, the fundamental burden concerning defendant's culpable mental state rested with the prosecution. The statute required the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had either the knowledge of the falsity, or a reckless disregard for the truth, of any pretenses, representations, promises, or material omissions made by defendant. Section 76-10-1801(7) merely emphasized that absent either of these mental states, a conviction for communications fraud was improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of a court of the First Circuit, Cache County (Utah), which convicted him upon a jury verdict for committing the misdemeanor of disorderly conduct in violation of Logan City, Utah, Ordinance 12-8-9(2)(D) (Feb. 19, 1987). On review, defendant contended that the ordinance was unconstitutional on its face and as applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance rendered a person guilty of disorderly conduct if, intending to cause public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he engaged in abusive or obscene language or made obscene gestures in a public place. It was apparent that the ordinance criminalized speech. On review, the issue was whether the ordinance was overbroad, vague, and therefore facially invalid as violative of the First Amendment. Reversing, the court held that it agreed with defendant that the ordinance was unconstitutionally overbroad on its face. The ordinary definition of &quot;abusive&quot; gave it far greater reach than &quot;fighting words.&quot; Furthermore, as the intent required as an element of the offense made clear, the abusive language penalized by the ordinance was expressly not limited to harsh insulting words that by their very utterance tended to incite an immediate breach of the peace. The ordinance, far from being narrowly drawn, applied to all harsh insulting words that recklessly created a risk of inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, not just to those that had a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person to whom, individually, the remark was addressed.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner contended that the statute of repose unconstitutionally denied him a remedy for his occupational disease.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 35-2-13(a)(2) provided that no compensation was to be paid for a disease other than silicosis unless total disability resulted within one year from the last day upon which the employee actually worked for the employer against whom compensation was claimed. The court noted that Article I &sect; 11 of the Utah Constitution guaranteed a person a legal remedy for an injury done to his person, property, or reputation and that the provision had been held repeatedly to invalidate a statute of repose that deprived a person of a remedy for an injury before a cause of action even arose. The court concluded that the statute of repose in the case at hand did exactly that, noting that the latency period for asbestosis was 15 to 40 years; therefore, a person who contracted asbestosis in his work would be unaware of the disease until its symptoms became apparent, which generally would be years after the statute of repose had run. The court reasoned that a person could not file an occupational disease claim for a disease that he did not know he had. The court held that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 35-2-13(a)(2) (1988) violated Article I &sect; 11 of the Utah Constitution and therefore was invalid.</SPAN></P>

An administrative law judge (ALJ) had adopted a medical panel's findings and conclusions of law and denied permanent disability benefits to the applicant because the ALJ found that the applicant failed to demonstrate that his ongoing medical condition was related to his industrial accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant hurt himself while lifting a pallet at his place of employment in January 1987. He heard a pop in his back and felt a sharp pain. His injury was diagnosed as a musculotendinous strain. He received temporary total disability benefits for that injury, return to work, experienced a recurrence of back pain, and was again paid temporary total compensation. Following further therapy, he began working for a new employer and was injured when he landed on his back after the boards on which he was sitting gave way. On his claim for permanent disability benefits, the ALJ determined that the residual problems the applicant complained of were caused by his pre-existing conditions of Reiter's syndrome and spinal stenosis. The Commission denied the applicant's motion for review. Affirming, the court held that the applicant's contention that disability benefits should have been awarded under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 35-1-69 (Supp. 1987) (repealed 1988) because the industrial accident aggravated his previous asymptomatic conditions was without merit, as no permanent impairment was found to have resulted from the industrial injury itself or in combination with pre-existing conditions.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the juvenile court's order and held that the citizen failed to show any evidence that was contrary to the trial court's findings that she was unfit and substantially neglectful or incompetent by reason of her course of conduct, alcohol/drug addiction, and failure to respond to help. The state gave the citizen adequate notice of her deficiencies in that it repeatedly warned her, verbally and in writing, that she was in danger of having her parental rights terminated. Each time that the children were placed in protective custody, the specific reasons for their removal from the mother's home were identified and each time she admitted the critical allegations.

Transferring the case, the court concluded that it was also unclear whether it had jurisdiction under &sect; 78-2a-3(2)(g) because the underlying conviction arose under Arizona law and it was not certain whether the inmate's convictions should have been considered as other than first degree felonies under the scheme by which criminal jurisdiction was allocated between the court and the Utah Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court concluded that the father could not inherit from his illegitimate child because he had not openly treated the child as his own as required by Utah Code Ann. &sect; 75-2-109 (1978), and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 75-2-109 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because it promoted legitimate state interests of providing efficient estate administration and was based on situational differences between unmarried mothers and fathers. In addition, the father failed to establish entitlement to constitutional due process protections by proving only a biological link to the child.

The officer investigated and corroborated her statements, found that defendant had a prior conviction, and obtained a search warrant. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion to suppress evidence. There was no clear error and although the witness had not been in the house for two months, the mere passage of time did not invalidate the supporting bases for the warrant. The court could have had a reasonable common sense belief that there was an ongoing pattern of marijuana use in the home. The warrant description of controlled substances and drug paraphernalia was not so broad as to offend the requirement that descriptions be made with particularity. The statute was rationally related to the legitimate governmental interest of protecting minors from drug-related activity. The enhanced penalty was not unconstitutional as it was not arbitrarily drawn and rested upon a rational distinction.</SPAN></P>

If an employee violated reasonable rules of the employer and the three elements of culpability, knowledge, and control were established, benefits had to be denied.

The recall motion was denied, and this appeal followed. The court affirmed the order. References in the hearing transcript indicated that a clear and convincing evidence standard was imposed and that defendant was required to go forward with the evidence. Thus, there was no due process violation. No liberty interests were implicated in the recall proceeding because the purpose of the proceeding was to select a forum. Thus, the limits to relevance did not unconstitutionally infringe on the right to present relevant evidence. For purposes of this proceeding, it was unnecessary for the juvenile court to decide whether defendant's statements were voluntary.  Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-3a-25(8) (1987) permitted the direct filing of all charges against defendant, which arose from a single criminal episode, because at least one of the charges was among those enumerated in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-3a-25(6) (1987)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee was randomly selected for drug testing and tested positive for marijuana. The employer refused to allow him to identify the prescription medications he was then taking and discharged him. A referee awarded unemployment benefits after the employer twice failed to submit the written report of the test results. The board declined to consider the proffered report because to do so would deprive the employee of the right to challenge the results. The employer argued that just cause existed for the employee's discharge because it was entitled to the presumption under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 34-38-10(2)(a) (1988) that the test results were valid. The court held that the employer had failed to show that its testing procedures met the criteria of &sect; 34-38-6. The employer had not afforded the employee the opportunity to present evidence about the prescription drugs, as required by &sect; 34-38-6(3)(b), and had not shown that the test conformed to scientifically accepted procedures because an office manager's hearsay testimony did not establish a foundation for admitting the results.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The investigator sent a report to the fire marshal. The fire marshal did not, at first, produce the report in a civil suit. The grand jury indicted the investigator. The trial court convicted the investigator of tampering with a witness and official misconduct. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court concluded that the record contained sufficient evidence from which the jury could conclude that the investigator knowingly or intentionally attempted to induce the fire marshal to withhold the report from the official investigation. Although the investigator may have committed an unauthorized act by distributing the report to the fire marshal in violation of office policy, there was no evidence that the act purported to be an act of his office. The court found no evidence that the investigator knowingly refrained from performing a duty imposed by law or inherent in the nature of his office. Since the investigator knew he was the target of the grand jury investigation before testifying and was informed of his right to counsel, the court held that his testimony was properly used during trial. The court held the trial court did not err in excluding the juror affidavit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was an inmate at a state prison, was tried by a jury for assault by a prisoner. The jury rejected the defendant's defenses of self-defense and habitation, and defendant was subsequently convicted of assault by a prisoner in violation of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-102.5 (1978). On appeal, first defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's guilty verdict and the trial court erred in refusing to reduce the felony assault charge to a misdemeanor. The court found that the jury verdict implicitly rejecting defendant's statutory defenses was supported by the evidence and consistent with Utah authority. Further, the court held that defendant was not justified in resisting prison authorities solely on the basis of an actual or perceived constitutional violation. The court found that the evidence was not sufficiently inconclusive or inherently improbable that reasonable minds had to entertain a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the crime. Additionally, the court concluded that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-102.5 and Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-102.4 did not proscribe the same conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association filed an action for declaratory judgment against the board to challenge a food service establishment inspection fee regulation as unconstitutional. The association contended that the findings of fact and conclusions of law adopted by the board were not supported by evidence presented at the public hearing contrary to the requirements of the Act. The trial court held that the inspection &quot;fee&quot; was invalid because it constituted a tax, which the board was not statutorily authorized to levy. And, even if it was not a tax, the Act did not authorize the board to impose fees in the form of charges on food establishments to defray the costs of the food establishment inspection program. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the order of the trial court. The court held that the trial court erred in holding the board's findings of fact and conclusions of law invalid under the Act. The inspection fee regulation adopted by the board was not invalid as an unauthorized tax. The trial court's ruling to the contrary was in error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged and convicted in a justice of the peace court. He took a de novo appeal to the circuit court, where he insisted that he was not guilty because he had a valid Wyoming driver's license. Defendant was again convicted, and he appealed. In dismissing the appeal on the City's motion, the court of appeals ruled that it could not reach the merits of defendant's argument because it lacked appellate jurisdiction under &sect; 77-35-26(13)(a), which conferred jurisdiction over a criminal matter originating in a justice court only when the validity or constitutionality of an ordinance or statute was raised in that court, and defendant's defense of having a Wyoming license did not raise such a challenge. Because a justice court was a court not of record under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-5-0.5 (1987), it was presumed that if such a challenge was raised in the circuit court, then it was also raised in the justice's court, but defendant failed to show that he challenged the constitutionality or validity of the license statute.

The court first determined that the newspaper had standing to challenge the juvenile court's closure of the hearing because the newspaper received actual notice of the closure order. The court then affirmed the juvenile court's order, holding (1) the presumption of openness applied in criminal trials under U.S Const. amend. I did not extend to juvenile proceedings, (2) the Utah Constitution did not guarantee the public a right to be present at juvenile court proceedings, and (3) the juvenile court's closure of the hearing was proper because there was a possibility that sensitive information about the juvenile's psychological condition would be revealed and that information revealed at the hearing would prejudice the juvenile's right to a fair trial if he was later tried as an adult.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that defendant had a right to return of the money since &sect; 77-24-2 was not a forfeiture statute and could not be used in a manner that constituted a forfeiture.

Defendant claimed that the raising of her dress and slight exposure of her covered buttocks did not constitute &quot;exposure&quot; or rise to the level of an &quot;act of gross lewdness&quot; under &sect; 76-9-702.5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's son was detained after school and walked home in the dark, fell, and injured his ankle. In the course of confronting and reprimanding teachers and school administrators about the incident, defendant went to her son's algebra class.

The court interpreted the term &quot;exposes&quot; as it appeared in &sect; 76-9-702.5 according to its plain meaning and held that the phrase &quot;exposes his or her genitals or private parts&quot; was limited to instances involving at least partial nudity. Under the doctrine of ejusdem generis, the court held that the phrase &quot;act of gross lewdness&quot; as it appeared in &sect; 76-9-702.5 referred to an act of equal magnitude of gravity as the other acts specifically set forth in the statute, namely the exposure of genitals or private parts, masturbation, or trespassory voyeurism, and that defendant's act did not rise to the magnitude of conduct expressly proscribed by &sect; 76-9-702.5.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a search of defendant's house pursuant to a warrant, officers found controlled substances and a television. Defendant was charged with possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute for value and theft, based upon information the television was stolen. Defendant moved to suppress the evidence, claiming that the search warrant violated his Fourth Amendment rights because it failed to describe the place to be searched with particularity and did not authorize seizure of the television. The trial court denied the motion. Subsequently, defendant pleaded guilty to several charges, including theft and possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute for value. On appeal, defendant claimed that the search which produced evidence of those crimes violated his Fourth Amendment rights. Because the guilty plea contained no language conditioning the plea on defendant's right to appeal the trial court's denial of the motion to suppress, defendant entered an unconditional guilty plea freely, voluntarily and intelligently, and expressly waived his right to appeal, thus precluding him from raising Fourth Amendment issues on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father had never wed the mother of the child, who was residing with adoptive parents. The father filed an acknowledgment of paternity with the registrar of vital statistics and he filed an affidavit to amend the child's birth certificate to add his name as the father and to give the child his last name. But when he went to the social services agency, he was told it was too late due to the adoption that was arranged. The trial court also held that the matter was not one involving state action. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the matter did involve state action, but nevertheless, the father was not denied any constitutional rights. The father had failed to timely claim paternity rights prior to the date the child was relinquished for adoption, although the father was capable of doing so. However, the action by the social service agency was state action, because the agency acted under a state statute in terminating the father's parental rights. Section 78-30-4 was not unconstitutionally applied to the father, and it did not violate equal protection principles because unwed fathers were treated differently than others.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was properly stopped for a traffic violation. The police officer noticed the odor of alcohol and asked defendant to step out of his car to perform field sobriety tests. Defendant performed poorly and he was arrested. At the police station, defendant submitted to an Intoxilyzer test, which rendered a result of .09 percent blood-alcohol content. He then requested a hearing, pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 41-2-19.6 (1986), before the Utah State Department of Driver License Services (DDLS). At the hearing, no one represented plaintiff city, and it did not have a direct role. Following the hearing, the DDLS examiner determined not to take action to suspend or revoke defendant's driver's license. Subsequently, the trial court convicted him of driving under the influence of alcohol, a Class B misdemeanor. The court affirmed the conviction, by holding that the criminal trial conviction did not constitute double jeopardy because jeopardy did not attach, as the driver's license hearing was civil, and not criminal, in nature. The court also held that the city was not estopped from proceeding with the criminal action because it was not a party in the prior hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The real estate broker was licensed with the Utah Department of Business Regulation's Real Estate Division (division).

The district court reversed. On appeal, the court reversed and reinstated the commission's order. The court held that four brokers on the commission were well qualified to meet the statutory prerequisites for sitting as a panel of the real estate broker's peers. By virtue of Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 61-2-5.5(1)(c), 61-2-12, the commission could delegate a hearing to the ALJ rather than before the commission itself.

The court reversed because the unwed father had a constitutional right to rear his child. There is no public policy that favors the termination of an unwed father's parental rights where the father has a long-standing relationship with the child, is determined to be a fit parent, and where those seeking to adopt the child are strangers who have been deceptive in their adoption plans.</SPAN></P>

Defendant waived attendance at trial, but defense counsel argued that the state had to prove that defendant consumed alcohol within the state and could not rely on a presumption. The trial court found defendant guilty. On appeal, the court reversed defendant's conviction.

The court rejected this argument, holding that conditional pleas were permissible where the State agreed to it and the trial court accepted the conditional plea. The court reviewed the police's observations of defendant's conduct and found that the facts articulated by the police did not justify even the limited stop-and-frisk exception to the Fourth Amendment prohibition on seizing a person without a warrant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1986, the applicant began proceedings to receive disability retirement benefits. The Board denied the application for benefits, finding that the Utah Legislature replaced the disability plan under which the applicant sought benefits, the 1967 Utah State Retirement Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 49-10-1 to -61 (1981), with the 1983 Utah Disability Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 49-9a-1 to -15 (1984). The court affirmed the district court's decision affirming the administrative denial of the application. The Legislature did not impliedly repeal the Retirement Act but expressly replaced the Retirement Act with the Disability Act for disability retirements commencing after July 1, 1983. Thus, the Disability Act governed the applicant's disability retirement benefits, and, because the applicant was not &quot;totally disabled,&quot; he was not entitled to disability benefits. Moreover, the applicant was not deprived of vested contractual benefits because he failed to satisfy the conditions precedent to his disability retirement benefits.
