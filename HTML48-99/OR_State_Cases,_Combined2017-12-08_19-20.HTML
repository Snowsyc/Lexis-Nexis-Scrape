</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer sought review of a decision by the Circuit Court, Lane County (Oregon) that, upon a petition to enforce a labor examiner's order that appellee union cease and desist certain unlawful picketing, sustained the union's demurrer on grounds that the relevant statute was unconstitutional, and dismissed the employer's petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proceeding involved charges of unlawful picketing. The employer alleged that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 662.720(13), 662.730(14), authorizing the enforcement of the labor examiner's order, upon a transcript of the proceedings, was unconstitutional because it contradicted Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 662.780(18), requiring that relief be given upon a hearing in open court. The court ruled that the provisions were not inconsistent. The court held that: (1) it was its duty to adopt an interpretation that would give effect to the entire statute, rather than one that would wreck a substantial part of it; (2) the provisions were not inconsistent because one section applied to original proceedings, while the other section applied to the enforcement of the labor examiner's orders; (3) Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 662.770(17), requiring that representative unions be certified as such before picketing an employee or employer, was unconstitutional because it was a sweeping prohibition of picketing which was not aimed specifically at evils within the allowable area of state control; and (4) the invalidation of &sect; 17 did not render the entire act void because it was separable and independent of the other provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decree and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was indicted for statutory rape upon a female child under 16 years of age. The jury found petitioner guilty of the crime of assault with the intent to commit rape. Petitioner alleged that the sentence for which he was imprisoned was void because he was convicted of an offense greater than that charged in the indictment. The State alleged that the verdict and judgment were authorized by ORS 136.660. The State alleged that assault was a lesser included offense of the crime of statutory rape. The court held that petitioner was entitled to a writ of habeas corpus because, although he was convicted of a lesser crime than rape, his sentence exceeded the maximum sentence for rape. Since the maximum sentence that could have been imposed for the crime of rape was 20 years, the court held that petitioner could not be sentenced to more than 20 years for an assault with intent to commit rape. The court held that ORS 163.270 was unconstitutional to the extent that it permitted a life sentence for the crime of attempt to commit rape.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city port filed an action to enjoin the property owners from maintaining houseboats and moorage structures on the river side of a harbor line established by the port. The property owners argued that they had property rights which could be destroyed without just compensation. The trial court enjoined the property owners from maintaining the moorage, other structures, and houseboats outside of the line established by the port. The property owners appealed from the judgment. The court held that the port authorities' decisions were supported by substantial evidence, and they did not act arbitrarily in determining that the houseboats and moorage facilities constituted a hazard to and an obstruction of navigation. Thus, the court held that property owners had no vested right to occupy the area with obstructions to navigation. Consequently, there was no occasion for exercise of a right of eminent domain. The court held that there was no compensation for removal of floating houseboats. The court modified the decree to enjoin and restrain the property owners from mooring houseboats outside of the port harbor line, or permitting others to do so or renting moorage space for that purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff manufacturers appealed an order of the Circuit Court, Columbia County (Oregon), which sustained defendant city officials' demurrer to the manufacturers' complaint to restrain defendants from proceeding with their complaint or citation and to perpetually enjoin the city from seeking to collect a license fee from the manufacturers on the ground that St. Helen's, Or., Ordinance No. 1241 was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ordinance No. 1241 imposed a flat license fee on businesses operating from regular places of business and a higher license fee on businesses not operating from regular places of business in the city. The manufacturers, having refused to pay the required license fee as set out in Ordinance No. 1241, and being threatened with arrest, filed suit to restrain defendants from proceeding further with their complaint or citation and to perpetually enjoin the city from seeking to collect the license fee. The manufacturers argued that Ordinance No. 1241 was discriminatory because it imposed two different fees and taxied the bakery business and exempted the producers of farm products. The trial court sustained defendants' demurrer, and the court affirmed. The court held that the city was free to select the subjects of taxation and to grant exemptions. Inequalities that resulted from a singling out of one particular class for taxation or exemption did not infringe upon due process or equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 14.220 and 14.230 were unconstitutional. Defendant sought a mandate commanding the trial court judge to hear the motion to set aside the indictment and to proceed with the determination of the criminal action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alternative writ disclosed that defendant was indicted for the crime of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and that while the criminal action was pending on a motion to set aside the indictment before the trial court judge, the district attorney, acting pursuant to the provisions of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 14.220 and 14.230, filed an application in writing requesting a change of judge, and that the trial court judge refused to hear the motion to set aside the indictment or to proceed further in the case solely because of the filing of such application for change of judge. The court found that the statute the constitutionality of which was drawn in question granted the right to a party to a judicial proceeding in the trial court or his attorney to disqualify the judge of the court from exercising his judicial functions in the particular case by merely filing an application for a change of judge. The court concluded that the statute contravened the principle of the separation of powers as declared in Or. Const. art. III, &sect; 1 and was unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 33.710, 33.720, respondent school district petitioned for judicial approval of proceedings authorizing a $ 360,000 bond issue for a new high school. Appellant contestant appeared in opposition.

After the proposed bond issue carried by a vote of 163 to 67, the school district sought judicial approval. The trial court approved the district's actions with respect to the bond election. The contestant sought review. The court affirmed, holding that an issue of school bonds for any of the purposes enumerated in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 328.205 could be validly authorized at an election called for that purpose without the necessity of any other authorization whatever at a school meeting. The contestant further argued that the district was not created and established as a municipal corporation. The court held that the district carried its burden of proving that it was established as a municipal corporation pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 33.710. In this respect, the district was consolidated with another school district in compliance with the statutory requirements of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 330.110, 330.140. Or. Const. art.

He entered a plea of not guilty, was tried by a jury, and found guilty as charged in the indictment. He was sentenced and appealed. Defendant contended that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to try the defendant because OCLA, &sect; 23-402 under which the indictment was brought was repealed before the trial began. The court found that a comparison of &sect; 23-402 with Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.020 disclosed that the essential elements of the crime had not been changed. Defendant also contended that the indictment was insufficient. The court held that under the uniform ruling of the court, defendant by failing to demur under the provisions of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 135.630(2), waived all objections concerning the sufficiency of the indictment as to definiteness and certainty. The court held that the indictment complied with the requirements of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 132.520 to and including Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 132.550, and was therefore sufficient.

Defendant alleged that the retailer was selling goods for less that the manufacturer's minimum retail prices for the goods.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer had entered into written agreements with wholesalers and retailers requiring them not to sell its goods for less that its minimum retail prices. The retailer had not entered into a contract with the manufacturer. The manufacturer sought to an injunction and damages for sales made by the retailer subsequent to July 14, 1952, the date when Congress enacted the McGuire Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 45. The purpose of the McGuire Act was to make fair trade laws applicable to nonsigners. The retailer asserted that it was immune form the Fair Trade Law because it had purchased the goods prior to the date of the enactment of the McGuire Act. On appeal, the court affirmed the decree entered in favor of the retailer. The court held: (1) it was presumed that the legislature intended to adopt a law that met constitutional demands; (2) the Fair Trade Law governed the sale of property purchased after its effective date, and not the sale of property purchased before the enactment of the McGuire Act; and (3) the provisions of the Fair Trade Act did not apply to the property acquired by the retailer before the effective date of the McGuire Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The daughter contended that the restriction upon marriage should not be given effect because it was against public policy and violated her constitutional right to freedom of religion.

The court held that a testator had the right to make the enjoyment of his bounty dependent on the condition that the recipient renounce, embrace, or adhere to a particular religious faith. The court held that conditions to marry or not to marry a person of a particular religion were reasonable. The court noted that the constitutional provisions dealing with freedom of religion, U.S. Const. amend. I and Or. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen argued that the potential candidate should not be allowed to run for circuit court judge because he was not a resident or elector of the county which held the judicial vacancy, as required by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 3.040. The statute required that candidates be residents of their districts provided that districts comprised of one county have a population of 200,000 or more. The citizen argued that the population proviso was unconstitutional. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment. The court found no provision of the state constitution imposing a residence qualification for the office of circuit judge. The citizen also argued that the population proviso contravened Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 because it was arbitrary, discriminatory and constituted class legislation. Constitutional guaranties against so-called class legislation did not prevent the legislature from resorting to classification in order to accomplish a legitimate public purpose. It was a matter of common knowledge that many lawyers who practiced in Portland had their homes beyond the boundaries of the county. The legislature might have wanted to include those from without the county in the judicial elections.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lienor foreclosed mechanic's liens for material it had furnished, and the mechanic's liens were given priority over the liens of certain prior recorded mortgages on the properties involved held by the mortgagee. On appeal, the court affirmed, with modifications. The court held that the lienor's failure to give notice of delivery of the material did not impair the validity of the mechanic's liens. The lienor was properly allowed to amend his complaint, and the amendment related back to the original date of filing. There was no evidence that the lienor intentionally or through culpable negligence overstated its claims, but the estimates of the value of the materials given by an expert witness determined the amount of the mechanic's liens. The claim that the lienor was engaged in a joint adventure was wanting in substance. The court held that the mechanic's liens were preferred as to the building on the land but that the mortgagee's liens for prior recorded mortgages on the land itself had priority over the mechanic's liens.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, as modified, the decrees that foreclosed the lienor's mechanic's liens and granted them priority over the mortgage liens held by the mortgagee.

In defendant's first appeal, the state supreme court concluded that it was the mandatory and constitutional duty of the trial court to dismiss the indictment against defendant. On the State's petition for a rehearing, the court reviewed whether the statute was a binding legislative definition of the constitutional right to speedy trial and holding that it was not, withdrew its prior opinion and affirmed defendant's conviction. The court further held that whether such a speedy trial has been afforded must be determined in the light of the circumstances of each particular case as a matter of judicial discretion and concluded that the constitutional mandate for trial without delay was not violated when a trial court continued a case until the next term based upon its appraisal of the facts concerning the congested condition of the docket.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate commenced a habeas corpus proceeding, apparently against defendant warden, contending that a trial court erred in sentencing him to life imprisonment as a fourth offender under OCLA &sect; 26-2803 (repealed by Oregon Laws 1947, ch 585). He appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court, Marion County (Oregon) that dismissed the proceeding and remanded the inmate to the custody of the warden.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate contended that the fourth court erred in failing to vacate his valid third sentence, which he had served, under the Habitual Criminal Act, OCLA &sect;&sect; 26-2801 to 26-2804 (repealed by Oregon Laws 1947, ch 585), thus requiring his discharge; that he improperly was sentenced as a fourth offender as his third conviction was for a felony that he committed before his second conviction; and that OCLA &sect; 26-2802 (Oregon), dealing with third convictions, was unconstitutional. The court held that the fourth court had knowledge of the third sentence, which was illegal, by the inmate's pleadings. It was the fourth court's mandatory duty to impose a life imprisonment sentence under OCLA &sect;&sect; 26-2803 and 26-2804 (Oregon). The failure to vacate was of no consequence. Though the sequencing of convictions was relevant to sentencing under OCLA &sect;&sect; 26-2801 and 26-2802 (Oregon) for second and third offenses, it only was necessary to show under OCLA &sect; 26-2803 (Oregon) that the inmate had been convicted of three offenses before his conviction for the fourth offense. There was no need to determine if OCLA &sect; 26-2802 (Oregon) was unconstitutional. It would have been severable from the rest of the Act.</SPAN></P>

After the circuit court ruled that the ordinance was invalid and enjoined the city's officials from enforcing it, the city appealed. The court reversed. The ordinance was valid. The ordinance was a tax measure and not one enacted under the police power of the state. It was directed at machines of a gambling or lottery nature and those that did not provide pay-off or free play. The business claimed that the ordinance preempted the regulation of the devices. The court had no basis for inferring that a $ 50 annual exaction was sufficiently large to reduce the number of machines. To the contrary, the court said that it was set in an amount which was intended to yield the largest possible return. The fact that the ordinance would have deprived the state of revenue did not render it invalid.</SPAN></P>

The warden opposed the prisoner's release in reliance upon Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 44.230.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The warden, acting upon the advice of the state attorney general, requested the writ of mandamus to compel the judges to vacate orders requiring the warden to permit the prisoner to testify in favor of the criminal defendant at the trial. The judges filed the general demurrer to the action. The court held that &sect; 44.230 was void when applied to criminal prosecutions. Because it required the imprisoned felon to submit to a deposition rather than testify in favor of the criminal defendant, it violated the accused's constitutional right to meet witnesses face to face and to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor. Those guarantees were contained in Or. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11. The court concluded that the language in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 136.530, which provided the legislative definition and construction of the constitutional provision relating to the right of the accused to meet witnesses face to face, was controlling on the issue. Therefore, the judges had jurisdiction to order the warden to produce the prisoner to give oral testimony on behalf of the defendant at his trial. The writ of mandamus was quashed and the judges' demurrer to the writ was sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that an appeal by the state from the trial court's judgment was not authorized by statute. The court noted that under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.060, the State could take an appeal to the Supreme Court of Oregon from a judgment for defendant on a demurrer to the indictment or from an order of the court arresting judgment. Notwithstanding the fact that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 135.610, 135.620 required that a demurrer be filed in writing, the court held that defendant's objection to the introduction of testimony served precisely the same purpose as a demurrer, which was to challenge the sufficiency of the indictment. The court further held that the purpose of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 135.060 was to authorize the State to bring to the supreme court the question of the correctness of the trial court's ruling sustaining such a challenge. The court reasoned that if that were not so, a defendant could cut off the state's right of appeal by simply postponing the attack on the indictment until after a jury had been impaneled and a witness called to the stand. The court declined to interpret the statute in such a manner, citing case authority from other states interpreting similar statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the predecessor was entitled to occupy the office of county surveyor because he held his office until his successor was legally elected and qualified. On appeal, the elected surveyor argued that he was entitled to hold the office. He claimed that because the office was a constitutional office, and the constitution provided the qualification for the office, the legislature was powerless to prescribe additional qualifications. The court held that the elected surveyor was the duly elected and qualified county surveyor of the county. It could not logically be contended that the legislature would have the right to enlarge the qualifications of the governor or the legislators over and above those specified in the constitution. The language used in Or. Const. &sect;&sect; 2, 6, and 8, arts. VI and V, with reference to the members of the legislature, the governor, and the county surveyor, was in the negative. When the constitution established certain qualifications as necessary for office, it excluded all others as prerequisites. The affirmation of the qualifications implied a negative of all others.</SPAN></P>

It was the use to which the housing authority would put the property, such as to rid areas of conditions that propagated such evils as vice and disease, rather than the length of time the ownership continued that constituted &quot;public use.&quot; The possible subsequent resale of the property by the housing authority did not negate the public use that was made of the property during the elimination of the blight and the imposition of barriers against its return.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both parties, plaintiff operator and defendant director of the department of agriculture, appealed from a decision of the Circuit Court, Marion County (Oregon), which determined that a portion of the Oregon Agricultural Chemical Control Act (Act), 1951 Or. Laws ch. 651, was unconstitutional, but that &sect;&sect; 17-32 could not be challenged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the Act delegated the authority to promulgate regulations without providing for any definite standard in violation of Or. Const. art. III, &sect; 1. The court agreed with the trial court that &sect;&sect; 15 and 34 of the Act were unconstitutional because the Act contained no rule or standard fixed for the guidance of the administrative bodies concerning their rule-making powers. The court disagreed with the trial court's conclusion that the operator could not challenge &sect;&sect; 17-32 of the Act. A justiciable controversy existed between the parties because the director believed the Act to be constitutional and intended to enforce its provisions and the operator was subject to losing his license or face fines or imprisonment for violating the Act. The operator in the operation of his airplanes in an area governed by herbicide restrictions might very well come in conflict with regulations approved by the department of agriculture. As to the regulations themselves, they were invalid because the department of agriculture had uncontrolled and unfettered power under the Act to make rules and regulations governing airplane operators in the application of chemicals.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the next of kin failed to prove that the second adoption met all of the statutory requirements for adoption. The next of kin were required to prove that there was strict compliance with every statutory step required as a condition precedent to the adoption. The court concluded that the record did not establish consent by the decedent to the adoption by the daughter's natural father, that the decedent was not personally served with process in the adoption proceeding and that there was no appearance by the decedent in the proceeding.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff husband brought suit for divorce against defendant wife in the Circuit Court, Washington County (Oregon). The wife filed a cross complaint. After trial, the trial court awarded a divorce to the wife, gave her custody of the minor daughter of the parties, and directed the husband to pay child support. The husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband claimed the trial court erred in refusing to grant his motion for a blood test to establish paternity of the child, and in failing to grant a decree of divorce to him based on evidence offered on the issue of adultery of the wife. The child was born eight months after the parties separated, and the husband claimed evidence that he found the wife in a car with another man was sufficient to raise a reasonable inference of adultery. The court affirmed the judgment. Indiscretion was not adultery. Evidence concerning a single occasion offered to establish both adulterous disposition and opportunity was not sufficient to create suspicion of adultery. It was within the trial court's sound discretion whether or not to grant a motion for a blood-grouping test. The husband and wife were living together nine months prior to the birth of the child. It was within the discretion of the trial court to deny the motion for a blood test. There was no abuse of that discretion when the trial court refused the order based on a claim of illegitimacy that was based on mere suspicion of adultery.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner county district attorney objected, contending that the putative governor was not president of the senate at the time of the governor's absence since the state senate had adjourned sine die, and thus he was not eligible to become governor. An original action was filed. The court held for the putative governor. It ruled that although the state senate had adjourned sine die, it could be recalled into special session, and thus did not expire until such time as the terms of the successor senators began. Consequently, the putative governor was still legally president of the senate at the time the elected governor became absent, and thus he was entitled to become governor.</SPAN></P>

The lessee brought a declaratory judgment action seeking a decree that it did not owe property taxes. The trial court declined to grant relief, holding instead that the lessee was obliged to pay the taxes.

The circuit court held that the former commissioner could not be elected. The appellants sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the former commissioner was not qualified to become a candidate for election to the unexpired term of the office from which he was recalled. By reason of his disqualification, the court opined, his election, if an election were to be held, would be void. The court concluded that a public office was an entity and that the duration of the term of office was a part of the entity and, if an official was ousted from the office, he was also ousted from the term to which he was elected.</SPAN></P>

The parents and students alleged that the rule wrongly interfered with their clubs, which were not secret clubs, and constituted an invasion of parental authority. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the action and stated that the board, in adopting the rule, acted within its authority, and the rule was reasonable and constituted a measure taken in good faith for the purpose of stamping out secret societies in the high schools under the board's jurisdiction. The court noted that the evidence at trial supported the need for the rule because of the harmful tendencies of secret societies. The court found that the rule's interference with non-secret clubs was permissible because there was nothing in the rule that prevented them from engaging in their activities outside of the schools on their own time.</SPAN></P>

Ten days before trial, defendant's counsel gave notice that defendant would plead insanity and sought a continuance. The trial court appointed a psychiatrist, a doctor, and a ballistic expert, but denied the request for continuance. Defendant was convicted and sentenced to death. He appealed, arguing error in the denial of the continuance. The court noted that the request for continuance was based on counsel's affidavit stating that his private practice prevented him from devoting sufficient time to prepare a defense. The court stated that when a lawyer accepted appointment to act as attorney for a defendant, it was his bounden duty to sidetrack his private business sufficiently to properly look after the interests of his client, otherwise he should ask the appointing court to be relived of the appointment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city council passed City of Portland, Or., Ordinance No. 94552 prohibiting punchboards or similar devises designed for distributing money or anything of value. The ordinance became effective immediately based on an emergency clause, which stated that police problems were presented by such punchboards and an emergency existed. In the punchboard distributor's action against the mayor, city commissioners, the chief of police, and the city attorney, the trial court overruled a demurrer and entered a decree invalidating the emergency clause. On appeal, the court reversed and ordered the suit dismissed. The court held that pursuant to common law, a legislative body's determination that a state of emergency existed was conclusive upon the courts. The court stated that the facts warranting the emergency were distinctly specified. The court held that the ordinance language that it was necessary to relieve police problems caused by punchboards without delay constituted a distant and sufficient statement of the reason for the emergency provision. The court stated that the declaration of emergency was not contradictory with the remainder of the ordinance and was not false on its face.</SPAN></P>

The theatre company sought to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance. The trial court denied relief. The theatre company appealed. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded with directions. The court held that the tax was an excise tax, rather than an occupation tax, and could not be enforced. The court noted that the city &quot;license&quot; fee was in excess of what was reasonably necessary for purposes of regulation, and therefore, the ordinance could not be upheld as regulatory measure. The court found that the principal purpose of the ordinance that imposed a &quot;license&quot; tax upon theatrical and other exhibitions, shows, and public amusements was to raise revenue. The court held that the state did not confer power to the city for this type of taxation. The court noted that an &quot;occupation tax,&quot; which the city was authorized to impose, was one levied upon persons for privilege of conducting their established trades, occupations, or businesses.</SPAN></P>

Laws 198 (barber law) related to minimum prices barbers could charge for their services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board members brought their action for an injunction against the barber, alleging that he violated the barber law by charging less than the minimum prices fixed in that law. The barber filed a general demurrer to the action, arguing the barber law was an unconstitutional restriction of his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution to enter contracts and to conduct his business. The trial court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the suit. The board members appealed, arguing that the barber law was a valid exercise of the legislature's police power. The court found that the barber law unreasonably and unnecessarily interfered with the barber's constitutional right to carry on his business and to render his services at prices suitable to himself. The barber law did not have a well-recognized and direct bearing on the health, happiness, and well-being of the public as a whole. The law was a price fixing statute of primary interest to the barber trade itself, so it was not a valid exercise of the legislature's police power. As a result, the barber law was unconstitutional and void, and the suit was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

They alleged that defendants had for some years attempted to seize control of the local union and its funds and prayed for an injunction to require defendants to cease from interfering with plaintiffs in the performance of the duties of their respective positions to which they were elected. The trial court entered a decree in favor of plaintiffs. On appeal, the court reversed. There was no attempt by plaintiffs to exhaust or even make use of the remedies of appeal provided within the constitution of the union, particularly an appeal to the executive council, from the rulings of which they complained. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the court was to assume that the executive council would have performed the duties of its office honorably and conscientiously and that the council was not under the control of defendants.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners argued that &sect; 107-125 was unconstitutional and void because it was grossly disproportionate to the offense of not paying taxes timely and that the penalty should have been waived because of their excusable neglect. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the penalty clause contained in &sect; 107-125 was not oppressive or disproportionate to the evil of nonpayment, which the penalty was intended to have prevented. The court explained that the penalty was imposed in order to spur payment of a tax at the crucial time when the taxpayer had assets in his possession out of which the payment could have been made. The court noted that the care that the legislature exercised in trying to assure prompt payment of the yield tax showed that it had deemed the tax an important source of the public revenue. The court explained that &sect; 107-125 did not contain any provision authorizing any court to remit any part of a tax which it had imposed. Without such a specific provision, the court opined that the state courts had no power to grant relief from a statutory penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dog owner brought an action after the neighbor killed his dog when it was chasing his chickens. The trial court entered a judgment for $ 700 for the loss of the dog. The neighbor asserted that the measure of damages was incorrect for the loss of the dog and the statutory duty that made the killing of the dog inside the incorporated limits of the city was unconstitutional. The court reversed the decision regarding the value of the dog because it determined that the punitive damages were not proper in the case since there had been no showing that the neighbor was acting other than in good faith in the protection of his chickens. Rather than remanding the case for a new trial on damages the court concluded that because all evidence of damage was in the record it could calculate the appropriate damage award and it rendered judgment for $ 250.00 as the market value of the dog at the time it was killed. The court determined that the statutory duty that prohibited the killing of dogs chasing livestock was not unconstitutional because the amendment was within the scope of the original statute so that the amendment covered matters that could have been enacted originally.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a tax foreclosure, the county sold timber on the property at issue to certain individuals. The claimant argued that the procedure employed in the tax foreclosure, the failure to name the true property owner and the flawed property description, did not comply with the law, denied due process of law, and rendered the tax deed void. The court disagreed. In general due process required less in tax foreclosures than in cases involving private obligations. Under the law in effect at the time of the foreclosure, the foreclosure list was not required to contain the names of the true owners. Assessors could not be burdened with the duty of exercising the skill of title searchers. Under &sect; 2-407, subd. 15, O.C.L.A., the court could presume that the assessor performed his duty in entering the name of the prior owner as the owner of the property at issue. If the prior owner had performed the duty under &sect; 110-833, O.C.L.A., of informing the tax collector of the owner's true address, then it would have appeared on the tax rolls. The description was adequate because the trial court could have taken judicial notice of the fact that the property was in a certain county and township.</SPAN></P>

The packing house companies, which purchased livestock from areas outside of Oregon, brought a declaratory judgment action and asserted that the Act did not require a brand inspection of such livestock. The trial court decreed that the brand inspection requirements of the Act applied only to livestock originating within the state. The court affirmed but modified the decree to provide that the brand inspection requirements of the Act applied only to livestock that were a part of shipments originating in Oregon, not specifically excepted by the Act. A &quot;transportation certificate&quot; was only required when the livestock shipment originated at a point in Oregon. The only livestock amenable to brand inspection under the Act were those that were part of shipments originating in the state.

The landlord argued that the trial court erred in denying her motion for a new trial because it was error not to uphold the parties' rental agreement, and the Act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenants rented housing from the landlord and agreed on a monthly rental. Under the authority of the Act, a maximum rent regulation for housing included in defense-rental areas was promulgated, and the tenants' housing was in the area. The tenants paid the agreed rent and filed an action for the amount paid in excess of the maximum legal rate under the Act plus treble the amount of the overcharge, costs, and attorney's fees. The trial court entered judgment for the tenants, and it denied the landlord's motion for a new trial. The landlord appealed, and the court affirmed. The trial court did not err by failing to uphold the agreement entered into between the parties because, under the provisions of the Act, the Act became part of the contract of tenancy. The Act, with respect to the recovery of overcharges, was practically identical to the Housing and Rent Act of 1947, 50 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1895. Thus, the court regarded it as conclusive that the Act was constitutional. The trial court properly took judicial notice that the nation was still on a war footing at the time of the contract. The award of treble damages was not error, and the pleadings sufficiently supported the judgment.</SPAN></P>

In the report, it was alleged that the guardian was entitled to a credit against the estate for legal guardianship fee and commission for services rendered as guardian during the year covered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Objections were made to the account by the Administrator upon the ground that the commission claimed by the guardian was in excess of five percent of the annual income of the estate of the ward, and was therefore in violation of O.C.L.A., &sect; 22-124 (Oregon), as amended by Chapter 273, Laws of 1943 (Oregon). The trial court concluded that the 1943 amendment was violative of Oregon Constitution Article IV, Section 20. The court held that Article IV, Section 20 of the Oregon Constitution contained a double-barreled mandate. First, it mandated that every act was to embrace but one subject, and second, it mandated that the subject of the act was to have been expressed in the title. The court reasoned that the substance of an amending act had to have been germane to the subject of the act to have been amended as that subject appeared in the title. However, the provision of Chapter 273, Laws of 1943 (Oregon), limiting the compensation of the guardian to five percent of the amount of moneys received during the year, introduced a new and different subject that was not embraced in the title of the act to have been amended and which was not a matter connected with the subject of that act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of manslaughter and imprisoned. Petitioner escaped and was recaptured. Petitioner received an additional sentence for his escape. Several years later, petitioner was granted a conditional parole. Shortly thereafter, petitioner's parole was revoked and he was returned to prison. Petitioner was again granted parole, and again his parole was revoked. Petitioner's wife filed an action seeking habeas corpus relief on behalf of petitioner and argued that the lack of notice and a hearing prior to the parole revocation violated petitioner's constitutional due process rights. The trial court denied petitioner's action and petitioner sought review. The court found that petitioner did not have a right to parole or probation, that they were granted solely at the discretion of the state parole board and the governor, that parole was revocable without any prior notice or a hearing, that petitioner agreed to the conditions of his parole, that petitioner had a right to challenge the state parole board's actions as arbitrary and capricious, but that petitioner failed to present any such evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The building contractor did remodeling work for the restaurant. A disagreement ensued over payment, and the building contractor filed a notice of a mechanic's and materialman's lien. The trade fixtures upon which much of the building contractor's labor was expended never became, and were never intended to become, part of the structure. The court found that no lien could be had for that part of the claim; and since that part could not be separated by anything contained in the lien notice from the balance of the account, the lien failed. Thus, the court reversed the lower court's decision upholding the lien. The court further found that the invalidity of the lien and the consequent failure of the building contractor to have established a basis for equitable relief did not warrant the dismissal of his cause. The record showed that the judgment for the value of the labor and materials was without error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was arrested on another charge, he confessed to a particularly gruesome murder of a 15-year-old girl. He entered a plea of not guilty and also gave notice of an intention to prove insanity. Defendant did not testify and the jury returned a verdict of guilty without recommendation of life imprisonment, the effect of which defendant was sentenced to death under Or. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 23-411. On review, the court held that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for an inspection of defendant's confession. The court also rejected challenges to the constitutionality of the death penalty. Although the court agreed with defendant that it was improper for the circuit court to make any statement about the possibility of pardon or parole to the jury, the court held that no prejudice resulted to the defendant from that incident. Last, while acknowledging that some of the exhibits in question, particularly the photograph of the corpse, were gruesome, they were all relevant and, therefore, properly received in evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An unincorporated association filed with the Secretary of State an initiative petition for a proposed constitutional amendment to article IV of the Oregon constitution. By the proposed amendment, the number of senators was to be increased, and the method of determining the ratio of senators and representative was to be changed. The district attorney alleged that the proposed amendment was legally insufficient. The district attorney sought to restrain the secretary of state from certifying the proposed initiative petition. The lower court granted the secretary of state's demurrer to the petition. The court affirmed. The district attorney's principal contention was that the initiative petition submitted three proposed constitutional amendments in the form of one amendment, so that electors would have been obliged to accept or reject all three. However, neither the constitution nor any statute gave power to the courts to declare a proposed law, previous to its enactment, to be either constitutional or unconstitutional. Any interference by the courts with the enactment of an initiative measure would in itself be a violation of the constitutional separation of the powers of government.</SPAN></P>

The driver and the employee worked together in the unloading and weighing of the milk, and a fight broke out between them when the driver objected to the manner in which the employee was handling the milk cans after they were washed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The driver was not entitled to bring an action against a third party under &sect; 102-1752, O. C. L. A.

The court found that the public authorities, within their power, had classified drag seines as fixed appliances and that the prohibition of the use of seines was a reasonable means adopted by the electors in putting the act into effect. The gill-net fishermen argued for rehearing on the grounds that the court had misinterpreted the act in light of Indian treaties, and that although the treaties were signed while Oregon was a territory, none of them were ratified by the President and Senate of the United States until after the date of the state's admission into the Union; therefore any subsequent ratification did not relate back. The court found that the Indians had some rights and that the act was constitutional. Further, the action was properly bought under the uniform declaratory judgments act, &sect;&sect; 6-601 to 6-616, O. C. L. A.

The Commission cross-appealed the portion of the judgment that declared sections of the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fishermen operated fixed gear appliances to take salmon from the Columbia River. The circuit court held that sections 1 and 3, and section 2, as far as it prohibited the taking of salmon, trout, or steelhead by fixed appliances, violated Or. Const. art. IV, &sect; 20, which provided that every act had to embrace one subject, which had to be expressed in the title. The fishermen appealed the finding of constitutionality for the rest of the act and the Commission appealed the finding of unconstitutionality for the remaining portions. Reversing as to the findings of unconstitutionality, the court said that the evidence did not conclusively show that the act failed to meet the test of reasonableness. A presumption in favor of the act had to prevail. Construing sections 1 and 2 separately and with its other sections, the court said that the act's language did not go beyond the scope of its title and did not violate Oregon's Constitution. Rights under previous fishing licenses were terminated by the act. The act did not violate either the letter or the spirit of a compact between Oregon and Washington to regulate, protect, and preserve the fish within the boundary waters of the river.</SPAN></P>

Lastly, the court found that the sponsors' failure to file a proper financial statement with the initiative did not prevent the electors from giving a full, fair, and honest expression of the popular will at the election.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A portion of the city was included within the boundaries of a newly-created parks and recreation district. The state, through its district attorney, alleged that the state legislature was without authority to enact ch. 327, Or. Laws, 1941, which permitted the inclusion of all or part of a municipality in the parks and recreation district. The state filed an action quo warranto to determine the validity of the bond election called and held by the directors and to have determined their validity to have acted as directors of the newly-created parks and recreation district. The trial court upheld the organization of the parks and recreation district, legalized the bond election, and upheld the directors' authority to have exercised the duties of directors of the parks and recreation district. The state appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that the legislature had the power to have enacted the law authorizing parks and recreation districts to have included municipalities, and that there was no violation of the rule against superimposing one municipality on another. The court found that the city's inclusion in the parks and recreation district was valid and not unlawful.</SPAN></P>

The husband filed a cross appeal from the entire decree, which granted plaintiff a divorce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's former husband had died and left plaintiff property. Defendant husband corresponded with plaintiff, he moved to Oregon from California, allegedly on plaintiff's promise to provide for him after their marriage. Both parties were elderly, and plaintiff's second divorce action against the husband occurred approximately one year after the marriage. Plaintiff alleged that her husband cursed at her, took her government bonds and refused to give them back to her, and knocked out lights in their home, which caused her to fall. Plaintiff alleged that her husband failed to help her when she fell. On appeal, the court modified the trial court's judgment to eliminate the cash award to the husband, and affirmed the judgment as modified. Plaintiff was entitled to a divorce, and the husband was therefore not entitled to separate maintenance. The husband was not entitled to the cash award because plaintiff's evidence showed that he had already received over half of her net income during the marriage. The husband's evidence consisted of approximations or speculations as to plaintiff's net income, which could not support his claim for his interest in the community of parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the lower court. The court reasoned that the county had properly assessed fees against the association's members. The court rejected the association's argument that a motor vehicle dealer was not a retail merchant within the generally accepted definition of that term. The court noted that the difference argued by the association did not exist. The court noted that not only motor vehicle dealers, but also all retail merchants, paid freight charges on their goods. The association also argued that they were required to accept vehicles turned in for the purchase of new ones. The court noted that many merchants, such as furniture, radio, and appliance, were required to &quot;take in&quot; used in part payment for new merchandise. The court concluded that each class of business had its own distinct problems. The court recognized that probably most of them could have made out a case for separate classification as plausible as that presented by the association.

The merchants contended that the circuit court erred in failing to find that the practical denial of the opportunity for the people to invoke the referendum against the 22 ordinances rendered the same unconstitutional and void. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that there was nothing in the record before the court which would have justified a finding that the license tax imposed upon various classes of businesses, professions, trades, and callings was in violation of the equal protection, due process, or uniformity clauses of the state and federal constitutions. Further, the court reasoned that all presumptions and intendments were in favor of the constitutionality and validity of the ordinances. The court found that the city council did not record a complete catalogue of the considerations, which moved its members to enact the ordinances, and in the absence of such a record the court could not assume that its action was capricious.</SPAN></P>

On review, the only issue concerned the constitutionality of Portland, Or., Ordinance No. 76339, &sect; 16-617. Reversing, the court held (1) that the words &quot;lawful purpose,&quot; as used in &sect; 16-617, were not so indefinite as to invalidate the ordinance, as the constitutionality of other statutes that made the absence of lawful purpose or the presence of an unlawful purpose an element of a statutory offense had been repeatedly upheld; and (2) that &sect; 16-617 bore a sufficiently close relation to the peace, safety and welfare of the public so far as to justify the inconvenience to which law-abiding citizens were occasionally subjected to under it.</SPAN></P>

Defendants' motion to strike some parts of the amended and supplemental complaint and to make other parts more certain was denied. Their demurrer on the grounds that the trial court had no jurisdiction over the action and that the complaint did not state a cause was overruled. On appeal, defendants contended that the trial court erred in denying their motions directed against the employer's amended and supplemental complaint, and that 1947 Or. Laws ch. 355 was not applicable to the action or was unconstitutional. The court held that a demand by a union upon an employer that he unionize his shop, followed by his refusal to do so, constituted a labor dispute within the conception of Or. Comp. Laws.

The corporation alleged that it was a charitable organization and was exempt from taxation in the State of Oregon. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court regarding the corporation's non-exempt status from taxation. The court reversed the portion that declared that the corporation was charitable because there was no justiciable controversy as to the taxability of the corporation since the corporation was not incorporated under the laws of Oregon. The court rejected the corporation's argument that O. C. L. A., &sect;&sect; 110-101 et seq. was intended to include foreign corporations doing business in the state because the language of the statute was plain and a reading that the corporation sought would defeat the purpose of the tax exemption statute. The court found that O. C. L.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The relator argued that the judge erred when he refused to set aside the service of the complaint and summons and that O. C. L. A. &sect; 1-403 discriminated against nonresidents of the state and was, therefore, unconstitutional. The court found that 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 321(c) dealt with venue as distinguished from jurisdiction over a cause of action and held that Congress, without violating any constitutional provision, could require a carrier engaged in interstate commerce to appoint in each state in which it operated a process agent and submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of every state in which it operated. The court further held that the fact that the parties to the personal injury action were not residents of Oregon and that the injury did not occur in the state did not prevent the plaintiff from filing his action in the state. The court further held that O.C.L.A. &sect; 1-403 did not deny to nonresidents the equal protection of the law because, in the process of classification for venue purposes, the legislature had a right to view nonresidents different from residents, and to deem venue immaterial to them.</SPAN></P>

The county court refused to include that amount in its budget and contended that it did not have to allow a state agency to usurp the powers of local government by dictating the amount to be raised through local taxation. The court awarded judgment in favor of the commission. The court held that the county court was expressly imposed with a duty to levy the amount mandated pursuant to &sect; 126-110. The court found that the purpose of the law was to give aid to needy persons on the basis of statewide standards, but because the number of persons entitled to aid differed in every county and because the amount of necessary funds for such standardized relief bore no proportionate relation to the taxable value of property within a county, the uniform relief to needy persons could only be given if the amount of relief to be raised was determined by the need in each particular county, according to the statewide standards.</SPAN></P>

The order also dismissed the city's appeal. The city had filed a complaint charging defendant bookmaker with violating &sect; 16-1122, a city ordinance, by conducting a horse racing bookmaking establishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court focused on the issue of the validity of the ordinance. The bookmaker conceded that bookmaking was gambling but that the Oregon Racing Act, with subsequent amendments found in Or. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 91-901 et seq., had legalized bookmaking on horse races when conducted away from the race track and pursuant to what was commonly known as the pari mutuel system. The court ruled that the circuit court erred in sustaining the bookmaker's demurrer to the complaint. The court held, based upon an analysis of the Oregon Racing Act, the applicable principles of statutory construction, and other decisions, that the only effect of the Act, was to except regulated pari mutuel wagering at a licensed race track from the operation of the Oregon Nuisance Statute, leaving that statute otherwise in full force and effect. Thus, the city was free to pass an ordinance making it unlawful to conduct a bookmaking establishment or to sell pools upon animal races, excepting therefrom pari mutuel betting at the race track or at race meets conducted under the supervision of the Oregon Racing Commission; and the ordinance did not conflict with the state law or state policy.</SPAN></P>

The court observed that the judge, who recused himself and was the judge who denied the change of venue, also later did become a material witness at the trial. The court rejected defendant's arguments and affirmed the conviction in favor of the state. The court concluded that the record established that defendant received a fair and impartial trial before a special venire. The court explained that although it assumed that the minor was a &quot;party&quot; to the action under the change of venue statute, it nevertheless did not follow that a change of venue as a matter of right existed where a judge disqualified himself from a case. The court found that the prohibition against a party in a case acting as a judge with regard to such case, did not apply to an application for a change of venue or any other regulation of the order of business in the court. The court explained that this was the case because ministerial acts left nothing to judicial discretion.</SPAN></P>

Upon the filing of the complaint and answer, both parties moved for judgment on the pleadings. The trial court dismissed the action. On appeal, the court found that the use of an income tax surplus for general fund purposes did not violate Or. Const. art. IX, &sect; 3. The income tax surplus funds were not devoted only to a special purpose. There was reason to believe that the surplus from the excise tax of 1929 would take care of a so-called deficit, even if the surplus from the personal income tax were held to be limited by the title to property tax reduction.

The court held that the charge and penalty were exercises of police power, not of taxation. Therefore, the fact that the penalty was not assessed on all forest lands did not violate Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 32 or Or. Const. art. IX, &sect; 3. The penalty was assessed to compel payment, not to generate revenue. Further, the owners had discretion not to pay any part of the charge by joining a fire patrol association. The court held that the Tithing Act was not another mechanism for obtaining the penalty. Although it and the amendment to Or. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 107-243 were passed on the same day, they had different purposes.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment to defendants. The court affirmed, holding that the measure did not violate plaintiffs' privacy and confidentiality rights under either Or. Const. art.

The court held plaintiff's claim was untimely because it was filed 85 days after judicial approval upon dismissal of his initial appeal, at which time plaintiff knew that defendant's pre-election constitutional evaluation was complete. The fact that plaintiff's claim for declaratory relief remained justiciable following the election did not justify a post-election time limit for its commencement because the statutory post-election procedure was entirely separate and distinct from the procedure that was judicially established for pre-election challenges.</SPAN></P>

The trial court concluded that appellant was in arrears, and noted that though he had in fact overpaid in the past, it lacked jurisdiction to rule on the merits of future support payments. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the explicit language of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25.330 forbade the trial court in an arrearages action from considering objections going to the merits of a support judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner district provided educational and support services to several school districts. Respondent union represented an employee bargaining unit in petitioner 's special education division, and filed a unit clarification petition seeking to add early childhood interventionists (interventionists) to the &quot;academically licensed&quot; unit. The Employment Relations Board (Board) determined the interventionists were &quot;academically licensed&quot; and thus appropriately included in the unit. The Board subsequently certified the results of a self-determination election by the interventionists. Petitioners sought judicial review, contending the Board's decision, that the interventionists were &quot;academically licensed,&quot; was error. The court affirmed, resolving the ambiguity in the phrase &quot;academically licensed&quot; in Or. Rev. Stat. 243.650(1) by construing it to mean, not that the persons described must be both academically trained and also licensed by a competent legal authority, but that the persons described must be entitled to engage in a particular occupation or profession by reason of academic training.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment to plaintiffs on their contract claims, but then granted partial summary judgment to defendant on the wage claim, finding that plaintiffs' damages were limited because of a wage increase during the period of alleged breach.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner corporation sought review of a declaratory ruling of respondent agency. In the ruling, respondent concluded that a city sewer system was &quot;available&quot; to petitioner under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 454.655(4) and Or. Admin. R. 340-071-0160(5)(f). This meant that under the statute and the rule, petitioner was not entitled to a permit to repair and enlarge its septic tank and drainfield sewage system but had to connect to the city's system. On review, the court affirmed. The critical issue was whether the city sewer system was &quot;available&quot; to petitioner under &sect; 454.655(4) when the city's willingness to provide sewer service, which was necessary for the system to be &quot;legally available&quot; under Rule 340-071-0160(5)(f), was contingent on petitioner's agreement to annexation to the city. To answer the question, the court discussed the methods for determining the meaning of &sect; 454.655(4) and the agency's authority under it. Respondent's ruling interpreted an inexact term in a way that was consistent with legislative policy and provided a basis for determining the meaning of an ambiguous word. The requirement of annexation did not mean that a central sewer system was unavailable to petitioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the declaratory ruling that concluded that a city sewer system was &quot;available&quot; to petitioner. The legislature did not intend that a requirement of annexation to the city meant that a central sewer system was unavailable to petitioner. It also affirmed the rejection of petitioner's constitutional challenges. There was nothing unconstitutional about the annexation requirement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before trial, defendant sought to waive his right to jury trial and to be tried by the court. Plaintiff state objected and demanded a jury trial pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 136.001(1). The trial court denied the demand, because &sect; 136.001(1) was found to be unconstitutional. Plaintiff sought a continuance, but the trial court denied the postponement. The trial court then dismissed the charge with prejudice because plaintiff would not proceed. Plaintiff appealed the trial court's order dismissing the complaint against defendant. The court found that the reviewability of the underlying jury trial ruling was moot because &sect; 136.001(1) was unconstitutional. Further, the court found that the trial court abused its discretion by not postponing the trial because the nature of the interest that plaintiff was asserting was a particularly weighty one because the state was entitled to a jury trial at that time. The court concluded that the issue was one of statewide importance and that interlocutory appellate review through an original writ of mandamus was the best and perhaps only vehicle to obtain appellate court resolution of the issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent claimant was awarded unemployment benefits after he was discharged from his position as a youth minister with petitioner church. Petitioner sought judicial review, claiming that Or. Admin. R. &sect; 471-031-0090 (1996), which was promulgated to include ministers within mandatory unemployment coverage, violated U.S. Const. amend. I, and that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 657.072(1)(b), which granted an exemption from such coverage for ministers, was constitutionally valid. Respondent claimant cross-appealed the denial of attorneys' fees and interest on the award. In affirming the award, the court ruled that &sect; 657.072(1)(b) was unconstitutional because it improperly distinguished between churches and other religious organizations. While petitioner had a right to autonomy in decisions regarding ministerial employment, &sect; 471-031-0090 presented a permissible balance that protected the state interest in economic security and it did not interfere with such employment decisions. There being no statutory authority for attorneys' fees, the denial of it was affirmed. However, interest was authorized by Or. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Corporation was a lessee of an unpatented mining claim. An &quot;unpatented&quot; mining claim is a possessory interest in minerals only, with the federal government retaining ownership of the land on which minerals may be located. Plaintiff developed a plan of operations for a copper ore mining project that required plaintiff obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit and to discharge groundwater pumped from the mine into the North Santiam River Subbasin (river). A basin rule prohibited any new waste discharges into the river. Plaintiff's application for an NPDES permit was denied. Plaintiff alleged claims for relief under the takings clauses of Oregon and federal constitutions. Plaintiff claimed that denial of its NPDES permit rendered its unpatented mining claims valueless and thus constituted a per se taking. Defendant State of Oregon moved for summary judgment on the ground that denial of the NPDES permit took no property right of plaintiff's. The court affirmed summary judgment. Plaintiff's takings claim was predicated on the loss of a right that it never possessed, namely, the &quot;right&quot; to discharge mining wastes into the waters of the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to the annexation of property by the Portland Metropolitan Area Local Government Boundary Commission (Oregon) (commission), voters approved two city charter amendments that prohibited annexation without voter approval unless mandated by state law. Petitioner sought judicial review of the annexation orders, arguing that the orders violated the home rule provisions of Or. Const. art XI, &sect; 2 because the orders were not approved by the voters. The court affirmed the orders, holding that there was no conflict between state and local law where the charter amendments permitted boundary changes as mandated by state law. The court explained that state legislation created the commission and authorized the commission to annex the property, which was within the commission's jurisdiction and was in accordance with statutorily prescribed procedures. Thus, annexation was proper under the charter. Alternatively, the order was binding as a matter of state law because opportunities to object to the order had expired under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 199.505(1).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions from the Circuit Court, Marion County (Oregon), for possession of a weapon by an inmate, pursuant to Or.

Laws 313, &sect;&sect; 8, 9a and b.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's trial for the crimes underlying his convictions for possession of a weapon by an inmate pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.275, the prosecutor exercised his authority under subsection (1)(g) of Ballot Measure 40 and requested that the trial court exclude any prospective jurors who were not registered to vote or who had prior felony convictions. The trial court granted the request. Later the 1997 Legislative Assembly enacted Senate Bill 936 that amended Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 10.030 to conform to subsection (1)(g) of Ballot Measure 40. 1997 Or. Laws 313, &sect;&sect; 8, 9a and b. Thereafter, Ballot Measure 40 was declared unconstitutional. Defendant put forth three arguments related thereto. The appellate court examined only the argument that the provisions of Senate Bill 936 limiting jury pools to registered voters and those persons not convicted of felonies were unconstitutional. The requirement that jury pools were chosen from registered voter lists did not by itself offend U.S. Const. amend VI. The fact that prospective jurors had been convicted of felonies and/or were not registered voters did not logically make such persons a cognizable group for U.S. Const. amend. VI purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for possession of a weapon by an inmate. The requirement that the eligibility of persons to act as jurors in a criminal trial was conditioned on their registration as voters did not itself offend the U.S. Constitution. Prospective jurors convicted of felonies and/or not registered to vote were not a cognizable group for purposes of the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before a local general election, a mailing and newspaper advertisement were published, warning voters about unions buying elections.

The court, after reviewing relevant federal case law on the subject, concluded that &sect; 260.044 required an expenditure report if the publication was in support of or opposition to a candidate and the message clearly and unambiguously urged the election or defeat of one or more candidates and sought action rather than simply gave information.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City of Eugene, Oregon passed a &quot;Right to Know&quot; initiative designed to promote public health and safety by regulation and imposition of reporting requirements on businesses that used hazardous materials within the city. The appellants, various businesses, brought an action challenging the validity of the initiative. The trial court rejected all twelve counts of the appellants' action for declaratory and injunctive relief; four of the twelve were addressed in the instant appeal. The court found that the trial court erred by not granting summary judgment to the appellants as to three of the four claims. The court determined the initiative was invalid as to its fee requirement because of Oregon state law. The court found that portions of the initiative aimed at regulation of pesticides were preempted by state law. The court also held that certain provisions constituted unlawful prospective delegation of legislative authority. A due process challenge based on the U.S. Const. amend. XIV was rejected. The court therefore reversed the trial court in part, remanded in part, and affirmed in part.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff convict appealed an order of the Circuit Court, Marion County (Oregon), dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed on the ground that the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision allegedly failed to follow Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.125(3) (1991) and the applicable administrative rule, Or. Admin. R. 255-60-006 (1988), in extending his parole release date for two years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff convict was imprisoned and shortly thereafter, the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision set his parole release date. Shortly before his parole release date, a psychologist interviewed plaintiff and prepared a report. The Board then issued an order extending plaintiff's parole release date by two years, without first determining that the psychologist had diagnosed plaintiff with a severe emotional disturbance that constituted a danger to the health or safety of the community, as required under an administrative rule then in effect, Or. Admin. R. 255-60-006 (1988). Plaintiff petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus. The trial court denied the petition holding that the applicable statute,&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.125(3) (1991), did not require the Board to make its determination from the psychological report alone. The appellate court reversed holding that, during the period that the applicable administrative rule was in effect, the rule required the Board to treat the statute as requiring a formal finding in the psychological evaluation as a prerequisite to the Board's authority to extend a prisoner's parole release date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's dismissal of plaintiff's habeas corpus petition, holding plaintiff was entitled to relief. It held that because an administrative rule in effect at the time of plaintiff's offenses was more favorable to plaintiff than the court's later interpretation of the underlying statute, it would be an unconstitutional ex post facto violation to apply statute rather than administrative rule to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state appealed two judgments of the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon) that sentenced defendant on convictions that were based on two counts of second degree robbery, under Or.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 164.405(1)(a), defendant was convicted on two counts of second degree robbery. The court imposed probationary sentences instead of the 70-month minimum sentence mandated by &sect; 137.700(2)(r) (1995). Both plaintiff state and defendant appealed the sentence. After defendant violated his probation, the court revoked the probation and imposed six-month sentences rather than imposing the minimum sentence of &sect; 137.700(2)(r). Plaintiff appealed the judgment. The appellate court dismissed the appeal of the first judgment, as moot, because defendant's probationary sentences no longer existed. The appellate court held that plaintiff's appeal on the second judgment was reviewable because retroactive application of &sect; 138.222(4)(c) did not violate due process and operated to authorize the appeal. The appellate court held that the mandatory minimum sentence of &sect; 137.700(2)(r) was not unconstitutional to defendant, under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, because the sentences were not so disproportionate to the offense as to shock the moral sense of all reasonable persons. The sentence was vacated and remanded for imposition of the mandated sentences under &sect; 137.700(2)(r).</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 137.700 was cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of Or. Const. art.

The lower court imposed 10-year probationary sentences, and appellant state sought review of the judgment. The court on review concluded that the mandatory sentence for sexual abuse of children was not unconstitutionally cruel and unusual because the record showed that respondent had a history of initiating unwanted sexual contacts for a period of over 30 years and had been in mental health treatment during most of this time. The judgment was reversed and remanded for resentencing under the mandatory minimum sentences required by the statute.</SPAN></P>

The estoppel operated then on two fronts, because plaintiff had received a benefit, and defendants had relied on the compact to their detriment. The court held that the proper method for plaintiff to have challenged the alleged illegal conditions was via appeal to the land use board of appeals within 21 days of receiving the notice of final approval for the projects. The court stated that alternatively where a claim was based on a development condition that resulted in the actual acquisition of a private property interest by the government, rather than a speculative &quot;taking&quot; based on a zoning plan, plaintiff could have proceeded directly to court.

Rejecting petitioner's constitutional challenge to statutory procedure, the appellate court affirmed the decision, holding that because the disability determination was directly driven by medical and vocational inquiries, an evidentiary hearing would not significantly advance the decision, nor did its absence subject the outcome to an unacceptable risk of error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Balancing the low value of oral testimony against the burden of a trial-type administrative process, the court affirmed the decision awarding petitioner permanent partial disability on grounds that petitioner received constitutionally adequate procedural protections under the existing scheme, given the procedures in place that allowed for wide-ranging documentary proofs, counter-proofs, and other responsive submissions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state appealed the pretrial order of the District Court, Multnomah County (Oregon), which granted defendant's motion to suppress and dismissed the charge against him for driving under the influence of intoxicants in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 813.010.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's car was stopped by a state police officer for a traffic violation. After learning that defendant did not have license, the officer asked defendant to step out of his car. Defendant was ultimately arrested and charged with driving under the influence of intoxicants under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 813.010. Pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;810.410(3)(b), the trial court issued a pretrial order suppressing the evidence obtained after the officer requested that defendant step out of his car and dismissing the charge against defendant. The trial court held that the officer did not have a reason related to the traffic violation to request that defendant exit the car. On appeal, the court vacated the order. Under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 136.432, the evidence could not be excluded on ground that it violated a statutory provision unless the exclusion was required by either the federal or state constitution. There were no findings of fact as to whether the officer compelled defendant to act or merely made a request to which defendant consented. Because the resolution of that issue depended in part on factual determinations, the case was remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient suffered injuries when defendant/cross-appellant physician failed to diagnose his condition. The failure to diagnose was contributed to by defendant pharmaceutical company's promotion, which endorsed its drug as a safe drug, and which type of promotion had been the subject of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) letter of adverse findings. The FDA letter, along with evidence of defendant's knowledge about the condition from which plaintiff became harmed, was sufficient to create a jury question as to whether defendant knowingly withheld or misrepresented information known to be material and relevant. Plaintiff and defendant/cross-appellant entered into a covenant not to enforce judgment. Generalities of the agreement were revealed to the jury, but the court did not err in limiting defendant's cross-examination on details of the agreement or settlement amount. Defendant/cross-appellant prayed for punitive damages in its original pleading; a request to modify amounts prayed for was not prejudicial, and was properly allowed. A punitive damage award was not unconstitutionally excessive where it was based upon misconduct of the defendant against whom it was assessed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment in favor of defendant/cross-claim plaintiff physician was affirmed where defendant pharmaceutical company's promotion led to defendant/cross-claim plaintiff's failure to diagnose plaintiff patient. Cross-examination regarding a covenant not to enforce judgment and a settlement were properly limited; and an amendment to a pleading, which only changed the amount of punitive damages requested, was not prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court, Douglas County (Oregon), that entered a conviction against defendant for murder and sentenced defendant to life imprisonment with a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years. Defendant contended that the mandatory minimum sentence was unconstitutional and that life imprisonment sentence was unconstitutionally disproportionate under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.115 and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years. Defendant argued that the mandatory sentence was unconstitutional and that the sentence of life imprisonment was unconstitutionally disproportionate under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The appellate court agreed that the life imprisonment provision of &sect; 163.115(5)(a) was facially unconstitutional and, therefore, remanded the case for resentencing. The court held that a statutory scheme that provided a greater penalty for a lesser-included offense than for the greater offense violated the state constitution. Since murder was a lesser-included offense of aggravated murder, then the &quot;imprisonment for life&quot; provision of &sect; 163.115(5)(a) was constitutionally flawed. The court concluded that the proper sentence was the 25-year mandatory sentence required by &sect;&sect; 137.700(a)(A) and 163.115(5)(b), followed by post-prison supervision for life. The lower court properly imposed the sentence, and the only erroneous term in the judgment was the reference to imprisonment for life.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals remanded defendant's sentence for murder for resentencing and otherwise affirmed the lower court's decision that convicted defendant of murder. The appellate court found that the lower court properly imposed the 25 year mandatory minimum sentence required by statute followed by post-prison supervision but that the court erred in the court's reference to &quot;imprisonment for life.&quot;</SPAN></P>

An award of over $ 22 million in compensatory and putative damages for plaintiff was affirmed. However, an award of over $ 400,000 in economic damages for plaintiff's wife resulting from her decision to take early retirement to care for her husband was reversed because lost income was not damage recoverable as part of a claim for loss of consortium. Admission of Food and Drug Administration letters charging defendant with misleading promotion of its drug of last resort was harmless in light of other admissible evidence. Admission of a press release from a senator charging defendant with an abusive promotional campaign was not reversible error because defendant did not properly object to the document. Violation of FDA regulations by defendant was evidence that defendant breached a standard of care established by those regulations. Plaintiff testified that if warned of the danger of blindness, he would have sought treatment earlier when he began having problems with his eyes. Punitive damages were appropriate given the state's interest in deterring reprehensible behavior that results in blindness.</SPAN></P>

Appellant state argued the trial court lacked jurisdiction to modify the sentence. The court agreed with appellant, holding that the trial court's jurisdiction ended when appellee was delivered to the corrections division to begin serving the initial sentence imposed. In addition, the court noted that once appellee challenged the sentence, the trial court lost jurisdiction, and could only resentence if the case had been remanded or the initial sentence had been vacated.

Defendant doctor's motion to modify the noneconomic damages award to comply with the limits of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18.560 was denied. The statute was later found constitutional, and the trial court granted defendant doctor's motion to modify or reconsider the motion. The appellate court affirmed and held that the trial court had jurisdiction to modify the judgment because a final judgment against all parties was not entered. The seriatim judgment rule did not apply because each of the underlying judgments was not entered in the register. The clerk's entry of an order of dismissal as to defendant medical center did not satisfy the requirement. The &quot;notation of the filing&quot; prescribed in Or. R. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant insurer had issued an automobile policy and umbrella policy to plaintiff and her decedent husband. Under then-applicable law, defendant was also obligated to offer underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage under plaintiff's umbrella liability policy, but never did so. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 742.468 was eventually enacted which exempted umbrella liability policies from mandating kinds or amounts of coverage in auto liability policies. Plaintiff's husband was subsequently killed in an auto accident, from which she collected under her auto policy, but also made a claim for UIM benefits under the umbrella policy, which defendant denied. Plaintiff brought suit and was awarded UIM benefits under the umbrella policy. On appeal, the court affirmed by finding that because defendant breached its statutory duty to offer UIM coverage, the remedy was to impute such coverage. Also, the enactment of &sect; 742.468 did not abrogate existing UIM coverage under plaintiff's umbrella policy because nothing in the text, context, or legislative history of that statute suggested the legislature intended that the statute would alter or eliminate existing coverage obligations. The decision below was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order requiring defendant insurer to pay $ 1 million in underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage under an umbrella liability policy it issued to plaintiff and her decedent husband was affirmed because defendant had a statutory duty to offer such UIM coverage under the umbrella policy. Because it did not, such coverage was imputed to plaintiff, and a statute's enactment did not abrogate her existing UIM coverage under the policy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prosecution appealed the order from the Circuit Court, Douglas County (Oregon), suppressing evidence of a controlled substance that police officer discovered during the search of defendant's vehicle on the ground that police officer's request for consent to the search violated Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 810.410(3)(b), alleging that the search did not violate &sect; 810.410(3)(b) or that suppression was no longer proper under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 136.432.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped by a police officer for a traffic infraction. After the stop, officer turned off his overhead lights, returned defendant's identification documents to him, issued a citation, and ended the stop. Defendant had reached down and was starting to move the gearshift when officer recontacted him and asked if he could talk with him. Approximately seven seconds had elapsed. Defendant agreed to talk to the officer and got out of his car. The ensuing conversation led to defendant's consent to a search of his car and the subsequent discovery of the controlled substances under the back seat of the car that were the subject of the trial court's order on appeal. Defendant contended that the state's argument that the evidence was admissible under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 136.432 was not preserved below to the trial court and should not have been considered under Or. R. App. P. 5.45(2). Prosecution could not have raised &sect; 136.432 to the trial court as authority for its position because the statute had not yet been enacted at the time that the trial court entered its order suppressing the evidence. It was error to suppress the evidence because it was admissible under &sect; 136.432.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the order suppressing evidence of a controlled substance found during a consensual search of defendants' vehicle, holding prosecution could not preserve the issue under the applicable statute because the statute had not been enacted at the time that the trial court entered its suppression order and that, under the applicable statute, the evidence obtained was admissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile appealed from the sentence imposed by the Circuit Court, Clackamas County (Oregon) on defendant's conviction for murder. Defendant contended that imposing a sentence under the sentencing guidelines violated statutory protections for juveniles provided in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.620.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile was convicted of murder and sentenced under the sentencing guidelines to 116 years incarceration. Defendant appealed the sentence, arguing that the sentence violated Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.620, which provided that a sentence imposed on a juvenile remanded from juvenile court could not include any sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release or parole, and that he could not be sentenced under the guidelines because its determinate sentencing scheme was a mandatory minimum sentence prohibited by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.620. The court concluded that the legislative intent of the statute was that remanded juveniles not be sentenced to incarceration for the rest of their lives without having the possibility of release, and that defendant's sentence was effectively life imprisonment without the possibility of release or parole. The court found that a determinate sentence under the guidelines was not a mandatory minimum sentence within the meaning of the statute, therefore defendant could be sentenced under the guidelines. Defendant's conviction was affirmed, his sentence vacated, and the matter was remanded for resentencing under the guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction, vacated the sentence, and remanded for resentencing, finding that based on the plain language of the statutes, the legislature intended that remanded juveniles not be sentenced to imprisonment for the duration of their lives without having the possibility of release, and that defendant's sentence of 116 years was in practical effect imprisonment for life without the possibility of release or parole.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother sought review of an order of the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon), which dismissed her motion to increase child support payments from respondent father for a child who turned 18 years old and was attending school, and which declared that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 107.108, authorizing the increase, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother was divorced from respondent father and appellant was awarded custody. When a child became 18 years old, the mother moved to increase child support. The trial court ruled that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 107.108, authorizing child support payments for children between 18 and 21 who attended school, was unconstitutional and dismissed appellant's motion. The court held that respondent had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute; that married parents who lived together were given an immunity from the obligation to support similarly situated children; and that respondent was a member of a &quot;true class&quot; of divorced parents of children attending school. However, the court held that there was a rational basis for the distinction because legislators could have believed that the statute advanced the state's interest in having parents support their children attending school. The court held that the statute did not violate Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. Because suspect classifications and fundamental rights were not involved, the court held that the statute did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The legislature declared that appellant university was no longer a state agency, but an independent public corporation.

The trial court found that defendant made no furtive gestures during the stop and that neither the fact that the car was stopped in front of a known drug house nor the fact that defendant had been found in possession of less than an ounce of marijuana provided justification to search the pack. Upon review, the court found that defendant was at all times polite and cooperative and neither officer believed that defendant posed an immediate threat to them or to anyone else. They only believed that the fanny pack contained a weapon, which was insufficient to justify an expansion of a traffic stop investigation beyond the infractions for which defendant was stopped.

In the Marion County action for judicial review, the trial court concluded that the department of education properly approved the private education program's application for registration as an alternative education program. In the Deschutes County action, the trial court concluded that the district and the named board members were authorized to fund the private education program with public funds. The trial court entered judgments in both cases dismissing all claims. On appeal, the two cases were consolidated and the court reversed the dismissal of the Deschutes case and affirmed the dismissal of the Marion case. The court held that the trial court did not err in affirming the department of education's order. As to the Deschutes action for declaratory and injunctive relief, the court concluded that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the district and named school board members because the undisputed facts show that they failed to satisfy statutory conditions for paying public funds to private alternative education programs.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the summary judgment motion of the consumers and sellers and granted the summary judgment motion of the state. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that, consistent with concerns about the availability of gasoline to farms and ranches, the legislature rationally could have provided the exemption from the 2,400-gallon requirement to ensure gasoline availability from sources other than storage tanks that were to be eliminated. The legislature could rationally have concluded that allowing employees of businesses, government, and non-profit corporations to pump gas into their company cars created fewer safety concerns than compared to dispensing by individuals for general consumption. The legislature could rationally distinguish between gasoline stations further than seven miles apart and those within seven miles of each other, in light of concerns about availability of gasoline to rural consumers.</SPAN></P>

The court found substantial evidence suggesting that the inmate's confinement was not the result of the challenged disciplinary order but was the result of subsequent misconduct. Also, the court found that the imposition of a fine upon the inmate did not constitute further imprisonment or deprivation of a right requiring immediate judicial scrutiny and thus determined that this was not a proper subject for a habeas corpus petition. The court rejected the argument that the alleged infringement of the inmate's rights was a proper subject of habeas corpus because it involved an issue capable of repetition yet evading review, noting that this was not an argument recognized by the State of Oregon.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged that defendant had failed to disclose numerous material defects and nonconformities when he sold the truck to plaintiff. At trial, defendant denied knowing of defects or having any reason to suspect that the truck had defects.The trial court noted that the record supported what was &quot;an extraordinarily egregious violation&quot; of the UTPA. The court agreed, stating that there was evidence from which the jury could have found that defendant knew of the extensive defects of the truck and of its branded title and odometer discrepancy, and that it concealed those facts from plaintiff. There was evidence from which the jury could have concluded that defendant's treatment of plaintiff was not an isolated incident in that it had established business procedures that it could employ to cover any failure to disclose. There was evidence that defendant also used abusive tactics to cover its deceptions. Furthermore, from the evasive, inconsistent, and implausible explanations given by defendant's representatives as to defendant's business practices, the jury could infer that defendant had no intention of altering its practices in the future.</SPAN></P>

R. 291-024-0020(3)(d)(D); 291-024-0065; 291-024-0070 and 291-024-0080 of the Oregon Administrative Rules.

I, &sect; 8, and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The journalists attacked the constitutionality of the rules pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 183.400. They asserted that the rules limited freedom of expression because execution invitees could not reveal the identity of persons involved in the execution process. The parties agreed that the threshold issue was whether the execution of an inmate was an &quot;adjudication&quot; under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court determined that an execution was not an &quot;adjudication&quot; and therefore the journalists did not have a right under &sect; 10 to view the procedures leading up to an inmate's execution. With regard to the validity of the administrative rules, the court found that the interests of safety of prison personnel outweighed the interest of reporting the identity of those involved in the execution process. The court affirmed and determined that Or. Admin. R. 291-024-0017(2)(b), (c) and (e); 291-024-0020(3)(d)(D); 291-024-0065; 291-024-0070 and 291-024-0080 did not violate Or. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, age 17, brandished a knife and demanded that the victim give him his money. Defendant was charged with first-degree robbery. He ultimately pleaded guilty to a lesser-included charge of second-degree robbery. Defendant had no prior charges or convictions. The trial court sentenced defendant to 70 months, pursuant to the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions of Ballot Measure 11, codified at Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.700 et seq. On review, the court affirmed. Defendant's articulation of the relationship between his rights to due process, the cruel and unusual punishment provisions of the Oregon Constitution, and the voting rights guarantees of the twenty-fourth amendment was not entirely clear. The court found that the facts of the case warranted the punishment because the robbery involved the use of a deadly weapon. The punishment did not violate the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed a judgment by the Circuit Court, Clackamas County (Oregon), which sentenced defendant to 60 months' imprisonment for second degree robbery pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.610.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state argued that the sentencing court erred in failing to impose the 70-month mandatory minimum for the crime of second degree robbery required by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.700(2)(a)(R). The sentencing court held that the mandatory minimum sentences provided by &sect; 137.700 were facially unconstitutional because the statute violated the separation of powers provisions of the state constitution by reducing the sentencing court's discretion in determining appropriate sentences and because the sentencing scheme as applied would often violate the proportionality provisions of both the state and federal constitutions. On appeal, the court disagreed and reversed defendant's 60-month sentence. The court rejected defendant's argument that that application of the amended version of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.222 to his appeal violated the ex post facto provisions of the state and federal constitutions. The court ruled that &sect; 138.222 concerned reviewability of sentences, not their appealability. The court reasoned that the amended version of &sect; 138.222 merely gave it the ability to correct an error that otherwise was correctable by a different appellate court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voter challenged petition signatures for a tax initiative on the ground that the signature gatherers were not registered voters. The trial court denied the voter's motion for expedited consideration, and the initiative was placed on the ballot and passed while the voter's challenge was pending. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the secretary and dismissed the complaint. The court held that the violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 260.560 and Or. Admin.

The court reasoned that the defect was not the type that would have misled the voting public as to the substance of the initiative itself. The court then held that the collection of the signatures did not amount to fraud because voters neither relied on the collectors' status, nor were they damaged by the violation, and that the collection of the signatures did not violate Or.

On appeal, defendants argued that the district court's decision could not be reconciled with three decisions from the court. The court held that defendants fired at least 125 rounds of ammunition from late night to the early hours of the morning. They fired across a public roadway and in the direction of a residence. The noise was loud and could be heard at least two miles away. Members of the public lived well within the range of hearing. As in one of the cases examined, although the conclusion was not compelled, a rational trier of fact could have determined on the facts that defendants' acts created a risk of public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm. That was sufficient to justify the jury's verdict; therefore, the court affirmed the judgments of the district court.</SPAN></P>

It argued that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 656.262(10) should be applied retroactively to permit it to contest an unappealed-from compensation order. The employee argued that &sect; 656.262(10) was unconstitutional under the Equal Privileges and Immunities Clause, Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>

Her claim was closed following a determination order for five percent loss of her right knee, and neither party appealed. She later required right knee surgery, which the employer contested. The board reversed an administrative law judge's ruling, and held that the employer's denial was not barred. After the court remanded the case to the board with instructions that the employer was barred from contesting the claim, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 656.262(10) was amended to permit an employer to contest a claim unless a condition was formally accepted. On appeal, the court held that the amendment was retroactive and applied to the employee's claim unless the employee demonstrated that the statute was unconstitutional under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. The court concluded that the legislature's purposes in treating an employer differently was rationally related to its goals of decreasing litigation and providing prompt compensation for a permanent disability.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had raised the affirmative defense of insanity at trial. On appeal, defendant challenged a jury instruction that had been given pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.327, which advised the jury of the consequences of a guilty except for insanity finding. Defendant argued that the giving of the instruction, which could have induced the jury to consider the possibility that an insanity finding instead of a conviction would have lead to defendant's release, violated his due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV and his right to an impartial jury under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Or. Const. Art. I, &sect; 11. On appeal, the court found that the instruction violated Or. Const. Art. I, &sect; 11.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed from an order of the District Court, Jackson County (Oregon), which granted defendant's pretrial motion to suppress evidence of his alcohol-related impairment. Defendant was charged with driving while under the influence of intoxicants. The state contended that 1997 Or. Laws ch. 313, &sect; 1, although enacted after the trial court's decision, compelled reversal of the suppression order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant successfully argued below that evidence of his intoxication was fruit of the poisonous tree. On appeal he asserted that 1997 Or. Laws ch. 313, which limited the exclusion of evidence in a criminal action, was inapplicable on various constitutional grounds. The court reversed the trial court's judgment, ruling that the statute was retroactively effective. The court rejected the argument that 1997 Or. Laws ch. 313 was intended to be dependent on the applicability of a ballot measure mentioned in its relating clause. The relating clause was not part of the statute itself and did not constitute part of the law. Next, the court applied a two-part test and determined that the statute did not violate the one-subject rule of Or. Const. art. IV, &sect; 20. The court also rejected defendant's contention that the application of 1997 Or. Laws ch. 313, &sect; 1 to his case violated the prohibitions against ex post facto laws in the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order which granted defendant's motion to suppress. The case was remanded and the trial court was instructed to make findings regarding the police officer's actions, to rule on the constitutionality of the officer's actions, and to determine whether to suppress the previously excluded evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder and the circuit court, concluding that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.700 et seq., was unconstitutional, imposed an indeterminate life sentence with a minimum sentence of 25 years pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.115. Defendant appealed from the sentence, asserting that &sect; 163.115 had been found to have been impliedly repealed. The court noted that the Oregon Supreme Court previously ruled that &sect; 163.115, which provided an indeterminate life sentence for murder, had been impliedly repealed by enactment of the sentencing guidelines, which established determinate presumptive sentences for murder. The court then held, after examining the applicable legislative history and determining legislative intent, that the legislature's subsequent amendment of the section had the effect of reviving and reenacting &sect; 163.115.

He was convicted of rape and burglary and sentenced on the rape conviction to a 30-year indeterminate term as a dangerous offender with a 60-month minimum and a consecutive determinate 6-month term on the burglary conviction. His petition challenged the sentence for the rape conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his petition for post-conviction relief, petitioner argued that his sentence was illegal for failure to comply with a rule that limited the maximum indeterminate sentence he could receive to 400 percent of the presumptive sentence on the primary offense. The presumptive sentence under the rape guidelines was 50 to 60 months, and petitioner's trial attorney had objected to the length of the sentence based on a different 200 percent rule for single offenses. Petitioner did not raise the 400 percent argument in his direct appeal. The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the petition. The court held that petitioner could not raise the alleged illegality of his sentences in a post-conviction proceeding because he could have raised the issue at trial and on his direct appeal but did not do so. In addition, petitioner did not allege that his trial and appellate counsel were inadequate, nor did he argue that there was a change in the controlling law after his trial or appeal or any other event that justified an exception to the general requirement that he preserve the issue in the trial court. Therefore, the court held that petitioner was not entitled to post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. IV, &sect; 1. The court held that the Oregon Constitution conferred on initiative petitioners the right to gather signatures in common areas of large shopping centers, subject to time, place and manner restrictions. The court found that the record supported the jury's finding of a false arrest. The court held that the jury's award of punitive damages was within the range that a rational juror would be entitled to award on the record as a whole. The court found that the initiative petitioner's noneconomic harm, her right to participate in the Oregon political process guaranteed by the Oregon Constitution, was great.</SPAN></P>

After a show-cause hearing in which appellant testified to three instances of contact with appellee, the trial court issued a permanent stalking protection order (SPO) under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.738(2)(a)(B) enjoining appellant from intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly having any contact with appellee or his family. On appeal, the court reversed and ruled that there was insufficient evidence to find that the identified contacts were &quot;unwanted and repeated&quot; as required by the statute. The court noted that to avoid a conflict with the guarantee of free expression in Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.738 had to be construed to require that the alleged stalker intended his expressive conduct to threaten another person and also that the alleged stalker had the means to carry out the threat. The court concluded that, of the three incidents in the record, only one incident fit those requirements and the trial court therefore erred in issuing the SPO.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to assault in the fourth degree, in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.160(1), and agreed to enter into the DSP. His DSP was revoked for violations, and he was convicted and sentenced. The court dismissed defendant's appeal from the revocation of the DSP, holding that the order was non-reviewable. The text of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.050 authorized limited review of sentences that occur after the trial court has entered a judgment of conviction on a guilty plea. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.053 added to that authority by making reviewable probation and suspended sentence proceedings that resulted directly in sentences that exceed the maximum allowable by law. Defendant's argument on appeal, that the trial court erred in revoking his DSP because he failed to comply with its condition that he enroll in an English language class and because he was not furnished with a competent interpreter at the revocation hearing, reached beyond the authority of the statutes authorizing an appeal.</SPAN></P>

The money was confiscated and the trial court entered an order of forfeiture. The court affirmed, finding that although the scope of the traffic stop had been improperly expanded, the claimant's consent to the search was constitutionally valid. The officer lacked authority to question the claimant about subjects unrelated to the traffic infraction as he had not developed a reasonable suspicion that the relevant individual had committed a crime nor had the stop concluded and the claimant given a reasonable opportunity to move on. However, there was no evidence that the officer's actions impaired the claimant's free will, as the officer did not coerce claimant to obtain his consent, he was the only officer at the scene, and was not acting in an intimidating manner toward claimant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the trial court had erred when it imposed the sentence of probation rather than the mandatory minimum sentence of 70 months incarceration required by Or.

Stat. &sect; 137.700(2)(a)(G) on the ground that that statute was facially unconstitutional. The court reversed the sentence and found that because defendant's conviction was classified in the sentencing guidelines grid block 8-H of Or. Rev.

The activist argued that issuance of a permanent stalking protective order (SPO) on the basis of the &quot;contacts&quot; alleged and proved offended the free expression protections of both the Oregon Constitution and the United States Constitution. The court found that where predicate &quot;contacts&quot; involved expression, a civil SPO could constitutionally issue only if that expression or other associated conduct so unambiguously, unequivocally, and specifically communicated the activist's determination to cause harm that an objectively reasonable person in the physician's situation would have feared for her personal safety or for the safety of a member of his or her immediate family or household. The contacts between the physician and the activist did not meet that requirement. He had no history of violence, he did not incite violence, and the demonstrations had been peaceful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim's mother and defendant lived together for most of the victim's life. The victim testified that defendant was like a stepfather to her. The victim and her mother had recently moved out of defendant's residence and were sharing a house with defendant's brother. The victim testified that, while the brother was in jail, she and her mother looked through his backpack and found five pairs of the victim's underwear, which caused them some concern. Subsequently, an unidentified person told the victim that defendant had a homemade videotape that, in part, recorded the brother while he was masturbating. Defendant showed the victim approximately five seconds of the videotape. Defendant subsequently was convicted by a jury of endangering the welfare of a minor in violation of &sect; 163.575(1)(a). The court reversed and held that the legislative history made clear that the phrase, &quot;witness an act of sexual conduct,&quot; in &sect; 163.575(1)(a) referred to acts of live sexual conduct. Thus, because it was undisputed that the victim did not witness an act of live sexual conduct, the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court, Umatilla County (Oregon), which entered summary judgment against defendant in his post-conviction action to obtain reversal of his prior convictions for rape, sodomy, and sexual abuse because the action was untimely. Defendant asserted that the time limitation for filing post-conviction petitions under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.510(3) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of crimes in 1987, and in 1995 he petitioned for post-conviction relief alleging that his trial counsel was constitutionally inadequate. The trial court granted summary judgment against defendant on the ground that the petition was not timely filed under &sect; 136.510(3). Defendant appealed and the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the imposition of a one-year limitation period under &sect; 138.510(3) for filing of post-conviction petitions, concerning convictions that already had been filed at least four years, was a reasonable limitation. The court stated that the limitation period contained in &sect; 138.510(3) was, in effect, a five-year limitation period, which was a sufficient time within which to consider whether a post-conviction claim was available. The court further held that an escape clause, such as the one contained in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.510(2), was not necessary to sustain the constitutionality of &sect; 138.510(3) under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. Simply because defendant felt &quot;no pressing need&quot; to file a post-conviction petition did not mean that it was unreasonable for the legislature to have imposed time limitations.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in dismissing the action on mootness grounds. The union's declaration that it would not engage in the challenged conduct in the future did not render moot the action for injunctive relief. However, the trial court did not err in failing to certify a class of defendants. The union was not a proper class representative because the corporation sought to certify a class of all persons who might seek to petition at its stores; the union had only stated that it would petition at some, but not all of the stores.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon), which dismissed the indictment of defendants for violation of the Oregon Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The trial court held that the racketeering alleged was money laundering, which it held was not a crime under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.715(6)(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the state could not prove racketeering under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.720 because the pattern of activity alleged to be racketeering was money laundering. The state argued that the definition of racketeering in 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1961 was incorporated into Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.715(6)(b) by reference and that the reference was to the current version of the statute, which had been amended to include money laundering. The court held that the trial court properly struck the money-laundering allegations from the indictment. The court held that an incorporation of another statute by reference meant that the other statute's provisions were incorporated in the form in which they existed at the time of reference and not as subsequently modified. The court held that if the incorporation by reference meant the state law could change when the federal statute was modified, the Oregon statute would have violated the Oregon Constitution's prohibition on delegation of legislative power. The court held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 174.060, which provided that incorporations by reference included subsequent modifications, did not apply to statutes that referred to non-Oregon law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee appealed from a summary judgment entered by the Circuit Court of Marion County (Oregon) in favor of defendant county, which dismissed the employee's personal injury claims on the ground of statutory immunity pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.265(3)(a). The employee claimed that the dismissal was in error because the statute granting immunity to the county was unconstitutional pursuant to Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landfill corporation employee was injured while on the job at a county waste disposal facility. He collected workers' compensation benefits for the injury and sought to recover against the county as well for its alleged negligence. On appeal, the court upheld summary judgment in favor of the county on the employee's claim pursuant to the Oregon immunity statute,&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.265(3)(a), which provided public bodies and their employees acting within the scope of their employment with immunity from liability for any claim for injury to any person covered by any workers' compensation law. The court explained that &sect; 30.265(3)(a) was not facially invalid pursuant to Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, which guaranteed to every man a remedy by due course of law for injury done to him in his person, property, or reputation. Rather, the immunity statute violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, only if its effect was to render the tort victim without a remedy. Because the employee in the case at bar collected substantial workers' compensation benefits, the court reasoned that the immunity statute did not have an unconstitutional effect on the employee because he was not wholly without a remedy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of the county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents sought to adopt the children of the mother and the father. The mother's affidavit stated that the father had failed to contact the children since shortly after the divorce. No document in the adoption file indicated service on the father or any attempt to serve the father with notice of the proceedings. Two years after the judgment of adoption was entered, the father filed a motion to vacate the judgment because he did not know about the adoption until the mother sent him a copy of the adoption judgment. The trial court denied the motion because the father had not filed his motion within one year, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.381(3). The court reversed the judgment and held that the father, who had not received notice of his children's adoption until two years after the adoption, was denied due process of law in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court also held that &sect; 109.381(3) was constitutional under Or. Const. art. III, &sect; 1 because the statute did not validate a void judgment, but merely imposed a time period within which the judgment could have been challenged, which was a proper exercise of legislative authority.</SPAN></P>

After determining defendant was a danger to himself, the officer took him into custody for the purpose of detoxification. At the police station, the officer conducted an inventory of defendant's personal belongings, pursuant to Gresham, Or., City Code &sect; 2.80.874. In the search of defendant's fanny pack and wallet, the officer found methamphetamine, drug paraphernalia, drug records, and cash. Defendant was arrested for possession of a controlled substance and delivery of a controlled substance. A subsequent search of defendant's apartment yielded more illicit materials. The evidence seized as a result of the apartment search led to the counts of possession and delivery of controlled substances and endangering a minor. At trial, defendant unsuccessfully moved to suppress the evidence discovered during the inventory and the apartment search. On appeal, defendant asserted the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress. The court affirmed because the officer, reasonably concerned for his safety, was authorized to wait to inventory defendant's personal property at the police station.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The outdoor media company owned three billboards. On the first billboard, the company placed a religious message on one side and an advertisement for a radio station on the other. The state notified the company that its billboard violated the Oregon Motorist Information Act (OMIA), Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 377.700 to 377.840 and Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 377.992. The company attempted for several months to obtain a permit and removed both signs from the billboard. The company filed an action against the state. The state moved for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. On appeal, the court found that there was no conversion since the company took none of the actions available under the statute, and the state was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Further, the court found that because the state had authority to remove the structure, the company was not entitled to a declaratory judgment. The court held that the company was not denied its right to free speech. The court found that the trial court properly granted the state's motion for summary judgment on the civil rights action.

The court vacated defendant's conviction and remanded the case for further findings on defendant's motion to suppress evidence because the trial court erred by applying the federal &quot;apparent authority&quot; standard to find that the ward's consent justified the search instead of Oregon's &quot;actual authority&quot; standard, Or.

The court stated that there was not a warrant prior to the dog sniff and the police did not suggest that there was probable cause to believe that evidence of a crime would be found at defendant's storage unit.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parishioner appealed the dismissal by the Multnomah County Circuit Court (Oregon) of his complaint in an action against defendant, the Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon (archdiocese), regarding sexual assault by his parish priest. The parishioner's claim was brought under the doctrine of respondeat superior and under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12.117 as a negligence claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parishioner alleged that he had been sexually assaulted as a minor by a priest. The parishioner settled his claim against the priest and his religious order. On appeal, the court affirmed dismissal of the complaint against the archdiocese. The court held that the complaint failed to allege a respondeat superior claim because it merely asserted a legal conclusion that the priest's manipulations were generally of a kind and nature that he was required to perform as part of his employment duties. The court also held that the parishioner's claim was untimely under &sect; 12.117 because he failed to allege that the archdiocese had actual knowledge that the priest was abusing children and allowed the abuse to continue. Instead, the court found that the parishioner merely alleged that the archdiocese knew enough about child abuse in the church generally that it should have known the risk this particular priest presented. The court did not address the archdiocese's argument that allowing a negligent retention, supervision, and training claim would interfere with its First Amendment rights regarding internal policies and practices of a religious institution.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the statute was constitutional and that the trial court had erred by allowing the demurer. After concluding that the statute focused on the effect of speech, rather than speech itself, the court analyzed the statute for overbreadth, and found that the statute could have been narrowly construed to prevent its application to protected speech. The court found that the statute's provisions, when taken as a whole, made it clear that a threat or its equivalent must have been made for the crime of stalking to have been committed, and that the victim's apprehension of harm to himself or a family or household member must have been subjectively experienced, objectively reasonable, and intended by the maker.

He alleged the trial court erred by denying a continuance so that he could hire substitute counsel. He also argued that he was unconstitutionally sentenced to 70 months in prison under Ballot Measure 11, a voter initiative mandating minimum sentences for certain felonies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Eight minutes before trial, defendant told the trial court that he wanted to fire his appointed attorney and hire another lawyer. Defendant had become dissatisfied with counsel a week and a half before when he learned that he had failed a polygraph test. On appeal, defendant argued the trial court was required to inquire into and evaluate the merits of his complaints about counsel before denying his request for a new lawyer. The court disagreed. This requirement only applied where an indigent defendant requested that substitute counsel be appointed. The court noted that a motion for a continuance to hire an attorney was addressed to the trial court's discretion. It was not an abuse of discretion to deny a continuance that was requested on the day of trial where, as here, defendant had a reasonable opportunity to obtain counsel but had failed to do so because of his own lack of effort. Defendant's argument that imposition of a 70-month sentence pursuant to Ballot Measure 11 violated the &quot;separation of powers&quot; principles of Article III, &sect; 1, and the &quot;reformation clause&quot; of Article I, &sect; 15, of the Oregon Constitution had been rejected by the court in two prior decisions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted a writ of mandamus that directed the city to place the initiative on the ballot, but denied attorney fees to the prevailing parties. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 34.210(2) in denying attorney fees to the prevailing parties. The prevailing parties' success in securing a broader public benefit militated in favor of an award of fees pursuant to &sect; 34.210(2). However, this success was not dispositive or exclusive and other factors were properly considered, such as the objective reasonableness of the losing parties' refusal to perform the act that was ultimately mandated. The prevailing parties obtained mandamus in an extremely close issue of first impression and the losing parties' failure to act was not grounded in an unreasonable interpretation of complex state statutes and local ordinances. An award of attorney fees under such circumstances could have had the undesirable effect of discouraging agencies from vigorously advocating reasonable policy positions in the courts.</SPAN></P>

The court on appeal affirmed the judgment of the trial court based on its determination that (1) &sect; 137.700 met defendants' single subject challenge because of the statute's logically unifying principle requiring minimum sentences for all person who committed certain violent felonies; and (2) the Oregon legislature's determination that a certain sentence was required to be imposed on a convicted individual did not violate the separation of powers requirement because it was within the legislature's powers to establish criminal penalties and did not impair the judiciary's power to adjudicate, pronounce a judgment, and carry it into effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's entry of a summary judgment upon the claims that &sect; 423.549 was unconstitutional. The question before the court was whether Ore. Rev. Stat. &sect; 236.610 created a contract between the union and the state. The court cited cases for the proposition that a contract would not be inferred from any legislation unless that legislation unambiguously expresses an intention to create a contract. The court found that both parties' interpretations of &sect; 236.610 were feasible, and, therefore, the statute could not be considered unambiguous and did not create a contract. Consequently, the union did not have statutory contract rights subject to impairment by Ore. Rev. Stat. &sect; 423.549. Because no contract was created, &sect; 423.549 could not be found to violate Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and, there being no contract rights, there was no property right under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 236.610. The repeal of the transfer provision as to state parole and probation officers did not constitute a legally cognizable injury to the union for which the law was required provide a remedy.</SPAN></P>

ORS 161.635 deprived the district court of jurisdiction of such misdemeanors committed after August 18, 1993.

The circuit court found that the 1995 amendments to ORS 46.040 retroactively validated the district court's jurisdiction. That argument was rejected by the court in another case in 1995. The State contended that petitioner was barred from raising the issue because he could have raised it before the district court or on direct appeal. The court concluded that although the effective date of the district court's loss of jurisdiction was August 18, 1993, it was not generally recognized until the court's decision in February of 1995. Petitioner's circumstances showed a claim that could be raised in a post-conviction proceeding, even though it was not raised at trial, on appeal, or alleged that petitioner received ineffective assistance of counsel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that the manufacturer was liable and the consumer and his wife were entitled to compensatory and punitive damages.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff political action committee brought an action against defendant, the Oregon Secretary of State, seeking a declaratory judgment under Or.

The Circuit Court, Marion County (Oregon), entered judgment for defendant and upheld constitutionality of the challenged laws. The committee appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the trial court, the secretary of state argued that the committee lacked standing to bring the action on behalf of its members, and that the challenged statutes,&nbsp;Or.

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment for the secretary of state, but on alternative grounds. The committee lacked standing to bring a declaratory judgment action under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28.020 on behalf of its members. The court did not reach the constitutional issues decided by the trial court. Section 28.020 did not make any mention of representational standing and that the court could not read such standing into the statute. The court concluded that because the committee alleged in its complaint that the challenged statutes violated its members constitutional rights, and that it was seeking to vindicate its members rights rather than it own rights as an organization, it lacked standing under &sect; 28.020.</SPAN></P>

Defendant did not appeal the order but returned to the square the same day, where he was arrested and charged with trespass in the second degree. Defendant also failed to appeal the exclusion order. Defendant challenged Portland, Or., Code &sect; 20.12.240 on the ground that it was unconstitutionally vague. Assuming that defendant could even raise the issue without exhausting his administrative appeal, the court held that the ordinance provided the flexibility needed to address a variety of situations that could arise in an urban park setting. The ordinance did not grant unbridled discretion because it required the officer's discretion to be &quot;reasonable&quot; and, therefore, it was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was later tried on two counts each of manufacture, delivery, and possession of a controlled substance, based on his connection with the plants and baggies found at the residence. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the civil forfeiture and later criminal prosecution punished him twice for the same crime, in violation of his double jeopardy rights. The trial court denied his motion, and he was convicted of two counts of the manufacture, delivery, and possession of a controlled substance. The court affirmed the judgment, by holding that defendant's double jeopardy rights were not violated by his criminal prosecution because the State's civil forfeiture statute did not constitute &quot;punishment,&quot; in that it served nonpunitive goals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was crossing a street in a marked crosswalk with an activated walk signal when she was hit and killed by a bus driven by the public employee.

Stat. &sect; 30.265(3)(a) (1989) unconstitutional and remanded. The trial court awarded the representative special and general damages. The court affirmed. The representative's claims against the municipal corporation under the doctrine of respondeat superior and against the bus driver, who was acting in his official capacity as a public employee, were claims within the scope of the Oregon Tort Claims Act (OTCA). The representative's recovery was subjected to the liability cap of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.270.1 (1989). The court determined that the estate's medical and burial expenses and pecuniary loss were special damages under the OTCA. Pursuant to the parties' stipulation as to the value of the decedent's lost future earnings minus future expenditures, the trial court properly treated the pecuniary loss as an item of special damages under Or.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A complainant notified the police that defendant had sexually abused several boys. The police cited defendant for driving violations and subsequently arrested him for the sexual abuse. He denied abusing the boys but admitted that he had a large collection of pornographic videos. Defendant signed consent forms permitting the police to search his trailer and van and never voiced any objections to the searches. Before trial, defendant moved to suppress the videotapes seized from his trailer, and the trial court denied the motion. Defendant was convicted and appealed. The court held that defendant's consent to search was not obtained in violation of his right against unreasonable search or seizure and was not obtained by exploitation of the allegedly unlawful conduct, an arrest without probable cause. The simple fact that, but for the arrest, defendant would not have been in the presence of the police was not enough to render evidence discovered in a subsequent consent search inadmissible. Defendant's convictions for furnishing obscene materials to a minor were reversed because the statute on which the convictions were based, Or. Rev.

The term &quot;annexation&quot; was used to describe the process of extending boundaries, not defining permissible or permitted uses of the land. The circuit court committed error in denying the declaratory action because the property owner's complaint did present a justiciable controversy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee had a compensable injury and the insurer declined to pay benefits for services provided by the doctor she selected because he had not been approved as a treating physician and the employee allegedly had exhausted her three choices without approval by the insurer or the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. The Director determined that employee had not exhausted her right to select three different attending physicians; thus, she could select her physician without approval. The insurer then paid for the medical services. In affirming an administrative law judge's dismissal of employee's request for attorney fees, the Board found that, to trigger the portion of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 656.386(1)(1993) on which employee relied, there had to be an order or decision before it denying a claim for compensation. Because there was no such order before the Board, it concluded that attorney fees were not authorized. The court agreed with the Board's conclusion, affirmed the order, and also found that employee could not complain that her right to such fees was unconstitutionally eliminated by the retroactive application of the 1995 amendments to &sect; 656.386(1).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City enacted an ordinance imposing a tax to be collected by hotel and lodging operators. The operator filed a declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance because it contained an emergency clause, in contravention of Or. Const. art IX, &sect; 1a. The operator filed a motion for summary judgment, but the trial court dismissed its action and sua sponte granted summary judgment to the City. The operator appealed. The court vacated the judgment. The court held that although the operator was a corporation, it had standing to challenge the ordinance. The operator argued that inclusion of the offending emergency clause rendered the entire ordinance unconstitutional. The court held that the trial court had properly concluded that although the emergency clause was invalid, the remedy was to sever the offending clause from the remainder of the ordinance. The court held that the trial court erred in dismissing the operator's action because an action for declaratory relief could be dismissed only if there was no justiciable controversy, and remanded for entry of judgment deciding the constitutionality of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

Immediately upon entry, the officer saw defendant standing inside a doorway and ordered him to the ground. Defendant cooperated and was handcuffed. After a few minutes, another officer assisted defendant to his feet in order to move him out of the way. As defendant stood up, an officer saw a small bag sticking out of defendant's pocket, which bag contained methamphetamine. Defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction and remanded the case. The court stated that because handcuffing defendant constituted an unlawful seizure, any evidence that resulted from that handcuffing should have been suppressed. The court stated that there was no indication that the owner of the house was armed and dangerous or that the officers searching the house reasonably feared for their immediate safety. The court found that the facts articulated by the State did not establish that handcuffing defendant was justified by a reasonable belief that he posed an immediate threat to the officers' safety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was arrested for driving while under the influence of intoxicants.

The driver again sought review and argued that the arresting officer did not have probable cause to arrest him until after the officer had conducted an illegal search by administering field sobriety tests. The court found that the arresting officer did not &quot;actually&quot; believe that he had probable cause to think that the driver was intoxicated when he asked him to perform the field sobriety tests. The court noted that to satisfy the subjective prong of the probable cause test, the officer must have consciously decided that he had probable cause to conduct the search before he conducted it.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court, Clackamas County (Oregon), which ordered the forfeiture of the claimant's interest in currency and a pager following an in rem forfeiture proceeding instituted by plaintiff city under 1989 Or. Laws 791.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was stopped for speeding, consented to a search, and told the officers that he had a large amount of cash. The officers also found heroin. The city obtained a judgment of forfeiture pursuant to 1989 Or. Laws 791. In a separate proceeding, defendant was convicted of possession of heroin. The court reversed the conviction and held that the claimant's motion to suppress evidence should have been granted. The court affirmed the forfeiture and held that the ruling in the criminal case regarding the admissibility of the evidence was immaterial because the claimant stipulated in the forfeiture hearing to the findings of fact from the motion to suppress. The forfeiture proceeding did not violate the claimant's right to be free from double jeopardy where the jeopardy from the criminal prosecution was vitiated and the claimant did not receive multiple punishments for the same offense. The forfeiture statute's authorizing of a penalty without dollar limit was not, in itself, a sufficient basis from which to conclude that the proceeding was criminal and the claimant was not entitled to the full panoply of constitutional criminal protections in the forfeiture proceeding.</SPAN></P>
