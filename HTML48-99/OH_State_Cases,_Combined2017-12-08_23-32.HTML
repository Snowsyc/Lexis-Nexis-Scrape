<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed a decision of the Cleveland Municipal Court (Ohio), which granted defendant's motion to dismiss an action against him that alleged he was pandering obscenity under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.32(A)(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant worked as a clerk or cashier and was arrested for pandering obscenity under &sect; 2907.32(A)(4) when officers seized a copy of a film from where he worked pursuant to a search warrant. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, contending, inter alia, that he was denied equal protection of the laws because projectionists were protected from such prosecutions under the exemptions of &sect; 2907.35(C). The trial court granted the motion, and the State appealed. The court reversed and remanded, holding that defendant, who never claimed to be a projectionist, claimed he was within the class whose rights were violated by &sect; 2907.35(C), but the exception had been held invalid in a prior case. Since defendant had always been subject to the statute, and because the exemption for projectionists was nullified, defendant was not denied equal protection of the law, and his motion to dismiss had been improperly granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a decision of the Common Pleas Court of Franklin County (Ohio), which found him guilty of possession of heroin in an amount equal to or exceeding bulk amount but less than three times bulk amount.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that where the affirmative defense of possession for personal use was sufficiently raised by the defendant and no evidence of a sale or intent to sell a controlled substance was presented by the prosecution, the verdict of guilt for aggravated trafficking was not supported by the evidence. The court found that defendant suggested that the legislative intent was to require that the State prove beyond a reasonable doubt that intent to sell existed while defendant was in possession. The court rejected the argument concluding that such a suggestion required adding an additional element to the crime charged herein. The court found that the trial court charged correctly on the principal offense, including the affirmative defense that the heroin was for defendant's personal use, and also the lesser-included offense of drug abuse. The court found that on the issue of whether or not the heroin was for personal use, an officer's testimony were properly admissible because it concerned matters which were not within the knowledge of the average juror and the witness was properly qualified as an expert by virtue of knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, Attorney General, State of Ohio, a city, a city manager, a charitable solicitations commission, and a city solicitor, sought review of a decision by the Court of Common Pleas Hamilton County, Ohio, which found the Charitable Solicitations Ordinance, Cincinnati, Ohio, Municipal Code ch. 821 to be unconstitutional and made permanent the temporary injunction sought by appellees, an organization and an applicant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction concerning ch. 821, alleging that ch. 821 was unconstitutionally void. The Attorney General filed a counterclaim alleging that the solicitation conducted in 1974-75 by the applicant on the organization's behalf was a violation of Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act, Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 1345 and was contrary to public policy in Ohio, fraudulent, and a breach of fiduciary duty. When the court compared the definition given &quot;charity&quot; by the city council in enacting Cincinnati, Ohio, Municipal Code ch. 821, the court found that while it was comprehensive, it adopted words which were so ingrained in the English language and so commonly used by American people that no citizen of ordinary intelligence would be required to speculate as to their meaning and import. Thus, the trial court erred in finding it to be vague and indefinite. Because the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV did not take from the city or state the power to classify in the adoption of police regulations but admitted the exercise of discretion in that regard, the court held Cincinnati, Ohio, Municipal Code ch. 821 to be a valid exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings according to law upon the counterclaim.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2919.22 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.04. Defendant sought review and contended that the trial court erred in refusing to grant her motion to dismiss because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.22(A) was unconstitutionally vague and overly broad. Pursuant to &sect; 2919.22(A), no person being the parent of a child under the age of 18 was permitted to create a substantial risk to the health or safety of such child by violating a duty of care, protection, or support. The court found that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The court held that the statute was capable of clear understanding to persons within the community. The court determined that, although there would always be degrees of disparity in the care and support of children, the statute only proscribed those actions which posed substantial to children's welfare. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injured child and her parent initiated a personal injury action against the negligent child, the school teacher, and the school board alleging that negligence resulted in the injured child being hurt during chemistry class. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss filed by the negligent child, the school teacher, and the school board. The injured child and her parent sought review and contended that the school board had waived its governmental immunity for such action. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2743.02(A) and (B), the state waived its immunity from liability and consented to be sued. However, the court determined that, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2741.01, &quot;state&quot; meant the state, its departments, boards, and agencies. The court found that the definition of state had not included political subdivisions, which were defined as municipal corporations, counties, and school districts. The court held that the school board retained its governmental immunity and further determined that it had not waived such immunity in the present action. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1972, the property owner, pursuant to an order issued by the city, filled and graded an excavated area. In 1974, the city enacted Cincinnati, Ohio, Mun. Code &sect; 737, regulating the excavation, filling, and grading of land. In 1975 the property owner received a letter ordering her, pursuant to Cincinnati, Ohio, Mun. Code &sect; 737-7, to correct a hazardous condition on her property caused by the slide and movement of earth. The property owner claimed that she could not constitutionally be he liable under the ordinance for the correction of a present condition in existence after the passage of the ordinance. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment in favor of the city. The court stated that the ordinance applied to the property owner not to penalize her for past activity but rather to regulate a present situation. The property owner was subjected to a penalty not because of the manner in which she excavated and filled her property prior to the enactment of the ordinance, but because after that time the property was determined to constitute a hazardous condition in need of correction. Thus, the ordinance was not an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the dismissals. The corporation took pictures of plaintiffs as they distributed leaflets near the corporation's plant and other places in the area. The corporation did not appropriate or exploit plaintiffs' personalities, publicize their private affairs, or intrude into their private activities. By engaging in public political activity, plaintiffs broke the perimeter of privacy that shrouded their private life. The court also found that plaintiffs failed to allege that the corporation had any agreement constituting a conspiracy with the officers of the union. Further, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to entertain cases or causes brought pursuant to a claimed violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1975 because the violation of that statute was a federal cause of action..</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant condominium developer challenged the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Summit County (Ohio), which found on behalf of appellee condominium association in the developer's action for breach of contract and additional tort claims. The issues were whether it was error to grant the associations' motions for summary judgment as to each count, even when the trial court deferred ruling on some counts until after the trial was completed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The developer's condominium development failed. In a legal atmosphere that included multiple accusations of faulty construction, breach of contract, and foreclosures by the lender, the developer filed a nine-count complaint in tort and contract against the homeowner's association. These counts included breach of contract, conspiracy, defamation, malicious interference with contract, and &quot;prima facie tort.&quot; All counts were dismissed by summary judgment, although the trial court &quot;held in abeyance&quot; its ruling on some counts until after the trial on the merits. On appeal, the court overruled all alleged claims of error because as to each count the developer failed to either state or prove a case. The court held that &quot;prima facie&quot; tort was not recognized under Ohio law; that the pleadings failed to plead sufficiently specific acts, locations, and times of the alleged tortious conduct and thus dismissal was appropriate under Ohio R. Civ. P. 9(F); and that it was not an error to rule on the motion for summary judgment after the trial because it then essentially became a ruling on a motion for directed verdict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a decision from the Court of Common Pleas of Belmont County (Ohio), which entered a jury verdict convicting him of carrying a concealed weapon pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12(A). He argued that the evidence was insufficient, that double jeopardy barred a retrial after the first jury had deadlocked, that he was denied a speedy trial, that venue was not proved, and that proposed instructions should have been used.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During a traffic stop, police discovered a sawed-off shotgun hidden in the sleeve of a jacket on the back seat of defendant's car. In his first trial for violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12(A), the jury deadlocked. After a second trial, defendant was convicted. On appeal, he urged that the evidence did not support the verdict, because the weapon was not &quot;ready to hand&quot; or capable of being fired immediately. The court explained that whether the weapon was ready to hand was a jury question and whether it could be fired immediately was not dispositive. Defendant argued that double jeopardy barred his second trial. Because the court of common pleas had set forth the reason for the jury's discharge under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2645.36, and because deadlock was a legitimate reason to do so, the discharge had not prejudiced the State's second prosecution. Similarly, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.72(H), a hung jury created a &quot;reasonable continuance&quot; for purposes of a speedy trial. The court noted that venue did not have to be proved when the lower court could take judicial notice of its location. Finally, there was no evidence to support defendant's proposed instructions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the conviction of defendant for violation of the state statute barring the carrying of a concealed weapon.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the mother's right to privacy was subordinate to the inquiry of her fitness as the custodian of her child. Her behavior was relevant to determining the best interest of the child. The mother also contended that the trial court's judgment was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3109.04(B), a prior custodian should be retained unless the child's present environment endangered his physical or mental health or development.

The trial court dismissed the appeal because it was brought in the wrong county pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.519. On further review, the widow argued that the trial court should have transferred the action to the proper venue pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 3(C)(1). She also argued Ohio Rev.

In addition, the widow contended that the filing requirements of &sect; 4123.519 were directory, not mandatory. The court affirmed the dismissal because Ohio R. Civ. P. 3 was inapplicable, Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested for the felony offense of illegal procurement of narcotic drugs, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.17. While awaiting the disposition on the felony charge, he was found guilty of loitering, for which he was given a suspended sentence. Thereafter, he was convicted of violating &sect; 3719.17 and sentenced. After his release from the penitentiary, the loitering ordinance, under which he had been convicted, was declared invalid. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.31, defendant filed a motion for expungement of his criminal record. The trial court overruled that motion on the grounds that defendant was not a first offender. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings. According to the court, defendant was a first offender within the meaning of &sect; 2953.31. The court noted that it was unclear whether the word &quot;offense&quot; in &sect; 2953.31 contemplated a conviction under a statute or ordinance later held unconstitutional. Construing the expungement statute liberally, the court concluded that defendant was a first offender within the meaning of &sect; 2953.31, because his misdemeanor conviction was void.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A) and planning or aiding in planning with two others, and committing an overt act in furtherance of a conspiracy, a violation of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant testified and admitted to the narcotics transactions but by way of defense stated that he was an informant. On appeal defendant first argued that the trial court erred when it refused to charge the jury that an innocent reason negated the existence of knowledge. The court held that there was no credible evidence of an innocent reason and the trial court's jury charge was a comprehensive charge. Defendant next asserted that the trial court erred in allowing a taped conversation to be played to the jury. The tapes played to the jury contained oral evidence of defendant's guilt and were relevant. Defendant further contended that the trial court erred when it failed to dismiss a count of the indictment but the court disagreed and decided that the evidence was sufficient to have submitted the case to the jury. The court also held that the trial court did not err when it overruled defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to bring defendant to trial within the statutory and constitutional period. The court concluded that the statute of limitations had tolled. Finally, the court held that the incarceration penalty was not unconstitutional and the verdict was proper.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, the department was granted temporary custody as to all eight children. The department then filed a motion for permanent custody of the four youngest children. Subsequently, the court found that no adequate service of summons had been obtained upon the natural father, therefore, it vacated the order of permanent custody and remanded the case. Upon remand, the trial court again ordered that the four youngest children be committed to the permanent custody of the department. On appeal, the court found that it was apparent from the record that the natural mother was given considerable time in which to correct her bad habits and mode of living so as to justify a return of the children. Therefore, the court held the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it granted permanent custody of the children to the department.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court reversed defendant's conviction after determining that there was insufficient explanatory material before the trial court when the search warrant was issued. The court also determined that the search warrant failed to state with sufficient particularity the things to be seized. Having found that the primary basis for the conviction was improperly seized, the court reversed defendant's conviction and overruled the remaining five assignments of error as moot. In its motion for reconsideration, the city claimed that the pandering charge was not moot because there was other evidence in the record to support the pandering charge. Thus, the court addressed the issue of whether the city code under which defendant was charged comported with the constitutional mandates surrounding obscenity. The court held that sexual excitement and nudity were obscene under constitutional standards, if properly limited to the lewd exhibition of genitals. Accordingly, the court found that the trial court properly construed the ordinance in a manner more sufficiently narrow to bring it within constitutional limits.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2921.33 and disorderly conduct as defined in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with ordinance violations that proscribed resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. The trial court convicted him on both charges and defendant sought review of the trial court's decision. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, finding that pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 30, defendant waived his objections to the trial court's jury instruction as to resisting arrest and refusal to instruct the jury as to the limited purpose for which evidence was admitted pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.59. The court also ruled that defendant failed to preserve for appellate review his claim that the disorderly conduct ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court held further that the makeup of the jury panel did not deprive defendant of his right to due process because he did not allege that any group was systematically excluded from the panel or that the jury selection process was defective. The court found that testimony of police officers as to their previous contacts with defendant were admissible for purposes of showing his reckless disregard of consequences and because the trial court properly limited the line of questioning.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 3170.07(A) for more than one year before the filing of the adoption complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother argued that the New York court assumed jurisdiction over the child when it placed permanent custody of the child with his maternal grandparents and that it had continuing jurisdiction for the adoption. The grandparents had custody of the child since he was five-years-old. The mother did not give the child any gifts or other financial support and lived with her other children. On appeal, the court affirmed. It construed all the relevant statutes in pari materia and found that the New York court had given the grandparents permanent custody, that the child's jurisdiction followed that of its legal guardians, and that when the grandparents moved the trial court had jurisdiction over the adoption. The referee properly determined that the mother's lack of communication and support were without justifiable cause and that a blood relative was allowed to obtain a placement order for an adoption under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5103.16 without the mother's consent. The grandparents had the burden of proving inactivity on the parent's part and there was a sufficient showing that the mother lacked justifiable cause for her actions for one year before the adoption petition filing.</SPAN></P>

The contract provided that the county would not cause or permit chloride discharge from the treatment plant in excess of certain agreed quantities. In the event that the chloride content rose in excess of the agreed amount, certain members of the trust group were granted the right to recover from the board of county commissioners both actual and consequential damages resulting from the breach of the purchase agreement. The landowner argued that as a riparian downstream owner of property and as a taxpayer of the county he would be required to shoulder the burden of paying damages if the board of county commissioners was held liable. The court affirmed the dismissal of the action because the landowner was seeking a declaratory judgment with respect to hypothetical facts. There was no judicial controversy before the trial court to justify it issuing a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>

Neither defendant nor co-defendant were registered to sell securities in Ohio, nor was the corporation registered under the law of Ohio or any other state. After being arrested defendant was searched and numerous checks and agreement forms were found in his briefcase. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court found, inter alia, that defendant was required under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1707.45 to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the sale of the interests in his corporation were exempt transactions under the Ohio Securities Act, which he failed to do. Also, for the protection of the arresting officer from physical injury and claims of loss of valuable property, an inventory of the articles immediately within reach of defendant, as an arrestee, was properly made upon his arrest.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of rape and kidnapping. On review, the court affirmed, finding that the prosecutor's closing remarks were not improper because they were a proper response to defendant's attack on the credibility of the witnesses, and the prosecutor properly asked the jury to consider the witnesses' youthful age when weighing their testimony on the merits. The testimony of the victim's mother was admissible as an exception to hearsay because it was centered upon the time immediately following the alleged rape of the victim, while she was still crying and suffering emotional distress. The victim's inability to recall the utterance went to its weight, not admissibility. The instructions did not unconstitutionally shift the burden of proof to defendant. The victim's sworn statement to the police shortly after the incident was admissible because defense counsel first referred to the transcript and read a portion of when trying to impeach the witness on cross-examination. The State's evidence sufficiently supported the verdict because all elements of the offenses were met, and the evidence showed that defendant was guilty of a separate acts of rape and kidnapping.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance purported to rescind a prior ordinance granting conditional zoning in certain areas of development to plaintiff developer's predecessor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants argued that the developer's action was one for declaratory judgment and that the trial court's jurisdiction over such an action was never properly invoked. On appeal, the court agreed and reversed. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.12 provided that in a declaratory judgment action attacking the constitutionality of a municipal ordinance, the attorney general had to be served with a copy of the proceeding and heard on the matter. Precedent interpreting &sect; 2721.12 established that service on the attorney general was a jurisdictional prerequisite and that failure to comply therewith was fatal to such a complaint. The court noted that the developer's complaint clearly prayed for a declaratory judgment rendering the later ordinance unconstitutional. Moreover, the record established that the developer failed to serve the attorney general with a copy of the complaint. Consequently, the court held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear and consider the matter and its judgment invalidating the ordinance was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested and charged with various offenses after an early morning altercation in which police officers observed defendant screaming obscenities and chasing a woman on the street while threatening to kill her. Defendant was found guilty by a jury of resisting arrest in violation of a city ordinance that was identical to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.33. After the trial court (Ohio) entered judgment on the verdict, he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because police efforts to arrest defendant were grounded in their belief that he had violated a city ordinance prohibiting disorderly conduct, defendant claimed on appeal that the underlying ordinance was facially void, that his resistance to the arrest therefore was justified, and that he could not be convicted of violating &sect; 2921.33 in connection therewith. The court rejected defendant's claims and affirmed his conviction. Adopting language from the syllabus of a recent ruling of the Supreme Court of Ohio, the court held that in the absence of excessive or unnecessary force by an arresting officer, a private citizen such as defendant was not permitted to use force to resist arrest by one he knows, or has good reason to believe, is an authorized police officer engaged in the performance of his duties, whether or not the arrest is illegal under the circumstances. In other words, even if a court subsequently declared that the ordinance upon which the police officer relied in making the warrantless arrest was unconstitutional, the right to resist such an arrest no longer exists in Ohio. Defendant's conviction was thereupon affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court convicting defendant on a charge of resisting arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it was too vague and indefinite, because it permitted arbitrary arrest, or because it was unconstitutionally overbroad. The court rejected all three claims and expressly upheld the ordinance's facial constitutionality. Applying the rule that an ordinance is not unconstitutionally vague if a person of ordinary intelligence had fair notice of what conduct is forbidden, the court held that the ordinance clearly identified the conduct that was forbidden thereby: loitering for the purpose of engaging or soliciting another person to engage in sexual activity for hire. Because the language was subject to only one interpretation, and because there were ascertainable guidelines for its enforcement and definitions of its terms, it was neither vague nor indefinite. Nor did it infringe on First Amendment freedoms of association because it carefully targeted loitering for the purpose of creating illegal associations which were not constitutionally protected. After concluding that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally overbroad, the court declined to consider whether a narrowing interpretation would violate defendant's rights.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4123.52.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The worker suffered a back injury in July 1969. He received medical care for more than six years and then, in August 1975, applied for permanent partial disability. While such an award was initially allowed, the Commission later disallowed it based on its holding that any such award was barred by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.52. On the worker's appeal to the common pleas court, he challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 4123.52, claiming that it violated his equal protection rights under both the Ohio and U.S. Constitutions. By granting summary judgment to the Commission, the common pleas court denied relief to the worker. He appealed but the court affirmed. It found that the legislature was entitled to classify employees based on the timing of their receipt of specified disability benefits; and that those classifications did not lead to arbitrary and capricious results and did not violate the worker's equal protection rights. Furthermore, the statute was valid under the &quot;rational basis&quot; test because the statute served the legitimate interest of cutting off stale claims.

The applicant raised numerous challenges on appeal, some alleging constitutional rights violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant sought review of the Board's order denying a permit application to operate an air contaminant source, based upon the Ohio EPA's finding that the proposed use would violate the applicable emission standards. The applicant raised 15 issues on appeal, alleging specific errors allegedly committed in violation of the applicant's constitutional and statutory rights. The court on appeal affirmed the Board's decision denying the permit based on its determination that the applicant failed to provide much of the information required in the initial permit application pursuant to Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 3745-35-05(F), despite the fact that the applicant sought an exemption rather than a variance to operate an air contaminate source. The court held that it would treat the applicant's &quot;defective&quot; application as if had never been filed. The court overruled all of the applicant's assignments of error, holding that no constitutional or deprivation of rights questions had been properly raised.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The passenger commenced the instant action to recover for injuries he sustained in an accident while riding in a car owned and operated by the driver. The driver admitted liability and the cause was sent to the jury, over the objection of the passenger's counsel, on the issues of assumption of the risk and damages. The jury found that the passenger had assumed the risk and returned a verdict for the driver. On appeal, the court disagreed with the passenger's contention that there was insufficient evidence to raise the issue of assumption of risk. The record indicated that the passenger had accompanied the driver to four locations and that alcohol was consumed by the driver at each stop. Although that evidence by and of itself did not compel a finding that the passenger assumed the risk, the trial court properly determined that an issue of fact was posed as to whether or not the passenger assumed the risk when he voluntarily became a passenger in the driver's car. The court also found that the common law defense of assumption of the risk was not abrogated by the Ohio Supreme Court opinion declaring the guest statute, former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4515.02, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which in accordance with jury verdicts, entered a judgment that convicted and sentenced defendant for felonious sexual penetration in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.12(A)(1), kidnapping in violation of &sect; 2905.01(A)(4), rape in violation of &sect; 2907.02(A)(1), (3), and attempted aggravated murder in violation of &sect;&sect; 2903.01(B) and 2923.02(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant allegedly transported the victim to a secluded area where he raped her repeatedly, slit her throat, and left her for dead. A jury found defendant guilty as charged. Defendant sought review. Rejecting each and every one of defendant's assignments of error, the court specifically held that defendant's conviction for both rape and kidnapping was not barred by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.25 because his conduct constituted two or more offenses of dissimilar import. The evidence showed that defendant took his victim at gunpoint from the vicinity of her home and removed her forcibly to a lonely rural spot for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity. Such evidence could not be construed as a single act that could be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import. Moreover, the Double Jeopardy Clause did not bar defendant's convictions for both kidnapping and rape because each penal statute required proof of a fact that the other did not. In addition, the court held that the pretrial photographic identification of defendant was not so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested in possession of a handgun that had been properly registered under the ordinance to someone else.

Defendant further contented that one could believe that possession of a previously registered handgun was legal. The court read the ordinance in its entirety, and the ordinance clearly required registration of both the possessor and the handgun. The possessor was required to obtain the identification card before possession of the handgun was legal. The ordinance was entitled to a presumption of constitutionality. A three-day jail sentence and $ 250 fine provided for by the ordinance were not cruel and unusual punishment because they were not extraordinary or shocking to any reasonable man.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A witness saw defendant shoot and kill the victim. The witness, a 17-year-old with impaired learning ability due to brain damage sustained in an accident that occurred when he was a small child, provided a coherent and detailed account of the events leading up to the fatal shooting. Essentially, the witness testified that defendant laid in wait for the victim. Defendant testified that he shot the victim in self-defense. The jury found defendant guilty as charged. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that the killing of the victim was deliberate and premeditated. Moreover, the State's two isolated, unanswered references to defendant's post-arrest silence did not require reversal because the comments were not extensive, an inference of guilt was not stressed to the jury, and there was sufficient evidence to support an acquittal only if the jury believed that defendant shot the victim in self-defense. Taking these three factors into account, and recognizing that objections to the offending questions were sustained, the court held that the questions did not have a prejudicially harmful effect on defendant's rights.</SPAN></P>

Defendant raised six allegations of error by the trial court on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted on 13 counts of kidnapping in violation of Ohio Rev.

Defendant was convicted by a jury of all the charges. Defendant had, while in possession of a shotgun and a handgun, taken control of the offices of a corporation in an attempt to obtain certain concessions from corporate management. Defendant alleged on appeal, inter alia, that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offenses of the crimes of extortion and possession of criminal tools. Defendant claimed that the trial court should have instructed the jury on coercion as a lesser included offense of extortion, and unlawful possession of a dangerous ordnance as a lesser included offense of possession of criminal tools.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As police arrested defendant outside the courthouse, he stated that he was attempting to steal car titles from the building. He was convicted of the theft charge and the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the offense he violated, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.13(A), did not rely upon an impermissibly vague definition of &quot;theft offense&quot; contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.01(K). The provisions were specific and understandable and not so overbroad or indefinite as to violate due process. The court then held that the county court did not err when it denied the motion to suppress admissions made before defendant was advised of his Miranda rights. Although defendant was in custody at the time, he was not under interrogation. The statement was spontaneous and voluntary. The court also found that the county court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded evidence of defendant's prior alcohol-related offenses. They were irrelevant to defendant's intent to commit the theft offense. Finally, the motion for a judgment of acquittal properly was denied because his statement was sufficient evidence of defendant's intent to take car titles when he entered the courthouse.</SPAN></P>

The court denied leave to appeal. The court noted that the Ohio Supreme Court had held that the question was proper under the circumstances. The court held that &sect; 2945.67 was unconstitutional and void to the extent that it attempted to enlarge the jurisdiction of the court of appeals beyond the constitutional limits. The court determined, therefore, that it was unable to review the order. The court noted that the service of the motion for leave to appeal on the trial judge was unnecessary, but that it should have been served on defendant, although by filing responding memorandum, defendant waived service.

The statute provided for alternative dispositions by the juvenile court once it determined that a child was either neglected, abused, or dependent. The parents had no constitutional right to liberty as protected by the Due Process Clause not to testify at the trial. The parents had a right to remain silent to avoid self incrimination. Refusal to testify on the grounds of self incrimination had to be voiced by the witness. Although the parents might have been fit to resume the duties of parenthood, the question of the parents' suitability or fitness was inexorably intertwined with the child's best interest. The juvenile court had to address the question of the ability of the natural parent to cope with the child where a separation necessarily had resulted in the child becoming a stranger to the natural parent.</SPAN></P>

The property owner appealed to the board, which upheld the other agency's action, then to the trial court, which dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The property owner appealed and the court reversed and remanded. On remand, the trial court remanded the case to the board for a hearing on the property owner's challenges to the ordinances. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the notice provisions of the Ohio Administrative Procedure Act did not apply since the board was not an agency listed in the Act and that the board was not required by constitutional due process principals to provide notice of its original order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant City of Cleveland, Ohio, appealed from the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga County (Ohio), that found in favor of plaintiff property owner in the action for injunctive, declaratory, and compensatory relief. The common pleas court held that the property owner was not required to pay for water used to clean its building under Cleveland, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 535.03 (Nov. 20, 1974).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner asserted that its building fell within the definition of &quot;public market house,&quot; for purposes of Codified Ordinance &sect; 535.03. The common pleas court agreed and enjoined the City from charging the property owner for water used to clean the premises. The property owner also was awarded monetary damages. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment, finding that the common pleas court misconstrued the language of the ordinance. The building clearly was a public market. However, the court found that the building did not constitute a &quot;market house,&quot; as the term was used in the ordinance. The phrase &quot;market house,&quot; though ambiguous, was intended to be interpreted in its traditional sense. Because the building was not owned by the City, designated by the City as a market, or subjected to City regulations concerning &quot;markets,&quot; it was not within the definition of &quot;market house,&quot; as the term was used in the ordinance. The court held that the City and the State, through enactment of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 743.09, intended only those markets municipally owned or designated to receive free water for cleaning purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the injunction and reversed the portion of the judgment granting money damages to the property owner. The court entered judgment for the City and ordered that a special mandate be sent to the common pleas court to carry the judgment into execution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant City of South Euclid, Ohio, challenged the judgment of the common pleas court (Ohio) that found in favor of appellee firefighters union in the action involving the retroactive application of City of South Euclid, Ohio, Ordinance 44-B, &sect;&sect; 137.05, 137.08, which prescribed the maximum number of accumulated sick leave hours permitted and established incentives to preserve sick leave credits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The City passed the ordinance, capping accumulated sick leave for employees as 960 hours each year and providing bonuses for employees whose accumulated leave exceeded that number. Before the enactment of the ordinance, the firefighters were statutorily entitled to accumulate 2,160 hours of sick leave. After the firefighters brought the action for declaratory and injunctive relief, the common pleas court found in their favor and held that the retroactive provisions of the ordinance were invalid. The firefighters subsequently claimed that the bonuses were applicable to firefighters with more than 960 hours of accumulated sick leave. The common pleas court again ruled in favor of the firefighters. On appeal, the court reversed the portion of the judgment that awarded bonus money to firefighters who had accumulated sick leave exceeding 960 hours but less than 2,160 hours. The bonus was applicable to firefighters with more than 2,160 sick hours when the ordinance was enacted. The court affirmed the remainder of the judgment, and held that the common pleas court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the award of attorney fees to the firefighters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the portion of the judgment that awarded bonus money to firefighters who exceeded the revised accumulated sick leave maximum.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which denied his petition for post conviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted on four counts of armed robbery on February 1, 1972. Defendant subsequently pleaded guilty to one count of armed robbery and was sentenced to 10 to 25 years, the maximum under the statute at the time. The state criminal code was revised effective January 1, 1974, and amended the penalty for the comparable offense to armed robbery to a minimum of four, five, six, or seven to a maximum of 25 years. Defendant filed a petition in April of 1977 for post-conviction relief to modify his sentence to reflect the current statute, which was denied by the trial court. Affirming, the court held that defendant did not have a statutory right to a reduced sentence because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.61 provided that persons charged with a non-capital offense prior to January 1, 1974, were to have been prosecuted under the law as it existed at the time the offense was committed. The court determined that amendments to the criminal code were prospective in application, were not per se unconstitutional, and did not affect a previously imposed sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city contended that the trial court erred in finding that the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to the property owners' land. The property owners argued that a limitation of the use of their property to a multi-family use was not economically feasible and that the zoning ordinance did not promote the public health, safety, or welfare, and therefore constituted a taking of their property without due process within the contemplation of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The court overturned the trial court's ruling, holding that the question of whether the ordinance had a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, or general welfare was fairly debatable. The court further stated that the fact that the property was more value for purposes other than the purpose for which it was zones, alone, did not void the zoning restriction.</SPAN></P>

The admission of the bullets found in defendant's automobile was correct for they tended to show that he had access to or ownership of weapons and proved the identity of the assailant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery and murder and was sentenced to a juvenile reformatory. Defendant was subsequently transferred from the reformatory to an adult penitentiary because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5143.03 prohibited those convicted of murder to be sentenced to a reformatory. Defendant attempted to vacate his convictions because he claimed that his guilty pleas were given in exchange for the promise that his time would be served in the reformatory.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.67 et seq., the State appealed by leave of the court an order of an Allen County trial court (Ohio), which, upon defendant's motion, directed the State to elect prior to trial one count from the eight counts of the indictment upon which it would proceed. Defendant was indicted on four counts of drug trafficking under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(6) and four counts of drug trafficking under &sect; 2925.03(A)(7).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court ordered the State to elect just one count on which to proceed against defendant. The State sought leave to appeal under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.67 et seq., which the court granted. However, the court revoked its prior leave and dismissed the appeal, finding that the leave had been improvidently and prematurely granted. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.70 provided that leave to appeal could have been granted to a prosecutor in a criminal trial only where the judgment of the trial court decided a motion to quash, a plea in abatement, a demurrer, a motion to suppress evidence, a motion in arrest of judgment, or the equivalent thereof. However, the trial court's order to elect fell squarely into none of those categories. It was not an equivalent of motion to quash, as some part of the original charge would necessarily have been left pending, nor was it equivalent to a dismissal because defendant still had to stand trial. Therefore, there was no judgment terminating the action and no final appealable order. Further, the motion did not initiate a special proceeding in which an interlocutory appeal could be taken from an order affecting substantial rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court revoked its prior leave to appeal and dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the decision from the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which convicted defendant of aggravated burglary and grand theft. Defendant challenged a conviction for aggravated burglary under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.11(A)(3) when simple burglary under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.12 covered the same acts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and some friends were drinking at a man's house. Defendant burglarized the home when the man left to pick up his wife. Defendant contended that because of the interplay between the two statutes, his due process and equal protection rights were violated. He further contended that he could have been charged with just burglary and that it was improper to charge him with the harsher statute. On appeal, the court disagreed. The court set out the differences between the two statutes. In summary, aggravated burglary required the State to prove elements that burglary did not, namely, that the burglary was of an occupied structure which was the permanent or temporary habitation of a person who was present or likely to be present. Further, the &quot;presence&quot; of the person was not absolutely required. As long as there was a possibility that someone was present or might arrive at a given time at their residence was sufficient. Thus, although the victims were gone, their home was obviously their permanent dwelling place were they were likely to be present.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants A and B sought review of a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Stark County (Ohio), in which they were convicted of rape, and complicity charging rape, felonious assault, and felonious sexual penetration. Defendant A was also convicted of felonious sexual penetration as a principal. Defendants were sentenced accordingly, with defendant A's sentences to run consecutively in part and defendant B's sentences to run concurrently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were tried together and convicted. Defendants appealed, and the court affirmed in part, holding that a photo of the victim being held down with a rifle barrel inserted in her vagina while defendants, by aiding and abetting each other, were compelling her to submit by force or threat of force was sufficient to support the jury's finding beyond a reasonable doubt that defendants knowingly caused serious physical harm to the victim. The court determined that the trial court did not err in refusing to charge on the lesser included offense of assault as the same acts which supported defendants' convictions for felonious sexual penetration could have constituted felonious assault and that the admission of defendants' co-conspirators' statements and the trial court's refusal to excuse a certain juror were neither erroneous nor prejudicial. The court found that the admission of the victim's statements from the hospital was proper, unlike the admission of the doctor's testimony as to such statements, which was error, albeit harmless, as were the prosecutor's comments in closing. The court concluded that the evidence was insufficient to sustain defendants' other convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for complicity in the commission of felonious sexual penetration and remanded the cause for the execution of the corresponding sentence on that count as to each defendant. The court vacated defendants' convictions and sentences on all the remaining counts and remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings according to law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff injured party appealed a judgment from the Ohio Court of Claims, which, after finding that the notice provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2743.16A regarding tort claims against governmental entities were constitutional, denied plaintiff's claim against defendant state transportation department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injured party contended that the lower court erred in not finding that the notice provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2743.16(A) for claims against governmental entities violated the equal protection and due process clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2, 16. The injured party sought to have the court, on appeal, reexamine the issue of the statute's constitutionality. Her specific contention was that the statute's notice provision violated the constitutional provisions because it exposed private tortfeasors to a greater risk of liability than governmental tortfeasors, rendered it more difficult for the victims of a governmental tort to recover than the victim of a private tort, and created an improper distinction between tort and other claims. The court dismissed the appeal for lack of merit. Traditionally, distinctions were made as to the length of the statute of limitations determined by the nature of the claim. Further, the statute's notice requirement was not an absolute bar to claims against a governmental entity but instead provided that the action could be brought despite failure to comply with the notice provision if good cause was shown.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner's property adjoined a large public park and was zoned R-5, which permitted the construction of a multi-family building. The landowner planned to construct a high-rise apartment, but nearby property owners objected. The council passed Cincinnati, Ohio, Ordinance No. 259-1977 to create an Interim Development Control (IDC) District as a means to regulate development of the property in issue. The trial court concluded that the ordinance was invalid because it was passed when its previously issued restraining order was imposed against the council. On review, the court determined that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to issue the restraining order. The court ruled that the trial court's basis for declaring the ordinance invalid therefore failed, but nevertheless the grant of a writ of mandamus was proper. The court found that the disputed ordinance was not applicable when the landowner filed a building permit because the ordinance was not approved by the planning commission, as required by Cincinnati, Ohio, Zoning Code &sect; 3302.1. Thus, the writ of mandamus to compel the processing of the permit under previously existing regulations was warranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During trial, defendant attempted to introduce evidence as to the deplorable and unsanitary condition of the jail from which he escaped. The trial court refused this evidence on the ground of irrelevancy. The court determined that the State of Ohio did not recognize any affirmative defense to a charge of breaking jail if the detention was pursuant to judicial order or in a detention facility. In the case of any other detention, irregularity or lack of jurisdiction was an affirmative defense only if either of the following occurred: the escape involved no substantial risk of harm to the person or property of another, or the detaining authority knew or should have known there was no legal basis or authority for the detention. The jail was a detention facility, so an affirmative defense was barred. Thus, the condition of the jail would have been irrelevant. The court affirmed and concluded that the term, &quot;in case of any other detention,&quot; in &sect; 2921.34 was not unconstitutionally vague. There were many cases of detention other than by judicial order or in a detention facility. An effected arrest and placement in a police car or patrol wagon was any other detention.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state supreme court passed a rule providing for the registration of all attorneys in the state and for the biennial payment of a registration fee of $ 50.

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial court did not err in disposing of the action by rendering a judgment on the pleadings because no material issue of fact existed and one party was entitled to a declaration in his favor as a matter of law. The trial court was correct in finding that the association and the attorney failed to show that any of the challenged rules were clearly incompatible with the Ohio Constitution. Further, the trial court was correct in determining that the state supreme court had authority under Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 2(B)(1)(g) to promulgate the rules in question.

His claim was allowed and the medical bills paid. He made no further applications for compensation of any nature until six years later, when he filed an application for a determination of permanent partial disability. The commission disallowed his claim for permanent partial disability as the result of the earlier injury, and the trial court dismissed his appeal. On appeal, the worker claimed that the trial court erred in finding the pertinent provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.52 not to be in violation of the equal protection requirements of the Ohio Constitution and the United States Constitution and in dismissing the action. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.52 compensation six years after an injury was barred unless during that period it was demonstrated that the injury was more than a slight injury requiring immediate medical attention evidenced by application and payment for some type of disability incurred as a result of the injury.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court denied defendant's motions to dismiss a three-count drug related indictment. Defendant entered a no contest plea, and he was found guilty and sentenced. On appeal, defendant contended that an unreasonable delay in the initiation of prosecution denied him due process, that he was denied a speedy trial due to unreasonable delay, and that the first and third counts of the indictment failed to allege offenses against the laws of the State of Ohio. The court affirmed the judgment against defendant. The court found that defendant's constitutional right to due process and to a speedy trial was not violated. Defendant's plea of no contest and his admissions negated his claim of prejudice based upon an inability to remember, and it was not fundamentally unfair to compel him to stand trial. The court determined that a provision in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.43 for the automatic addition, transfer, or removal of substances listed in Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While the owner was hunting raccoons, the dog in question failed to return as usual and disappeared.

A man bought the dog from the shelter and subsequently sold the dog to the purchaser in the instant action for $ 20 and a shotgun. The owner found his dog in the purchaser's kennel and took the dog back with the aid of the county sheriff. The court disagreed that the trial court should have applied Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 955.16 rather than &sect; 955.12 because in previous cases the dogs summarily seized and sold or destroyed by the dog warden without notice to an unknown owner under &sect; 955.16 were considered dangerous, diseased, or a nuisance, while the dog in question, on the contrary, was in good physical condition, was gentle and well-trained, and was recognized by the dog warden and others as a well-bred and valuable dog. The court concluded that the animal shelter's action in selling the dog was a denial of due process to the owner, and applying &sect; 955.16 would have been unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court of claims granted summary judgment to the state.

Wildlife, Dep't Nat. Res. Order, R. 1501:31-3-03.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Chief denied the fishermen's' applications for fishing licenses after determining that the fishermen had been tardy on paying their fees in the previous year so they were to be considered new applicants. On appeal, the court reversed. The court disagreed with the fishermen's' claim that the Chief's order was invalid for failure to give proper notice. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.07 did not require notice where the parties requested the hearing. The court agreed with the fishermen that Rule 1501:31-3-03(B) was unconstitutional in that it was vague. That section referred to new applicants and granted the Chief discretion to issue new licenses without specifying any procedure for equitably granting or denying licenses to new applicants who had met the pre-application qualifications set forth in &sect; 1533.342. Because of the same lack of procedure, the court agreed that the Chief's refusal to grant the fishermen licenses as new licensees was an arbitrary decision. Moreover, the court noted that there was a lack of evidence in the record to indicate that the Chief, in denying the fishermen's' licenses followed the criteria set forth in &sect; 1533.342.</SPAN></P>

The church had used the land and building for almost a hundred years. The trial court quieted title to the church, and the heirs appealed. On review, the court affirmed. The &quot;root of title&quot; was the deed of the original grantors to the church in 1883. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5301.47 provided that the effective date of the root of title was the date on which it was recorded. That deed was the only recorded conveyance or transaction affecting the title to any interest in the premises. The habendum clause of the deed recited that the grantee was to hold the premises forever. The church held an unbroken chain of title of record to a fee simple condition subsequent in the land for forty years or more after 1880 and had a marketable title pursuant to &sect; 5301.48, subject to the provisions of &sect; 5301.49.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mental patient was committed to the hospital after he was found not guilty of two counts of aggravated murder by reason of insanity. The mental patient offered no expert medical evidence as to his sanity; he contended that the burden was on the State to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that he remained insane and; that the legal presumption of continuing insanity contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.39 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court concluded that whether it considered the presumption of continued insanity a rule of substantive law relating only to the basis for the original commitment or whether it considered it as a procedural device applicable to a subsequent habeas corpus hearing the trial court committed error prejudicial to the mental patient in requiring him to &quot;overcome&quot; the presumption. The court reasoned that error constituted cause for reversing the trial court's judgment. However, the court held that it could not enter final judgment for the mental patient because the court did not have the evidence submitted by both parties and it was apparent that each party did submit some evidence having probative value as to the issue before the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The advertiser obtained a permit to erect an outdoor advertising sign on leased property, but the officials notified the advertiser that the sign violated certain zoning ordinances. The officials informed the advertiser that if the sign was not removed, they would take action through civil or criminal court. The advertiser asked the trial court to declare that the zoning ordinances were void and of no effect because they conflicted with state provisions. The trial court dismissed the advertiser's complaint on the basis that the advertiser could raise the defense of invalidity and unconstitutionality if the officials filed an action against him. On appeal, the court found that the trial court erred in dismissing the advertiser's complaint. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.03, the advertiser had a right to file the complaint for declaratory judgment and the existence of another adequate remedy did not preclude a judgment for declaratory relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The daughter argued, inter alia, that the probate court had no authority to establish the value of the real property upon hearing of objections to appraisement, that the value found by the probate court was against the manifest weight of the evidence, and that the probate court erred in awarding a year's allowance under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2117.20 to a widower. The administrator contended that &sect; 2117.20 established a classification based on sex that violated the Equal Protection Clause. The court held that the probate court did not err in determining the value of the real property because an exception by the daughter specifically contended that the appraisement in the inventory was erroneous. The value determined by the probate court was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Section 2117.20 was constitutional because it was designed to further the policy of cushioning the financial impact of spousal loss upon the sex for which that loss imposed a disproportionately heavy burden. The probate court erred in awarding a year's allowance to the surviving widower, there being no statutory authority therefor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with prostitution, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.25. The Hamilton County Municipal Court (Ohio) overruled defendant's motion to dismiss and found defendant guilty on her no-contest plea. Defendant appealed from the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that a prostitute could be convicted under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.25 solely upon the testimony of the customer, whereas a customer who was brought to trial under the complicity statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.03, could not be convicted solely upon the testimony of his accomplice, i.e., the prostitute. At the heart of this argument was the supposition that the customer could only be prosecuted under the complicity statute and not under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.25, the prostitution statute. The court rejected defendant's argument, stating that it had not been shown that the statutory scheme was such that in every case, regardless of the facts, a customer's conviction would require more proof than that which was needed to sustain a conviction of the prostitute. There was simply nothing on the face of &sect; 2907.25 which rendered it inapplicable to the customer perforce. The court declined to hold that &sect; 2907.25 was limited by its terms to offenses committed only by prostitutes and not their customers. Finally, the court noted that defendant had failed to demonstrate that the claimed evidentiary disparity had worked an unconstitutional detriment to her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bicyclist sustained injuries when his bicycle was involved in a collision with an automobile. The driver of the automobile died prior to trial. At trial, the bicyclist stated that he was unable to prove his claim without using his own testimony. The trial court ruled that because the driver was deceased, the bicyclist was barred from testifying concerning the driver's liability by operation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2317.03. Because the bicyclist had no other testimony to offer, a judgment was granted for the administrator. On appeal, the bicyclist argued that &sect; 2317.03 was unconstitutional because it violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2 and 16. The court held that the classification of persons who presented claims against estates and persons who presented claims against competent living persons bore a fair and substantial relation to a legitimate legislative objective and was not violative of equal protection. Section 2317.03 sought to protect estates against invalid or spurious claims. Further, &sect; 2317.03 did not offend due process, as it did not create an irrebutable presumption of perjury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The candidate was successful in his race for the position of county prosecutor.

The candidate contended that &sect; 3599.091(B)(9) was unconstitutional as violative of the First Amendment and in its delegation of legislative and judicial power. The court held that: (1) there was a compelling state interest in promoting honesty in the election of public officers and that &sect; 3599.091(B)(9) was facially constitutional; (2) there was no unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority because &sect; 3599.091(B)(9) merely conferred on the commission the power to make a factual determination as to whether &sect; 3599.091(B)(9) had been violated; (3) &sect; 3599.091(C) did not create an unconstitutional delegation of judicial power because it merely afforded the preliminary step to commencement of prosecution; and (4) the trial court erred in imposing the proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard upon the commission because &sect; 3599.091(C) did not make such a requirement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of conviction and concurrent sentences of death and imprisonment entered by the Court of Common Pleas, Franklin County (Ohio) upon a jury verdict finding defendant guilty of felony murder in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01(B), with a specification of aggravated robbery, and aggravated robbery in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.01.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was not denied complete discovery by the prosecutor's failure to provide a prosecution witness's telephone number. Even if defendant's out-of-court statements were taken in violation of his Miranda rights, they did not add anything to what had already been established by competent, credible, third-party testimony and other evidence at trial. Accordingly, their admission into evidence was harmless error. In the absence of any evidence of procurement or connivance by the State, the trial court was justified in permitting a prosecution witness to testify on rebuttal although she violated the trial court's separation order. The use of the grand jury testimony by the State to refresh its witness's recollection to correct her testimony was proper. The court sustained defendant's claim that Ohio's death penalty statute was unconstitutional. Concluding that the animus for each charged offense was different, and that sufficient evidence supported a jury finding that defendant acted with the requisite animus as to each offense, defendant's separate sentencing did not violate Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.25. The court overruled defendant's remaining assignments of error.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that because the affidavit charged refusal to make a declaration of estimated income tax for a time including the period for which the ordinance required same was retroactive and, therefore, invalid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The challenged ordinance prohibited service terminations between October 15 through April 15 for residential accounts less than 30 days in arrears as of October 15, prohibited a deposit requirement for delinquent accounts, and required that service be restored upon payment of 50 percent of the gross amount due. The court affirmed the determination that the ordinance conflicted with state law and was invalid. The general laws of the state were supreme in the exercise of the police power, regardless of whether the matter was one that might also properly be a subject of municipal legislation. Municipal regulation of public utilities was such a matter. Because the ordinance prohibited service terminations after October 15, while Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4933.12(A) permitted terminations until November 15, the ordinance was in conflict with the statute. In addition, the provisions as to security and resumption of discontinued service were in conflict with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4933.17.</SPAN></P>

The trial court rejected arguments that the statute violated the First Amendment and violated both the Due Process and the Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court rejected a ruling of another panel of the same court and held that the statute was neither in conflict with First Amendment rights to freedom of speech nor was it so vague nor imprecise that it failed Fourteenth Amendment due process standards. The court then conducted an Equal Protection analysis but rejected the &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; standard because the statute did not restrict the exercise of a homosexual's right to freedom of speech or of any other arguably fundamental rights shared by homosexuals as a class. The statute did not discriminate on the basis of sex because it applied to both male and female homosexuals. The court then tested whether it was reasonable, not arbitrary, and rested upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly situated were treated alike. The court held that the statute was unconstitutional because private homosexual conduct had recently been decriminalized, children were protected from homosexual and heterosexual advances by other criminal statutes, and the law did not address offensive heterosexual advances that could lead to violence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, the state board of education and related officials, appealed from a decision of the Court of Common Pleas, Hamilton County (Ohio), which granted declaratory relief to plaintiff class members, parents, students, the city board of education, and related officials, in an action to determine whether the state's statutory scheme for financing public schools violated Ohio Const. art. VI, &sect; 2 or Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of common pleas held that the statutory scheme for financing public schools violated the &quot;thorough and efficient system&quot; clause of Ohio Const. art. VI, &sect; 2 and the equal protection clause of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2. On appeal, the court first distinguished interference in political questions, which was the exclusive power of the legislature, from constitutional review of statutes, which the court was obligated to perform. The class members had standing: the parents and students had a personal interest in the outcome; and the city school board and related officials had a professional interest. Moreover, Ohio allowed public officials to bring actions on issues of public interest even when they were not personally affected. Because the determination of whether the financing scheme at issue was thorough and efficient was a political question, the court of common pleas erred when it held that the scheme violated the state constitution. But Ohio's constitution gave its children a fundamental right to equal educational benefits. Strict scrutiny of the statute showed no compelling state interest for distinguishing how much funding children in different regions should receive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the court of common pleas erred when it determined that the state statutory scheme for financing public schools violated the &quot;thorough and efficient system&quot; clause of Ohio Const. art. VI, &sect; 2. However, the court affirmed that part of the decision of the court of common pleas that found the state's public school financing statute violated the equal protection clause of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The court affirmed the result.</SPAN></P>

The court commuted defendant's death sentence to life imprisonment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of one count of aggravated murder, one count of attempted murder, two counts of kidnapping, and two counts of aggravated robbery. The trial court sentenced defendant to death by electrocution pursuant to the aggravated murder conviction. The trial court sentenced defendant to various terms of imprisonment for the remaining convictions. On appeal, the court found that testimony by the victim of the attempted murder constituted compelling evidence. Thus, there was no merit to defendant's contention that the verdict was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. The court further found that defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court's exclusion of a prospective juror based on her beliefs regarding capital punishment. The record revealed that the trial court had ample cause to remove the prospective juror. Finally, the court found merit to defendant's contention that he was denied the right to fully conduct the mitigation hearing required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2929.03 and 2929.04. The court noted that the United States Supreme Court had ruled that the Ohio death penalty statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs contended that the trial court erred in granting defendants' motion for summary judgment.

The court found no prejudicial error and upheld the trial court's ruling. In so holding, the court found that &sect; 701.02 permitted the city to interpose the defense of sovereign immunity as a full defense to the cause of action against it for the police officer's negligence, as he was engaged in the operation of a motor vehicle while responding to an emergency call. Section 701.02 negated any cause of action against the police officer individually for such negligence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent was killed in a car accident caused by the tortfeasor's negligent conduct. The administrator and the next of kin sought monetary relief for the loss of the decedent's society, comfort, and companionship. The lower court entered judgment in favor of the tortfeasor on certain causes of action, holding that the wrongful death law codified at Ohio Rev.

On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment, concluding that recovery for loss of society was not authorized by &sect; 2125.02 or the common law of Ohio. Thus, there was no error in the order striking the fourth cause of action or in restricting damages to pecuniary losses. Finally, that order did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Wayne County (Ohio), which, after a jury trial, convicted him of two counts of sale of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), a controlled substance, in an amount equal to or exceeding three times the bulk amount, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(7).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of two counts of sale of LSD under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(7) based on evidence of sales he conducted on two different dates. The court affirmed the conviction. Besides being of the same or similar character, the offenses, comprising the sale of the same controlled substance to the same individual at the same location on two occasions separated by one day, constituted parts of a common scheme or plan or, were part of the course of criminal conduct under rule 8(A). Defendant suffered no prejudice from the single trial. Also, based on the facts presented, the jury could have found that both sales involved unit doses of LSD equal to or exceeding three times bulk amount. Furthermore, the trial court did not commit prejudicial error in answering the jury's question of how it should use the fact of who approached who as to the drug transactions by stating that such was not a fact in issue in the case. Defendant was not prejudiced by the answer given by the court to the second question. Under the definition of &quot;sale&quot; in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.01(EE), it was immaterial if the seller approaches the buyer, or vice versa.</SPAN></P>

There was no constitutional right to have the zoning that existed in the area when the landowners acquired their property stay the same. The establishment of group homes had a substantial relation to public health, safety, morals, or general welfare.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, an investment company, appealed its three convictions for violating an order of the Toledo, Ohio, District Board of Health by the Toledo Municipal Court (Ohio). Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3901.24(A)(1), the Board was seeking to enforce Toledo, Ohio, Dist. Bd. of Health Ordinance chs. 40-1-3.3(2), 40-1-3.2(1 and 2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with violating an order of the Board by leaving downspouts broken, by permitting the foundation of a building to be in a state of disrepair, and by permitting a porch to be in a state of disrepair. The actions of defendant were alleged to have violated Toledo, Ohio, Dist. Bd. of Health Ordinance chs. 40-1-3.3(2), 40-1-3.2(1 and 2), and 40-1-3.2(1) respectively. Defendant claimed that the ordinances were unconstitutional because they were arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, and void. Upon appeal, defendant's conviction for permitting a porch to be in a state of disrepair was upheld, and the remaining two convictions were reversed. The court held that defendant had failed overcome the presumption of unconstitutionality with respect to all three charges. However, the court ruled that the city failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of leaving downspouts broken and permitting the foundation of a building to be in a state of disrepair. Thus, those two convictions were reversed. Because there was reliable, probative evidence supporting the conviction for failing to maintain the porch, that conviction was upheld.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction for failing to maintain a porch in good repair was affirmed. However, convictions for failing to maintain downspouts and failing to maintain a building foundation were reversed. Thus, the matter was remanded for resentencing on the conviction for failing to maintain a porch.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a theater, a theater operator, and the owners of the real property upon which the theater was situated, challenged a judgment of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which, in an action brought by appellee prosecuting attorney found a nuisance to exist as a result of the exhibition of obscene films at the theater, ordered the theater closed for one year, and enjoined appellants from exhibiting obscene films at the theater.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee brought an action against appellants pursuant to the Ohio public nuisance statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3767.01 et seq. The trial court declared that 10 films exhibited at the theater were obscene, found that a nuisance existed, ordered the theater closed for one year, and enjoined appellants from exhibiting obscene films at the theater. The trial court provided for release from the order of closure upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The court held that the trial court's finding that the property owners had knowledge of the character or the content of the films introduced into evidence was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The trial court exceeded the bounds of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 3767 by enjoining appellants from exhibiting obscene motion picture films because ch. 3767 did not allow censorship of films prior to a judicial determination of obscenity. The trial court erred in demanding of the property owners that they would not permit exhibition of any and all obscene motion pictures films before releasing the closure order because the trial court could require only an oath that they would not permit exhibition of the 10 films declared obscene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the trial court's judgment to the extent that appellants were permanently enjoined from exhibiting only the 10 films declared to be obscene by the trial court.

Otherwise, the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver collided with the injured party's stopped vehicle.

In reversing, the court determined that punitive damages were recoverable for acts punishable as crimes or for tort actions involving fraud, insult, or malice. Because the driver admitted his negligence, the only question for the jury was damages. Punitive damages were available because the injured party alleged that his damages were caused by the driver's intentional, reckless, wanton, wilful, or gross acts. Finally, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.16 only barred the introduction of the driver's conviction if he pled not guilty in criminal court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's decision, which limited the injured party's damages to compensatory damages only. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty of aggravated robbery and aggravated murder with the specification based on evidence that he killed a store clerk during an unsuccessful robbery of the store with an accomplice. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's claim that he was entitled to a list of grand jury witnesses, determining that defendant failed to show a particularized need for the grand jury evidence and the grand jury could indict defendant on evidence from his co-defendant's indictment. The court held that defendant was allowed sufficient latitude in the voir dire. The court further held that the conduct of defendant's counsel was an appropriate topic for the State to mention during arguments. The court further held that defendant was not entitled to a voluntary manslaughter instruction based on the evidence. Finally, noting that the Ohio death penalty statute was declared to be unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court, the court did not address defendant's argument that the trial court did not consider mitigating evidence when it assessed his punishment of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

The board had denied the landowners' request for continuing existing and non-conforming use permits, and the landowners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners claimed that they were using their property for commercial purposes prior to the adoption of the zoning resolution and enjoyed a &quot;non-conforming use&quot; right to continue to so use the property. The court held that, given the nature of the allegations in the complaint and the failure of the landowners to timely prosecute an appeal from the board's action, the trial court was without jurisdiction to hear the matter. The court determined that the raising of chickens in the second building on the property was an agricultural use, which did not create a non-conforming use, and that the first commercial use of that building for the processing of chickens, contrary to the zoning plan and first initiated after the adoption of the zoning resolution, did not create a non-conforming use. The court found that the trial court's finding that the second building was used as a commercial building prior to the adoption of the zoning resolution was not supported by the evidence, and its order permitting the second building to be used for bingo and parking was contrary to law. The court concluded however that the record supported a commercial non-conforming use of the first building.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee suffered an injury in the course of his employment, filed a medical-only claim, and was granted the right to participate in the State Industrial Fund. He filed applications for determination of the percentage of increase in permanent partial disability and for lump sum settlement. The Administrator dismissed the applications on the grounds that no compensation had been paid in the employee's claim and that the six-year statute of limitations had run. The employee appealed. The trial court overruled the Administrator's summary judgment motion, but then vacated its judgment and granted the Administrator summary judgment. The employee argued that &sect; 4123.52 violated the equal protection requirements of the Ohio and United States Constitutions because it provided for a shorter period of medical payments in the absence of disability. The court concluded that it was not unreasonable to bar claims for disability resulting from an industrial injury unless disability resulting from the injury manifested itself within six years after the injury. There was no invidious discrimination in the creation of two classes and treating them differently for statute of limitations purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The trial court's decision with respect to the provisions of &sect; 4906.06 that dealt with the environmental impact of a planned utility project was reversed. The court found that the effect of the city's plans to construct a power plant could have had substantial impact outside city limits. Accordingly, the Commission had police power authority to regulate the city utility project to the extent its effect was felt outside the city. The trial court's decision with respect to the unconstitutionality of the provisions of Ohio Rev.

The court affirmed the conviction, overruling each assignment of error. Among the issues raised was whether the trial court erred by allowing the prosecutor to introduce testimony from a witness, the clerk of a municipal court, that referred to a charge of insufficient funds checks over the objection of defense counsel. The court overruled the assignment of error for two reasons. First, the subject matter was first broached by defendant on cross-examination and the failure to object by defense counsel on cross-examination amounted to a waiver of any conceivable error. Second, the evidence was admissible as an exception to the general rule of exclusion because it was material and relevant to the issues invoked by the indictments. It bore directly upon defendant's inducement to and purpose in acting as the State said he did. It supplied a motive and made a connection between defendant, the victims, and their murder. As it was clear that the evidence had no bearing on anything other than motive, defendant was not prejudiced by its admission.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4141.26, the statute in the instant case, was not similar because it enumerated further jurisdictional requisites beyond the filing of a timely notice. The court disagreed with the bank's characterization of its decision as imposing undefined requirements, stating that the bank's notice did not fully describe either the substance or the effect of the decision appealed from, but merely pointed out the bare-bones conclusion of the Bureau and claimed it was error. The court opined that such a notice fell so far short of the statutory requirements that it was substantially and unquestionably insufficient. The court held that its decision did not impose new standards without guidelines, concluding that its inadvertent error in quoting from the notice in the trial court record rather than from the stipulated notice was not sufficient grounds for reconsideration because the notices were substantially alike.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the bank's motion for reconsideration and affirmed its previous judgment, which had sustained the Bureau's first two assignments of error, finding that the bank's notice of appeal to the trial court was not in compliance with statutory requirements. The court, having corrected its decision, overruled the bank's motion for correction.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs brought an action for a declaration that the &sect;&sect; 171.47, 171.48 conflicted with the City of Cleveland Charter (Charter) and Ohio Const. art. XVIII. Plaintiffs also requested an injunction against enforcement of the ordinances. The trial court held that &sect;&sect; 171.47, 171.48 conflicted the authority given by the Charter to the City Civil Service Commission and were thus invalid because the power to enact and enforce a residency requirement was vested solely in the Commission under Charter &sect;&sect; 127, 128.

The city and the company entered into a subdivider's agreement with the city and began and completed construction. Prior to the completion of phase two the city enacted a city ordinance which provided that for the payment of permits and which, if applied to the company, required the company to pay $ 56,700 in fees. The company paid, under protest, and brought two actions. The trial court granted the company's request to permanently enjoin the city from enforcing the ordinance as against the company. The court affirmed and held that although the city did not have a duty to notify the company of the pending ordinance and the ordinance was valid on its face, the ordinance could not be applied to the company because the city had entered into an agreement with the company regarding the construction and the imposition of the fees would have been a gross injustice to the company and would have been retroactive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant public school teachers sought review of a decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Stark County (Ohio), which sentenced them for criminal contempt arising out of their violation of a temporary injunction prohibiting blocking school entrances and picketing on school property on school days during school hours.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court issued a temporary injunction prohibiting the teachers from picketing on school property during school hours. After the teachers engaged in immediate and massive disobedience of the order, they were arrested and brought before the trial court, which offered to purge the contempt in exchange for the teachers' promise not to picket schools during school hours in the future. The teachers declined the trial court's offer and were sentenced for contempt based on their violation of the trial court's order and their refusal to state whether would obey the order in the future. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly found the teachers in contempt for violating the order because the temporary injunction was valid, and the trial court had the inherent authority to determine that disobedience of the order was direct criminal contempt. However, the court found that the trial court erred in holding the teachers in contempt for refusing to state whether they would obey the order in the future because the teachers had a legal right to decline to purge themselves of the contempt, and their mere refusal to do so was not per se an independent act of contempt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment insofar as it found the teachers in contempt for violating the trial court's order and reversed the trial court's judgment insofar as it found the teachers in contempt for refusing to state whether they would obey the trial court's order in the future. The court also vacated the teachers' sentences and remanded the case for resentencing based on the first specification of contempt.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the case. The court held that the trial court erred in holding that the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to the landowners' property and when it granted injunctive relief based on the limited admissions of the pleadings. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the zoning requirements were clearly arbitrary and unreasonable, having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare, as applied to the property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant presented 10 errors for the court's review. The court held that the evidence presented at the pre-trial hearing did not tend to support the conclusion that the trial court abused its discretion in overruling a motion for change of venue. The court further held that it could not say that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing admission of character evidence because it was the opinion of the jurors that was crucial in determining whether defendant would receive a fair and impartial trial. The court also held that the trial court did not err in admitting identification testimony. The court concluded that evidence of defendant's prior conviction was not only properly admitted but that its introduction was essential to support the conviction for Grand Theft. Finally, the court held that because there was substantial evidence of probative value which would support a determination of both a reasonable hypothesis of guilt and a reasonable hypothesis of innocence, the trial court properly submitted the case to the jury.

Code Ann. &sect; 4735.021 was unconstitutional to the extent of requiring persons engaged in the business of referring prospective tenants to possible rental units to be licensed real estate brokers, but that if this requirement was removed from the statute, the remaining part would be reasonable and constitutional. The business of selling descriptions of available rental property was not similar to the other recognized activities of a real estate broker enumerated in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4735.01. The court concluded that the evidence supported the trial court's decision that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4735.01 (A)(10) was arbitrary, unreasonable, and unconstitutional as to the business of selling descriptions of available rental property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a jury trial, the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) convicted defendant for two counts of passing bad checks in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.11. Defendant appealed the conviction. He contended that the presumption created in &sect; 2913.11 lessened the State's burden of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the presumption of knowledge based upon the State's proof of the factual circumstances described in &sect; 2913.11(B)(2) deprived him due process of law under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. He asserted that subsection (B) of &sect; 2913.11, which provided that a person who issued or transferred a check or negotiable instrument was presumed to know that it would be dishonored, lessened the State's burden of proof. In affirming the conviction, the court held that the presumption was not unconstitutional because it did not operate to create or shift a burden of proof onto the accused. The court found that the presumption was not mandatory because the State could at its option prove the element of guilty knowledge by direct and circumstantial evidence and ignore the availability of the presumption. Due to the difficulty in proving such guilty knowledge the State could in the alternative prove the underlying facts from which the statutory presumption arose and risk defendant's rebuttal of such presumption of knowledge. The required proof of the additional fact of failure of any liable party to pay or satisfy the liability saved the statute from constitutional defectiveness.</SPAN></P>

The judgment found them in criminal contempt for violating the trial court's temporary injunction, which prohibited them from picketing appellee school board's property, and which also found them in contempt for failing to state whether they would obey the order in the future.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The teachers picketed the school board's property in violation of the trial court's injunction. During a show cause hearing, the trial court offered to forgive the teachers in exchange for a simple promise not to picket schools in the future. The teachers' responses were evasive; none promised to not picket, and all of them pled the Fifth Amendment. The trial court found the teachers guilty of two counts of criminal contempt, one for violating the injunction, and the second for failing to state whether he or she would violate the injunction in the future. On appeal, the teachers argued that the trial court erred in finding them guilty of contempt for failing to decisively indicate whether they would prospectively comply with the injunction. The court affirmed the judgments of contempt for violating the injunction but reversed the contempt judgments for the teachers' failure to state whether they would violate the injunction in the future. The court held that the mere election not to purge oneself of a contempt was not per se an independent act of contempt.</SPAN></P>

The judgment of contempt and sentence against the teachers for refusing to state whether he or she would obey the injunction in the future were reversed. The matter was remanded for resentencing, but only for violating the injunction.</SPAN></P>

On appeal the property owner argued that the trial court erred in finding that the city council's action in enacting the ordinance was not unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, or capricious. The property owner further asserted that the trial court committed prejudicial error by allowing the city council to introduce evidence in addition to that which was contained in the transcript that had been filed. The court held that the new testimony taken was proper because when the property owner chose to found her appeal on the issue of constitutionality then the trial court was allowed to hear additional testimony.

The victim who survived provided a physical description of defendant, but was unable to identify him at trial because of her poor eyesight, which had been severely impaired by the assault. While the man was in their home, he drank a cup of coffee. The next day, a neighbor found the door to the victims' home unlocked and one victim lying in a pool of blood and naked from the waist down. He found the other victim dead with stab wounds. Thereafter, the police matched the fingerprints found on the cup and saucer with defendant's fingerprints that were on file with the police. After the guilty verdict, a mitigation hearing was held, after which the trial court found no factors in mitigation. The court held that the admission of a fingerprint card with defendant's fingerprints, which was used to identify defendant, was proper because it did not provide an inference that defendant had prior criminal involvement.

When the boyfriend moved out, the children were returned to the mother. A referee found that the children were clean, well-adjusted, and apparently well cared for, that they attended school regularly, and that they were not in the immediate presence of any sexual relationship that their mother may have had with her boyfriend. The court held that: (1) the trial court did not abuse its discretion and did not err in amending the affidavit to reflect that the action was one of dependency rather than neglect; (2) there was sufficient evidence to allow the trial court to determine that the children were dependent; and (3) &sect; 2151.04(C) was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad and the mother's right to privacy or her rights within the family were not violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parcel in question was one of the few single-family residential lots in the village adjacent on one side to retail property and on the other side, to a private residence. The current ordinance by referendum prohibited appellees from constructing an office building on the undeveloped parcel. On appeal, the village argued that the trial court erred when, presented with evidence that the property in question could be developed under the existing zoning (although at less profit than the owner's proposed use) it substituted its judgment for the judgment of the duly elected officials and the electorate of the village as to the most appropriate development of the subject parcel, taking into consideration the health, safety, and welfare of the community. The court agreed, reversed the judgment, and remanded the action. In doing so, the court held that because appellees' parcel was not all surrounded by commercial property, nor could the parcel have been used &quot;only commercially,&quot; there was no evidence presented that the parcel was useless as zoned. Accordingly, appellees' evidence failed to overcome the presumptive validity of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant corporate taxpayer challenged a judgment of the trial court (Ohio), which found in favor of appellee city by affirming a ruling of the city's board of tax appeals upholding an assessment of penalties for the taxpayer's non-filing and non-payment of funds which were withheld from the wages of its employees. The taxpayer argued that the city lacked authority to assess the penalty, which was imposed at the rate of 10 percent per month.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer also argued that the amount of the penalty was excessive, confiscatory, and unconstitutional. On appeal, the court disagreed. The record revealed that the employer withheld wages for municipal taxes from its employees but failed to remit those funds to the city. Parma Heights, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 193.42 authorized a 10 percent per month penalty for failure to remit taxes withheld from employees. Contrary to the taxpayer's claim, Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3 granted authority to municipalities to assess penalties for the failure to comply with their tax ordinances. Because the state had not limited that power, municipalities were not required to conform their penalties to those assessed by the state. Moreover, the penalty imposed in the instant case applied only to employers who unlawfully retained tax funds withheld from employees. That conduct bore greater culpability than the failure to file a return or pay taxes not withheld. As such, the court found that the amount of the penalty was proportionate to the offense. Thus, the court rejected the taxpayer's claim that the penalty was excessive and unconstitutional, and the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Approximately 30 minutes later, the officer observed two men enter the car. The officer followed the car until he confirmed that the warrant was still active. He then stopped the car. The driver was only able to produce an application for a duplicate driver's license. The officer observed that someone had tampered with the ignition. The officer placed defendant and the driver under arrest. Defendant was charged with aggravated burglary, grand theft, and receiving stolen property. A jury found defendant guilty of aggravated burglary and grand theft. On appeal, the court found that continuances granted before defendant's trial were reasonable under Ohio law. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. There was insufficient support for defendant's claim that he was denied due process of law because there was no interpreter provided for him. In addition, defendant waived his objections to a prosecutor's comments and rejected defendant's contention that his trial counsel was ineffective.</SPAN></P>

The court found no indication that defendants would have qualified for issuance of the license or that the marijuana possessed by them was to be used for the purposes required for issuance of a license.

The clerk announced her intention to count as valid the signatures of all registered electors of the city in determining the sufficiency of the recall petitions. The mayor filed a complaint alleging that, under Cleveland, Ohio, Charter &sect; 17, only the signatures of those registered electors who actually voted in the last municipal election could have been counted. The trial court entered judgment for appellees. The trial court granted the mayor's motion for an injunction pending appeal and appellees' motion for an expedited appeal. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. Cleveland, Ohio, Charter &sect;&sect; 16 and 17 were deficient standing alone and had to be read together. The language of Cleveland, Ohio, Charter &sect; 16 implied that all registered electors were allowed to participate in the recall process. Moreover, when read together with Cleveland, Ohio, Charter &sect; 17, Cleveland, Ohio, Charter &sect; 16 imposed the qualitative limitation on who was eligible to sign a recall petition, which was all registered electors of the city.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Service was obtained upon the tax commissioner and the state treasurer, but the record reflected no express notice of the complaint given to the attorney general.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant shot a woman eight times while she sat in her car. She was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital. The indictment contained the specification that defendant had previously been convicted of an offense of which the gist was the purposeful killing of another. Defendant entered pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. On appeal, he raised seven assignments of error. The court considered his challenges to the admission of evidence regarding his prior conviction. The court held that a copy of the relevant New Jersey proceedings was properly certified and admissible in accordance with Ohio R. Civ. P. 44(A)(1). The trial court did not commit reversible error when it qualified a New Jersey detective as an expert, permitting him to testify that second-degree murder under the law of New Jersey, which defendant was convicted of, involved a purposeful killing or intent to kill. The trial court's error was not prejudicial to defendant because it was relevant to the sentence-enhancing specification, and defendant was not sentenced to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the driver contended that his good faith request to call his attorney was not a refusal to submit to a chemical test. The court noted that the police officers testified that the driver made three telephone calls and that he did not say that he refused to take the intoxalyzer test because he had not talked to his attorney. The trial judge obviously believed the testimony of the officers that the driver refused to take the intoxalyzer test without stating that his refusal was conditioned upon his calling his attorney. The officer also had no legal obligation to help the driver find his attorney's name in the telephone book. The driver claimed it was error to rule that the trial court had no authority to grant limited driving privileges. The court noted that where a driver's license was suspended for a refusal to take a chemical test, a trial court had no such authority.</SPAN></P>

The common pleas court also denied the request for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">City of Euclid, Ohio, Ordinances &sect; 941.26 (Feb. 19, 1974) barred the City's removal of refuse from apartment buildings. The owners challenged the validity of the ordinance and sought to enjoin the City from complying with the provision. The City repealed the ordinance, and the action, which had been remanded to the common pleas court, was dismissed. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, finding that the common pleas court properly concluded that the matter was rendered moot by repeal of the ordinance. The court ruled that the common pleas court did not commit reversible error when it mistakenly found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the matter. Service of the attorney general was not required because the case was not in the form of a declaratory judgment action. Finally, the court held that the common pleas court erred in denying attorney fees on the ground that a fund was not created. The court denied attorney fees under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 733.61, applicable to taxpayer matters, because the apartment owners' action was not commenced on behalf of the City, as provided under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 733.59, but rather as an individual claim against the City.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment and ordered a special mandate directing the common pleas court to carry the judgment into execution.</SPAN></P>

After a jury trial, defendant was convicted as charged and sentenced accordingly. Defendant appealed. Upon review, the court found no reversible error and affirmed the judgment.

The court found that any damage that might have done to the witness was overcome by his subsequent testimony. The court held that the trial court was correct in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial when the State introduced physical evidence, through its remarks, that was not in the record during final argument because the State's remarks did not prevent the accused from having a fair trial. The court held that defendant waived his constitutional challenges to statutes that prevented his counsel from cross-examining the victim concerning prior sexual contact with defendant.</SPAN></P>

The victim stated that to her knowledge, defendant was never in her home. Defendant was arrested when a search revealed stolen guns in his home. The victim said that one of the stolen guns resembled an object she saw in one of her attacker's hands. On appeal from defendant's convictions for aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary kidnapping, and having weapons while under disability, the court held that: (1) where the victim testified that two men entered her home, threatened her with a gun, and robbed her, and where defendant's fingerprints were found at the scene of the crime, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's aggravated robbery conviction; (2) where prosecutors were unable to prove that defendant actually carried the gun, the trial court erred in convicting him for carrying a weapon while under disability; and (3) evidence that the victim was moved involuntarily under threat of death supported defendant's aggravated kidnapping conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the trial on the issue of liability, the jury found that the officer was negligent and that the driver was not contributorily negligent.

On appeal, the driver urged that &sect; 701.02, which granted immunity from personal liability to police officers while responding to an emergency call, was unconstitutional. In affirming the judgment below, the court found that the Supreme Court of Ohio had previously upheld the constitutionality of the statute in question. Thus, the court, under the doctrine of stare decisis, was required to uphold the trial court's decision finding that the officer was not liable for his negligence under the facts of the case and that he was responding to an emergency call.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that defendant had failed to file in the court a transcript of the proceedings of the trial court. The court held that defendant had failed to demonstrate prejudicial error on the part of the trial court because the burden was on defendant to demonstrate that the words he used were protected by his constitutional right to free speech and that the words he used were not fighting words which by their very utterance tended to incite a violent reaction constituting a breach of the peace. Persons could not be punished for speaking boisterous, rude, or insulting words, even with the intent to annoy another, unless the words by their very utterance inflicted injury or were likely to provoke the average person to an immediate retaliatory breach of the peace.

After the trial court granted the hospital's motion for a directed verdict, the patient appealed. On review, the court found that the statute barring the expert's testimony was not limited to court of claims cases merely because it was included in that portion of the code. Although the statute was enacted after the filing of the case, it was enacted prior to the trial. The court found no error in applying the statute retroactively because it was a remedial rule of court. Finally, the statute did not offend the principles of Ohio Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment and sentence imposed by the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) after defendant had plead guilty to two counts of aggravated burglary, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.11. The trial court had refused defendant's request to be sentenced under the burglary statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.12. Defendant argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.11 violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court initially determined that defendant's constitutional attack upon the statute, under which he was convicted and sentenced, was not barred by his guilty plea. Defendant argued that the aggravated burglary statute,&nbsp;&sect; 2911.11(A)(3), prohibited exactly the same activity as the burglary statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.12, but that the aggravated burglary statute carried a heavier penalty, which was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court concluded that the crimes of aggravated burglary and burglary were not identical because the statutes consisted of different elements and imposed different burdens of proof. The State had a higher burden under aggravated burglary and had to prove the additional element that &quot;a person was present or likely to be present at the time&quot; of the burglary. The aggravated burglary statute did not violate equal protection and it was not void on its face. Defendant's argument that the State was relieved of its duty to prove the additional element in violation of due process was without merit because defendant had plead guilty, thereby relieving the State of any burden of proof, and the statute was never applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment, which convicted and sentenced defendant under the aggravated burglary statute after he plead guilty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which convicted him of one count of aggravated murder, Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2903.01, and seven counts of aggravated robbery, Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2911.01. After the jury found that the killing occurred during the commission of a felony, the trial court sentenced defendant to 7 to 25 years for each aggravated robbery conviction and to death on the aggravated murder conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant served as the getaway driver while three accomplices robbed a store. During the robbery, an undercover police officer entered the store to question employees about a prior robbery. The officer was shot and killed by an accomplice. On appeal, defendant contended that, among other things, his conviction upon the aggravated murder charge and one of the aggravated robbery counts violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. Defendant further argued that imposing the death sentence upon him as an aider and abettor constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. The court held that a count of aggravated robbery was not merged into the count of aggravated murder as a lesser included offense. Although defendant was found guilty of committing the killing during the course of an aggravated robbery, a specification that gave the trial court the power to impose the death sentence, the elements that comprised the felony of aggravated robbery and those that made up a murder offense were not identical. Moreover, they did not arise out of the same act or transaction. The court also found that the imposition of the death penalty did not violate the Eighth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's five year-old child was found by a neighbor in a hallway of a two story, four family building. He was alone, crying, uninjured, but dirty. Police were summoned. Their repeated knocks on the door to defendant's apartment went unanswered. Defendant retrieved the child from the police station about an hour and a half later. The mother testified that she had taken medication, fallen asleep, and had not heard the knocking at her door. Defendant was convicted of child endangerment. On appeal, the court reversed. The court ruled that the evidence fell short of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had violated a duty of care. The court found that the record was devoid of adequate proof of the existence of special circumstances, conditions, or factors giving rise to a substantial risk to the child's safety or welfare by being alone in the common hallway in an occupied, multi-family residence during the early hours of an afternoon.</SPAN></P>

The client claimed the trial court erred in granting the attorney summary judgment because the client timely filed the malpractice action and the statute of limitations for malpractice, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorney and the client terminated their representative relationship on July 12, 1973. On July 8, 1974, the attorney filed suit against the client seeking to recover a fee. The attorney dismissed his action, on July 18, 1974, after the client was served with notice of the action. On April 18, 1975, the client filed a counter claim against the attorney alleging negligent malpractice. The trial court awarded the attorney summary judgment on the client's malpractice claim. The client appealed, claiming that she timely filed her action, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11, because the one year statute of limitations began to run on July 18, 1974 and her action was filed on April 18, 1975. Furthermore, the client claimed, on appeal, that the malpractice statute of limitations, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11, was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court found the client's claim that she timely filed her complaint was meritless. The court found that the client's constitutional claim was not raised at trial and, therefore, it would not be considered on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relator non-profit corporation, which operated a hospital, sought to compel respondent common pleas court judge to remove the medical malpractice case against the corporation from the application of Ohio's Medical Malpractice Act and to submit the case to arbitration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In seeking mandamus relief, the corporation contended that it had no other adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. Moreover, it asserted that the purpose and benefit conferred by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2711.21 was that by providing an impartial evaluation of actions prior to trial, it encouraged settlements, thereby saving litigants from the uncertainties of trial, and the judicial system from the burdens and expense of trial. In granting the requested relief, the court noted that Ohio C.P. Superintendence R. 16 provided that judges were to consider, and could adopt, a plan for mandatory arbitration in civil cases. The court then found that while the Medical Malpractice did not provide for mandatory arbitration, it did allow for arbitration of claims. Thus, the court concluded that the judge had a clear legal duty to submit the matter to arbitration prior to trial, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2711.21(A), and that the corporation had demonstrated that it was entitled to mandamus to that limited extent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder while in the commission of aggravated robbery and aggravated robbery. Defendant sought review and contended that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to suppress the identification evidence. The court held that a conviction based on eyewitness identification at trial was not to be set aside on such ground only if photographic identification procedure was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to the very substantial likelihood or irreparable misidentification. The court found that the trial court, after considering the totality of the circumstances, determined that the witness had made a proper identification of defendant. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.03(D), the scheme for determining whether there were mitigating circumstances required the trial court to appoint experts to conduct a psychiatric examination of defendant. Under Fed. R. Crim.

Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01 and was sentenced to death. Defendant sought review and contended that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he purposely and with prior calculation and design caused the death of the victim. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01, &quot;prior calculation and design&quot; was designed to exclude the concept of an instant's prior deliberation but required defendant to have killed purposefully after devising a plan to kill. The court found that momentary or instantaneous premeditation was not accepted and further held that the State had met its burden in proving that defendant had the requisite premeditation. The court determined that a deadly weapon was any instrument or device capable of inflicting death and designed or especially adapted for use as a weapon. The court held that neither the State nor defendant was required to offer mitigating evidence. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.03 and Ohio Rev.

The court reversed the judgment that was rendered in favor of the deputy clerk. The court noted that the sole issue was whether or not the court clerk could legally require the deputy clerk, a deputy clerk of many years standing, to comply with a residency requirement as a condition of continued employment. It was not disputed that the deputy clerk was not a classified civil service employee, that she was subject to discharge by the appointing authority, and that she had no contractual tenure. The court found that the residency requirement was not a &quot;retroactive law&quot; and was not proscribed by the Constitutions of the State of Ohio or the United States. The deputy clerk did not have tenure, nor was there any contractual right assuring the deputy clerk of continuous employment. Therefore, the deputy clerk had no vested rights. The court also held that the trial court erred in finding that the residency requirement was selectively enforced against the deputy clerk in violation of her constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the decision of the trial court (Ohio), which convicted him of aggravated murder and aggravated robbery and sentenced him to capital punishment and two consecutive sentences. Defendant asserted that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.03 denied him his right to a fair and impartial jury and that the prosecution failed to meet its burden of proof as to the non-suggestiveness of police identification procedures that were used at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder and robbery and sentenced to death. The court affirmed his conviction and sentence. The trial court's failure to tell prospective jurors at voir dire that this matter involved capital punishment had not deprived defendant of his rights as he had not timely objected to this conduct. There was no indication that the picture spread used in defendant's pre-trial photographic identification was unconstitutionally suggestive or that there had been a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. As defendant's counsel failed to call attention to a decision restricting defendant's cross-examination rights, the court declared that this was a tactical decision it could not interfere with. The trial court had not abused its discretion when it refused to allow a new trial for newly discovered evidence under Ohio R. Crim. P. 33(A)(6), because no new evidence had been discovered. Finally, the trial court properly implemented Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(B), when it evaluated possible mitigating circumstances as it weighed all the evidence and found that defendant had not demonstrated duress or mental deficiency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought relief from the trial court's decision. The court affirmed. It found that the trial court's refusal to disclose the presentence investigation report did not violate defendant's constitutional rights. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2947.06, 2951.03 and Ohio R. Crim. P. 32.2(C)(1), the presentence investigation report was confidential and was not required to be furnished to defendant. Also, the sentencing scheme did not violate defendant's constitutional rights. Then, defendant's assertion that his plea bargain was broken was meritless. The statement made by the trial court concerning defendant's assurances to return as ordered from a conditional release and that defendant alleged contained a sentencing promise was made after his plea was offered and accepted. Defendant could not be involved in making promises concerning his sentencing after pleading guilty because defendant no longer possessed the freedom of action necessary to make a promise. Defendant had to obey the trial court's orders. Additionally, defendant confirmed at one point that he understood the statement not to be a promise. The court affirmed the decision convicting and sentencing defendant.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment convicting defendant of trafficking. The court found that the specific language of &sect; 2925.01(E)(8) challenged by defendant was not before the court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The nursing home building was sprinklered. A fire marshal conducted a routine inspection and determined that the sprinkler system was defective because it did not reach the basement and attic area, an entrance vestibule, several closets, and in the duct work over the cooking surfaces in the kitchen. The nursing home argued that there was no legal requirement that sprinkler protection be extended to the areas in question. The trial court agreed and reversed the license revocation. On appeal, the Department argued that &sect; 3721.071 required the installation of a sprinkler system throughout the nursing home, not only in designated patient areas. In reversing the trial court's judgment, the court held that the trial court committed error prejudicial to the Department in finding that its adjudication order was not based on reliable, probative and substantial evidence and was not in accordance with law. The court found that the legislative intent in &sect; 3721.071 was that all areas of nursing homes required sprinkler protections whether such areas were actually being used for the storage of combustibles, were constructed of combustible materials, or were otherwise hazardous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Court of Common Pleas, Mahoning County, Ohio, convicted and sentenced defendant in accordance with jury verdicts that found defendant guilty of aggravated murder, Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant argued that he was deprived of his statutory right to a speedy trial, that he was denied effective assistance of trial counsel, and that the statutory death penalty scheme put an impermissible burden upon an accused in a capital case and had the effect of coercing a guilty plea. Defendant also claimed that the trial court placed an impermissible burden upon defendant of proving the mitigating circumstances by a preponderance of the evidence. The appellate court rejected these contentions. Because the grand jury recommended an investigation of defendant's sanity, the time that elapsed during such investigation was excluded from the statutory speedy trial period and defendant was brought to trial well within the statutory period. Although the general practice in the area was to appoint two attorneys in a capital case, there was no statute or case law requiring that two attorneys be appointed and defendant failed to point out specific instances of incompetence by trial counsel. The Ohio Supreme Court had previously determined that the statutory death penalty scheme was constitutional. The trial court did not place the burden of a preponderance upon defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners wanted to operate snowmobiles on their property that was within 200 feet of a dwelling house occupied by other residents. The owners alleged that the ordinance conflicted with state law because it prohibited the operation of snowmobiles on private property, not just streets, highways, and other public property in the municipality. The owners also claimed that the ordinance was void because it was unreasonable, arbitrary, and unrelated to the public health and safety. The judgment was affirmed. The court reviewed Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4519.48 and found that it expressly authorized municipal ordinances within the reasonable exercise of the police power to regulate the operation of snowmobiles. The court compared the municipality's ordinance regulating snowmobile operation and the state statute regulating snowmobile operation and concluded that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4519.40(B) did not foreclose or preclude the municipality's determination that it was dangerous or unhealthy to operate snowmobiles within 200 feet of a residence. Ohio Rev.

The court held that &sect; 154 was unconstitutional because a proscription based solely on the fact that a structural change was made in the building, without considering the reasonableness of such changes, was unreasonable.

The court held that the trial judge's judgment finding Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.52 constitutional was correct and, therefore overruled the employee's assignment of error. Because the employee had not applied for, nor received total or partial compensation under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.52, the Industrial Commission's jurisdiction ceased six years after the injury date.</SPAN></P>

After adverse administrative decisions, the employee filed suit in the trial court. At the close of all of the evidence, the trial court granted the employer's motion for a directed verdict. The trial court held that, although the employee had presented enough evidence to go to the jury on the question of whether he was an independent contractor or an employee, the employer was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on question of whether it had in service three or more workmen or operatives, thereby making it an employer for the purposes of the Workmen's Compensation Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.01. On appeal by the employee, the court affirmed, holding that: (1) the employee did not present sufficient evidence to establish that reasonable minds could differ as to whether the employer employed three or more regular employees so as to render it amendable to the Act; and (2) there was no reversible error in the trial court's refusal to permit the employee to cross-examine the employer's accountant, and the trial court properly declined to strike the accountant's cross-examination by the employer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction had previously been upheld on direct appeal by an appellate court and the state supreme court. In its conclusions of law, the lower court determined that, upon its examination of the entire trial record, no substantial ground for relief existed and the mandates of the United States Constitution and the Constitution of the State of Ohio were fully complied with at defendant's trial. In his first assignment of error, defendant took issue with the trial court's conclusion that the petition and the record of trial proceedings showed no substantive grounds for relief. The court's conclusion was based upon defendant's petition and the files and record of the trial proceedings that were before the court below and that constituted the record on appeal before the court. Because defendant's petition and the files and records of the case, as composed, did not demonstrate his entitlement to relief, it was concluded that the trial court properly denied the request for a hearing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was working in the racing industry. She applied for unemployment compensation. The administrator determined that the employee was entitled to seasonal benefits. The employee appealed the administrator's decision to the Board of Review on the ground that her benefits should have been computed in accordance with the non-seasonal benefits schedule, since the horse racing industry in Ohio did not qualify as a seasonal industry under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4141.33(A). The referee, acting on behalf of the Board, affirmed the administrator's finding that racing was a seasonal industry. After the employee's application to institute a further appeal before the Board was disallowed, she appealed to the trial court, which found that racing was a non-seasonal industry, and the employee was entitled to have her benefits recomputed based on the racing industry being non-seasonal in nature. The employer appealed, and the court affirmed. The court found that the evidence established that the racing industry operated in excess of 40 weeks per year so it was not seasonable employment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city passed an ordinance that governed the licensing of taxicabs. The cab drivers filed an action against the city and its officers seeking injunctive relief. The city and the officers filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could have been granted. The motion was overruled, and the cab drivers' request was granted. The city and the officers appealed the denial of their motion and the granting of injunctive relief. As to the motion to dismiss, the court held that since it did not appear beyond doubt that the cab drivers could not have proven a set of facts that would have entitled them to relief, the trial court properly overruled the motion. However, with regard to the injunctive relief, the court held that the trial court's decision was improper. The questions raised by the ordinance were fairly debatable, thus the trial court's attempt to substitute its judgment for that of the legislative body was inappropriate. Unless there was a clear and palpable abuse of legislative power, a court did not have the right to consider or pass upon the wisdom of a municipal ordinance. The order, therefore, was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners applied for a certificate of occupancy under the ordinances. The application was denied. The owners sought a declaratory judgment under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.12 as to the constitutionality of the ordinances and to enjoin their enforcement. The trial court found the ordinances to be vague, and indefinite, and that they had been applied arbitrarily. The village claimed that it was error to deny its motion to dismiss the declaratory judgment action, and in finding arbitrary application of the ordinances. The court affirmed. The village failed to raise the issue of compliance with &sect; 2721.12 in the trial court. Because the Attorney General was not served with a copy of the proceedings, challenging the constitutionality of the ordinances, the motion to dismiss was well taken; however, the court did not pass on the merits because it was not raised below. There was ample evidence that the ordinances were arbitrarily and capriciously administered against the owners. Other businesses in the same area had been granted permits, and the application of the ordinance to the owners' property bore no reasonable relationship to the public health, safety, or welfare.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">More than six years had passed since the Commission awarded medical benefits to the claimant. The Commission concluded that it no longer had jurisdiction under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.52 (amended 1967) to further consider the claimant's application for permanent partial disability benefits as the claimant had not been receiving total disability compensation and its jurisdiction continued only for six years from the date of the injury in these circumstances. Section 4123.52 divided injured workers with substantially the same injuries causing the same degree or extent of disability into two classes for determining eligibility for the exercise of continuing jurisdiction by the Commission. The court held that as the classification for determining eligibility for the exercise of the Commission's jurisdiction depended solely upon prior receipt of a form of disability compensation, a fortuity which bore no rational relationship to the nature of the injury or the need for another form of compensation, and as such application of the statute lead to arbitrary and capricious results, the statute was in conflict with the equal protection requirements of the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, along with three other individuals, was charged with one count of aggravated riot, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.02, and with two counts of assault, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.13. Subsequently, the assault charges were dismissed and defendant was found guilty of the lesser-included offense of disorderly conduct. A fight between defendant, the owner of a tavern, and several patrons with police occurred outside of the tavern. There was conflicting testimony as to whether the fight was prompted by police actions or the conduct of the tavern patrons. On appeal, defendant argued that he was denied his right to a speedy trial. Defendant also raised other assignments of error, including that the indictment failed to allege defendant &quot;persisted&quot; in his disorderly conduct. The court determined that defendant was not brought to trial within the time required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.72 where there was nothing in the record to show why the trial was delayed. The court also found that it was not necessary to allege persistence in the indictment for disorderly conduct under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11(E).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the municipal court erred in failing to find Oregon, Ohio, Zoning Ordnance 219, &sect;&sect; 1103.31, 1119.02 (1973) unconstitutional in prohibiting the keeping of more than three dogs in an A-1 Agricultural District. Oregon, Ohio, Zoning Ordnance 219, &sect; 1119.02 did not provide for maintaining a kennel, which was defined in Oregon, Ohio, Zoning Ordnance 219, &sect; 1103.31 as the keeping and care of more than three dogs that were more than six months old. The uses described in Oregon, Ohio, Zoning Ordnance 219, &sect; 1119.02 were the only lawful uses of property in the A-1 district, thus the keeping of more than three dogs on property within that district amounted to a violation of the ordinance. The city drew a reasonable and constitutional distinction between the dogs and livestock, and the ordinances were proper under the municipal police powers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee, city board of zoning appeals denied the request of appellant landowner for a zoning variance. The landowner appealed that judgment to the Common Pleas Court of Summit County (Ohio) that affirmed the board's decision. The landowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner argued that the trial court erred in denying its request for variance on the basis that the zoning and sign regulations as applied to the landowner's location were unconstitutional, arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable. The landowner argued that any zoning regulation, enacted pursuant to police power was valid only if necessary for the preservation of public health, safety, moral, or welfare. He argued that the total sum of the evidence before the board indicated nothing about the erection of the sign to be inconsistent with those objections. The board held that the sign regulation was needed to ensure optimum visual exposure for all property owners. The extent of enforcement for the general welfare was a matter for local determination. The court found the resolution regulating the size of signs was a reasonable exercise of police power. That resolution was neither unconstitutional per se nor in its present application. The court held that the judgment was supported by the evidence and applicable law because the resolution and its application restricting sign size served as a valid public interest.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was arrested for soliciting a person of the same gender for sex in an offensive manner. The court reversed defendant's conviction. The court held that &sect; 2907.07(B) was unconstitutional for overbreadth because it violated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment, and for vagueness because it violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Because the Ohio Criminal statutes did not prohibit adults from engaging in sexual activity, including homosexual acts, in private and with the consent of the participants, adults were free to consent to and could engage in any type of sexual activity they chose. Having chosen to decriminalize private homosexual acts between consenting adults, the legislature could not, logically, retain the criminal nature of proposals to engage in such acts, even if the proposal was personally offensive to the person addressed. How else was the actor to determine whether or not the other person will consent. Also, offensive language alone, however discordant with widely accepted values, was not subject to governmental regulation.</SPAN></P>

On appeal from the trial court's dismissal of the complaint, the court held that the trial court did not err in ruling that Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the zoning ordinance was declared unconstitutional as applied to the landowner's property, the landowner petitioned for a building permit and was advised by the city that the petition would not be accepted for uses other than those permitted under the multi-family residential zoning ordinance. The trial court awarded the landowner further relief for the city's failure to comply with the declaratory judgment. The court overruled the city's contention that the trial court should have declared what zoning was constitutionally permissible because zoning was not a function of the judiciary. The court also held that the inclusion of attorney fees in the assessment of costs was proper because the trial court found that the city had acted in bad faith in conspiring to prevent the landowner from the best use of its property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the municipal court (Ohio), which, after a bench trial, convicted him of vehicular homicide, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;2903.07.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of vehicular homicide, in that he negligently caused the death of another while operating a motor vehicle, based on evidence that he caused the death of another by crossing left of the center line, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.25. The court affirmed the judgment. The trial court did not err in overruling defendant's motion for dismissal at the close of the State's case. In Ohio, the unexcused failure to comply with &sect; 4511.25 constituted negligence per se. At the end of the State's case, the State had established that death resulted from defendant's vehicle being left of center. This was a substantial lapse from due care. Thus, the motion for dismissal was properly overruled. Moreover, it was defendant's burden to provide the legal excuse for being left of center, which he did not provide. Thus, there was sufficient evidence to sustain the judgment and findings. The court further held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.07 was not vague and was constitutionally definite.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a bridal boutique manager and the boutiques, challenged the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Lucas County, which affirmed the decision of appellee, the Chief Inspector of Weights and Measures of the City of Toledo (Ohio), who found that the boutiques violated the Toledo Consumer Sales Practices Act, Toledo, Ohio, Municipal Code ch. 26, and signed a cease and desist order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The City adopted Toledo, Ohio, Municipal Code 26-7-30, which provided that the Chief Inspector of Weights and Measures was to investigate, hear, and determine complaints of violations of the Toledo Consumer Sales Practices Act. A complaint was made against the bridal boutiques and the Chief Inspector issued a cease and desist order after a member of his staff investigated the allegations, drafted a complaint, and presented the case to the Chief Inspector at a hearing. On appeal to the trial court, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2506, found that the decision was not unlawful, unreasonable, or against the manifest weight of the evidence, and affirmed. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. Violation of the cease and desist order was a first degree misdemeanor. From the totality of the circumstances, the substantial penalties which could be imposed, and the doubts which existed as to the scope of review when the violations reached a court of law, the combination of investigatory and adjudicatory powers within this particular agency deprived the manager and the boutiques of their constitutional rights to due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed a pre-trial motion to dismiss the complaint, alleging that &sect; 2919.22(A) was unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied in the instant action. The motion was overruled, and defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 2919.22(A) clearly apprized people of ordinary intelligence of their legal responsibilities toward their children and what conduct would render them subject to criminal penalties. The court also found that the meaning of the statute was clarified when considered with the definition of &quot;neglected child&quot; in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.03. Although the court noted &sect; 2919.22(A) had been declared unconstitutional by a neighboring court, it held that it was not bound by that decision and that an appeal of that decision to the state supreme court had not been perfected on its merits. While defendant argued that the complaint did not specify the alleged violation with particularity, the court determined that she could have requested a bill of particulars pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 7(E). Because she did not do so, the court held that she waived any error by going to trial.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4735.18(A), (B), (F), and (U).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission ordered the real estate broker's license to be conditionally suspended, based on the broker's compliance with an order not to violate advertising provisions of the Ohio Revised Code. The broker had formulated a &quot;For Sale By Owner&quot; program whereby a home seller entered into a six-month exclusive listing agreement but retained the right to sell the home by himself in the first 30 days. If the homeowner did not sell the home within the 30-day period, the broker would have a regular exclusive listing for the remaining months. The Commission upheld a hearing officer's determination that the advertising, yard signs, and sales agreement violated Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4735.18(A), (B), (F), and (U). The trial court affirmed the decision. The broker argued that the decision was not supported by substantial evidence and was not in accordance with law. The court found that the Commission's decision was supported by substantial evidence and that the procedure comported with due process of law. The court, however, vacated the judgment because the Commission failed to supply a standard by which the broker could shape his conduct and by which such conduct could be judged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a juvenile when the offense occurred, appealed a decision from the Common Pleas Court of Coshocton County, Juvenile Division (Ohio), which found him guilty for exceeding the speed limit. The trial court acknowledged certain ambiguities in the original order and modified its entry by ordering defendant's operator's license suspended for a period of six months with a credit for two months suspension already invoked.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The license issued to defendant was a probationary license. The conviction was his third offense. The hearing was on the day on which defendant became 18 years of age. His license under the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.162 would have been revoked for a period of one year. However, the Registrar of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles determined that the conviction was not before defendant's 18th birthday and returned defendant's license to him. The prosecuting attorney requested clarification of the initial order, at which time the trial court entered its modification, suspending the license for 6 months. On appeal, defendant argued that the statute under which he was sentenced Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.356(B) was void for indefiniteness. The court found that the statute, which permitted the trial court to treat defendant as a juvenile was constitutional. It also held that license suspension was not a penalty for a criminal offense, but a forfeiture of a permit for the protection of the public. The six month suspension, while inconvenient, did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

The parents were also found to be in contempt of a court order requiring them to enroll the children in a school chartered by the State of Ohio or to produce their children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parents were charged with civil neglect for failure to send their children to school, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3321.18. When they refused to obey an order compelling them to send the children to a chartered school, they were found to be in contempt of the order. On appeal, the court first found that the juvenile court had exclusive original jurisdiction under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.03 because the matter concerned civil and not criminal neglect of the children and that the school board had the right to proceed under that statute. The fact that &sect; 2151.03 proscribed neglect, without defining neglect, did not make the statute void for vagueness. In addition, &sect; 2151.03(C) required the parents to provide the children with an education. While a parent could provide an education at home, the law required that the education be provided by a properly qualified teacher. Although the mother was certified to teach certain high school subjects, she had not obtained a certificate to teach elementary school topics. The court found that the certification requirement did not conflict with the parents' stated beliefs.</SPAN></P>

Prior to defendant's testimony, during which he denied being the driver, the trial court asked him in the presence of the jury if he was aware of his right to remain silent. Defendant was convicted and he appealed. In affirming, the appellate court ruled that, assuming error in the questioning of defendant before the jury about his right to remain silent, the error was harmless because there were no affirmative indications that he was prejudiced. The culpable mental state set out in &sect; 2913.51(A) required the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused either had actual knowledge of or reasonable cause to believe in the unlawful source of the subject property and it was not impermissibly vague. Moreover, the provisions of Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The passenger was in an automobile driven by her mother. She suffered injuries in a one-car accident. The passenger's husband at that time had in effect two policies of insurance with the insurer. The mother also had in effect a policy of automobile insurance with the insurer. The passenger claimed that the trial court erred in: (1) finding the mother was not an uninsured motorist, (2) finding the mother was a member of the passenger's household, (3) finding that the exclusion in one of the policies was not against public policy, and (4) granting judgment to the insurer. The court found that the mother's policy did not cover the individual's injuries. Therefore, for all intent and purpose as to the individual, the mother was an uninsured motorist, but the trial court was correct in that the mother was a member of the individual's household. Further, the court agreed that the exclusion in the policy was void as being contrary to the Ohio Revised Code and against public policy. The household exclusion provision was contrary to Ohio Rev.

Upon review, the court affirmed, holding that the evidence showed, clearly and convincingly, that the twins were dependent within the meaning of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.04. The court determined that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.353(D) was not void for vagueness under the Due Process Clause because the mother made no claim that the procedural requirements for termination of her parental rights were not met. The court found that the evidence proved that the twins' great grandmother was not a suitable person to have custody because of her age and poor health. The court found that the best interests of the children were served by termination of the mother's parental rights and by placing permanent custody with the Board.</SPAN></P>

It found that the record revealed prejudicial error that was not assigned by defendant in his appeal, but that the court had discretion to notice the error because it affected defendant's substantial rights, even though it was not brought to the attention of the trial court. It then determined that trial judge improperly penalized defendant by disbelieving his alibi and finding him guilty on the basis of the appellant's post-arrest silence. The court held that there was there is an implicit assurance in the Miranda warnings that silence in the wake of the warnings carried no penalty. Further, the use for impeachment purposes of defendant's silence at the time of arrest and after receiving Miranda warnings violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The ex-husband filed a motion for relief from the alimony portion of the judgment, which the trial court overruled. Upon review, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling the ex-husband's motion for relief from judgment. The court held that the ex-husband was not entitled to relief from the judgment because he failed to establish that he was entitled to relief on the ground of fraud as alleged in his motion under Ohio R. Civ. P. 60(B). The court determined that the ex-husband had not filed his motion within the one-year allowed by Rule 60(B), and thus, it was not timely filed. The court found that the alimony provision was not contrary to law and did not exceed the trial court's authority under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3105.18.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">African-American real estate brokers filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against city officials, requesting that the trial court declare unconstitutional certain city ordinances which allegedly violated the brokers' right to freedom of speech, interfered with the free exercise of their business, and restrained competition in real estate transactions in the predominantly white suburbs. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment granting the officials' motion to dismiss the brokers' action but for reasons other than those stated by the trial court. The court concluded that the brokers failed to name as defendants the municipal corporations where the ordinances were passed. Additionally, the brokers failed to serve the Ohio Attorney General with a copy of their complaint, and thus, they failed to comply with the mandatory jurisdictional requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.12. As such, the trial court was precluded from properly rendering declaratory relief, and since the trial court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the merits of the brokers' complaint for declaratory relief, its finding sustaining the validity of the ordinances was void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for the shooting death of a police officer. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting photographs of the deceased into evidence and failing to properly instruct the jury with respect to the defense of intoxication and mental impairment. Defendant also claimed the trial court's imposition of the death penalty was against the manifest weight of the evidence and was not in accordance with state laws regarding mitigating circumstances in capital cases. The appellate court rejected these contentions. The black and white photographs of the deceased were properly admitted to reflect the angle, position, and nature of the victim's wounds, the places from which the shots were fired, and the weapons used to commit the offense. The trial court's jury instruction concerning intoxication was proper in that it placed no burden upon defendant either to go forward with evidence or in respect of a risk of non-persuasion. Finally, defendant's mitigation hearing did not take on any of the legal or forensic aspects of an adversary proceeding, and the trial court's remarks merely referred to the risk of nonpersuasion that defendant bore.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court held, among other things, that: (1) the imposition of the death penalty was not cruel and unusual punishment; (2) the trial court did not err in refusing to compel discovery of prior statements and grand jury testimony given by a prosecution witness who was not a codefendant; (3) the verdict was not against the manifest weight of the evidence; (4) jury instructions were proper; (5) no improper evidence was admitted; (6) the trial court did not err in concluding that unidentified recorded conversations were seized according to the law; (7) the trial court did not err in refusing to declare a FBI agent to be a hostile witness; (8) the trial court's reliance on a court-appointed psychiatrist was not erroneous; and (9) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to change the venue because it was not shown that it was impossible to seat impartial jurors in the forum county.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the trial court, holding that the trial court erred in the standard of review it applied to the whole record in reaching its final determination on the basis of the administrative transcript and the additional evidence. The final entry was based on the trial court's own findings, as though the trial court had heard the matter de novo. Specifically, the trial court found that the evidence clearly and convincingly proved the annexation would benefit the subject of property. Such a determination was error because the trial court should have applied the statutory standards of review set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.04.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the gubernatorial intercession on behalf of defendant was limited to a restoration of defendant's right and privileges of citizenship. The court held that such a restoration did not equate with a pardon. The court concluded that defendant, by virtue of his conviction for a felony of violence, was disabled from knowingly acquiring, having carrying, or using a firearm until he obtained relief from that disability pursuant to Ohio Rev.

After the trial court denied their motion to dismiss, defendants entered a plea of no-contest to the gambling charge. On appeal, the court held that where a defendant claimed that his conduct was permissible under legislative enactments, a plea of &quot;not guilty&quot; was available to raise that issue. The court found that defendants' &quot;no contest&quot; plea did not preserve in error the claim that the trial court erroneously found them guilty without adequate factual or legal basis to support the finding proffered by defendants, but that it would have been otherwise if the claim were that the statute in question was unconstitutional on its face.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The action was first commenced by appellee executrix. The charities in question had been devised more than 25 percent of the testator's net probate estate within six months of the testator's death. On appeal, the charities contended that &sect; 2107.06, which invalidated bequests to charities to the extent they exceeded 25 percent of the net estate if the testator died within six months of the bequest was an unconstitutional violation of the equal protection clause because the classification was unrelated to the objective of the statute. The court ruled that the classification was constitutional because it bore a rational relationship to a permissible state objective. The court held that it was no requirement of equal protection that all evils of the same genus be eradicated or none at all. The court reasoned that the six months rule of &sect; 2107l.06 could operate to permit bequests that were irrationally made and void those that were the product of careful consideration, but that fact alone did not render the rule unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant participated in an armed bank robbery in which a bank guard was shot and killed. Defendant offered an alibi in his defense and testified that he had not seen his codefendant since several weeks before the bank robbery. The State recognized that testimony identifying defendant and his accomplice as the same two individuals who had robbed a truck rental store the day before was inadmissible, but argued that when defendant elected to become a witness, he was subject to cross-examination concerning his involvement in the unrelated truck rental armed robbery because it bore upon his credibility. The court agreed and held that a charge to the jury with respect to the rebuttal evidence about the unrelated crime had not been improper. Further, the court found that defendant's Fifth Amendment rights were not violated by such a use of defendant's rebuttal testimony. However, the court determined that the State's failure to provide defendant with discovery of a key witness as to the prior offense, as required by Ohio R. Crim. P. 16(B)(1)(g), constituted reversible error. Finally, the court concluded that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.58, the alibi statute, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

At a hearing requested by the licensee, the licensee reiterated that she was not going to install the sprinkler system. When the Director's revocation determination was administratively upheld, the licensee appealed to the common pleas court that, in turn, also upheld the Director's determination. On a subsequent appeal, the Director again prevailed. The court held that none of the licensee's 13 assigned errors had any merit. First and foremost, the court held that the licensee's repeated declaration that she was not going to install the required sprinkler system obviated the need for any additional evidence because there was no evidence that would change the result. It rejected claims that the revocation notice was defective in any of a number of ways; that the Director was not entitled to revoke on the grounds stated therein; or that the statute requiring the fire suppression system was unconstitutional on any claimed basis.</SPAN></P>

The trial court issued a permanent injunction restraining the owners from using the building other than in conformity to the zoning ordinance or with any variance subsequently granted.

Injunctive relief was a proper remedy for the enforcement of the zoning ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The therapist had a contract with the association to prosecute an action in federal district court claiming that a federal statute was unconstitutional as applied to physical therapists. Without the approval of the association, the therapist appealed the federal action to the United States Supreme Court. The therapist filed a first action in state court seeking reimbursement of the attorney fees and costs incurred in appealing the federal action. The association filed a counterclaim. The therapist dismissed his action, even after being warned by the trial court that Ohio R. Civ. P. 13(A) regarding compulsory counterclaims applied. A trial proceeded on the association's counterclaim finding no breach of contract. In the case at bar, the court concluded that the breach of contract count was barred under the doctrine of res judicata. The court determined that the count against the attorneys was barred by collateral estoppel as the claim could have been brought in the first state court action. The court found that the claim against the officers and directors was properly dismissed as the therapist failed to state a claim upon which relief could have been granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injured party filed an action against the suppliers for negligence and breach of warranty based on his contracting obstructive lung disease by inhaling asbestos from the suppliers' products. The trial court granted the suppliers' motions to dismiss the complaint because the action was not brought within the applicable statute of limitations. Affirming, the court found that the application of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.10 did not deny the injured party his rights of due process and equal protection of the laws because the rule that the one-year statute of limitations was not tolled until the negligence was discovered did not apply to the injured party's action. The tolling rule was limited to surgical malpractice suits, for instance, where a foreign surgical object was found inside a patient or incorrect blood tests were conducted. The determination whether to toll the statute of limitation in cases of asbestos related lung disease should have been considered and deliberated in a legislative body, and if it was judicially determined, it was for the state supreme court, not lower courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that a regulation adopted by the Director was unconstitutional. The trial court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action because the Ohio General Assembly had vested such jurisdiction in the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and there was a proceeding involving the same parties and issues pending before that agency. The court overturned the trial court's judgment. The court held that the existence of an administrative remedy did not ordinarily preclude a court of common pleas from exercising jurisdiction in declaratory judgment with respect to the validity of a regulation or a statute. It was only where the statute had expressly made the administrative remedy exclusive and expressly precluded the exercise of the general civil jurisdiction conferred upon the court of common pleas that such a court was precluded from exercising jurisdiction in declaratory judgment to determine the validity of a statute or regulation. With respect to environmental protection matters, there was no statutory prohibition of the exercise by the court of common pleas of its general civil jurisdiction conferred upon it by law.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered convictions against the owner and its manager and found the agency guilty as well. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that although the constitutionality of the statutes in question was not raised below, it was obvious that an appeal on that issue was anticipated. The court held that the statute in question regulated the collection of rental information, and while the State was within its powers to license people within its limits to engage in certain businesses, the statute bore no reasonable relationship to protecting the public interest. Further, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4735.01(A)(10) was arbitrary and discriminatory in nature and constitutionally invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother argued that the complaint violated Ohio Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 2151.27, 2151.23, 2151.04 and Ohio R. Juv. P. 10, the trial court did not appoint a guardian ad litem, grandparents were not summoned, the entire procedure was unconstitutionally vague, the trial court improperly accepted evidence, and there was insufficient evidence to support the finding of dependency. The court reversed based on an error in jurisdiction. The trial court initially acquired jurisdiction in a proceeding filed for and resulting in a temporary change of custody and retained jurisdiction. Later, a motion for a change of permanent custody was filed that failed to sufficiently allege that the infant was in fact a dependent child. Under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2151.353, the filing of a complaint containing a prayer requesting permanent custody, sufficiently apprising the parents of the grounds, and the service of summons upon the parents explaining permanent divestiture of parental rights were prerequisite to a valid adjudication that a child was neglected or dependent for the purpose of obtaining an order for permanent custody divesting parental rights. The remaining assertions of error lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

Defendant heirs filed a cross-petition in ejectment and for damages against the grantee. A common pleas court (Ohio) entered judgment for the city under the Ohio Marketable Title Act and against defendant heirs on their cross-petition. Plaintiff and defendant heirs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The grantors conveyed property to a village, stipulating that the property was to be used only for public purposes; otherwise it would revert to the grantors or their heirs. The village was annexed by a city. The annexation instrument provided that the property was to be used for public purposes, but no mention was made of the possibilities of reverter. Over 40 years later, the city conveyed the property to the grantee, who used the property for private business ventures. The court held that the reversionary interests of plaintiff and defendant heirs were extinguished by the Act. The annexation constituted root of title under Ohio Rev Code Ann. &sect; 5301.47(E) and (F) because it was the most recent transaction affecting title. Because the root of tile was determined over 40 years earlier by the annexation, plaintiff and defendant heirs were required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5301.49(A) to file a preserving notice to preserve their reversionary interests. They failed to do so. The Act was not unconstitutional. It was rationally related to the legitimate state interest of simplifying land transactions, and persons with future interests were able to preserve their interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorney represented an indigent putative father in paternity proceedings. He requested that the costs of a blood test be prepaid by the State, which motion was denied by the trial court. The attorney then filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, which was granted. As part of his petition, the attorney alleged that the juvenile court judge &quot;threatened&quot; that, if the paternity case was not settled and if the indigent client was found guilty at trial, then the client would be assessed significant monies; and, if they were not immediately paid, he would be incarcerated. The court reversed the judgment and vacated the citation of contempt. It was impossible to determine conclusively and beyond a reasonable doubt that the juvenile court judge did not threaten the attorney, and it was clear to the court that the use of the word &quot;threaten&quot; in the mandamus petition was descriptive in nature, intending to aid the attorney in establishing the primary allegation of the petition.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient filed a medical malpractice action against the doctors. Both parties appealed the judgment. In affirming, the court held that the patient had proven sufficient facts to toll the statute of limitations. The court found that where a defendant temporarily left the state after a cause of action accrued against him, he departed from the state within the meaning of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.15. The court further held that the patient produced sufficient expert medical testimony that the doctor had committed malpractice. Expert evidence, as related by a third doctor, whose medical efforts were used physically to attempt to overcome the results of the doctor's negligence, was extensive. The reasons for the patient's condition when he was brought to the third doctor's attention were thoroughly brought out for the jury's consideration. Finally, the trial court correctly found that the second doctor, a foreign medical graduate but unlicensed to practice in Ohio, was protected under the one-year statute of limitation as to malpractice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The building had been used to store fireworks, a use allowed as a continuance of use under the township's zoning ordinance. The board denied approval for reconstruction on grounds that the building and its use did not meet present zoning requirements. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case. Prior to adoption of &sect; 7.5-1, the owner's use of the building as a fireworks warehouse was not prohibited by law and was a legal non-conforming use under &sect; 7.5-1. Jerusalem Township, Ohio, Zoning Resolution &sect; 7.5-5 (1964) limited reconstruction of non-conforming buildings when damaged to the extent of more than 75 percent of value at the time of the damage. The owner's building had never been a non-conforming building, and its non-conforming use was allowed under the zoning ordinance. The owner's due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16 were violated by the taking of the owner's pre-existing non-conforming use of his property and notice of hearing requirements of Jerusalem Township, Ohio, Zoning Resolution &sect; 8.3-3 (1964) were not met by the board.</SPAN></P>

He claimed in part that his conviction had violated double jeopardy and that the kidnapping statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.01, had been improperly applied to his case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During defendant's trial, the trial court had dismissed several counts, permitted amendment of the felonious assault charge, and then held further trial before a second jury after a continuance. Defendant argued that it had been error to permit amendment of the indictment after the prosecution had rested its case, that he had been placed in double jeopardy, that the kidnapping statute did not apply, and that it had been improper to refuse to charge on lesser included offenses of aggravated assault, aggravated menacing, and trespassing. The court found that: (1) under Ohio R. Crim. P. 7(D), the amendment of the felonious assault charge had been proper where it had not changed the name or identity of the crime charged; (2) jeopardy did not attach to the further prosecution after the dismissal of the first jury; (3) it had been proper to refuse to charge on the lesser included offenses where there was no reasonable trier of fact that could find defendant guilty of the included offenses and not guilty of the charges; and (4) the attack on the kidnapping statute's constitutionality was waived as not raised in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction had been based on a dispute with two police officers who had come to his house to serve him on an unrelated warrant.

The court found that: (1) the statute in question was in fact vague in content and unconstitutionally overbroad in its regulation of defendant's speech; and (2) it was unnecessary to address defendant's other claims in view of the reversal of his conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The complaint had failed to comply with the statute by failing to contain a verified listing of collateral sources of benefits available and by containing a pray seeking a specific money damage amount.

Plaintiff wife filed a claim for loss of services and consortium. The Court of Claims of Ohio dismissed plaintiffs' complaints under Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband suffered injury to his arm and shoulder when he nearly fell in an interior stairwell of a State-owned building. Neither the husband nor the wife filed a notice of intent to file a claim against the State within 180 days under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2743.16; however, their claims were filed within two years. The claims court gave the husband and the wife an opportunity to prove they had good cause for failing to file the notice; however, no good cause was shown. On appeal, the court concluded that &sect; 2743.16 applied to the husband's claim. The husband's failure to show good cause warranted dismissal of his complaint. The court ruled, however, that &sect; 2743.16 did not apply to the wife's claim and that a four-year statute of limitations applied to the wife's complaint. Because the wife was not required to file the notice and because her complaint was filed timely, the claims court erred in dismissing the wife's complaint. The court rejected argument of the husband and the wife that &sect; 2743.16 was unconstitutional because there was no discrimination in the constitutional sense. The classifications in &sect; 2743.16 were reasonable and did not result in a denial of equal protection.</SPAN></P>
