</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent passed away while a patient at a Veterans' Administration hospital. The decedent left no heirs entitled to his property. The United States claimed that under 38 U.S.C.S. &sect; 17-17j, the condition precedent to the decedent's care was his agreement that if he had no heirs, his personal property and money would be transferred to the United States. The trial court's judgment upholding the United States' claim was affirmed. The United States submitted prima facie proof that the decedent left no heirs. It was previously held that &sect; 17-17j did not violate U.S. Const. amend. X. The court held that the contract was valid; although the decedent's obligations under the contract only took effect upon his death, the obligation to the United States was valid. As the decedent entered into a contract to convey property after his death to the United States and the United States provided care to the decedent as required by the contract, there was no reason why the contract could not be enforced; therefore, equity could provide relief to the United States.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 48-317 to 48-321 (1949). Plaintiff contended that the statutes were unconstitutional and did not confer power on the KAB to issue bonds thereunder. The court stated that in order for the legislature to extend exemptions beyond those expressly designated in the constitution, they had to have a public purpose and be designed to promote the general welfare. The court concluded that National Guard armories had a public purpose. The National Guard was an important and well-recognized element of the national defense. Provision was made for the militia in the Kansas Constitution. Kan. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2 made it the duty of the legislature to provide for its organization, equipment and discipline. The court held that the armory buildings provided for by the act were necessary for the carrying out of that mandate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff elector initiated an action in the nature of quo warranto to test the validity of 1951 Kan. Laws ch. 395, particularly &sect; 41 thereof, codified as Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 72-1627 (1951 Supp.) pursuant to which defendant, the board of education of a school district, annexed certain territory for school purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district annexed all of three other school districts. The elector resided in one of the other districts, and objected to the annexation, which burdened him as taxpayer with the preexisting debts of the school district. In denying any relief, the court first held that &sect; 72-1627 did not violate the single subject requirement of Kan. Const. art. II, &sect; 16. The court noted that the subject of the legislation in question was assimilated to the other provisions of the act and was germane and pertinent to it, which satisfied this constitutional provision. The court then held that Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 72-1627 (1951 Supp.) did not represent a delegation of legislative power to the school district in violation of Kan. Const. art. II, &sect; 1. On the contrary the school district's annexation recommendation was subject to direct challenge by as few as 25 percent of the voters, so the school district did not even have the final say in the matter. Finally the court held that it was perfectly proper under Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 72-1627 (1951 Supp.) for a district to annex any part of another district - or even all of it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the relief the elector sought.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed the order of the Washington District Court (Kansas) that denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus against respondent warden after the warden revoked the inmate's parole without a hearing and had him arrested and reimprisoned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While on parole the inmate was arrested for disturbing the peace and was confined in the county jail. The parole officer investigated and reported the incident to the warden, who issued an order to arrest the inmate as a paroled prisoner who violated parole. The inmate claimed that he was deprived of due process by not being granted a hearing of the revocation of parole, that Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 62-1525 was unconstitutional, and that the parole agreement was improperly revoked. The court held that the legislature, in &sect; 62-1525, gave the warden authority to revoke the inmate's parole without a hearing and to issue arrest warrants. No due process rights attached to the inmate's parole, and the revocation of parole without a hearing did not violate due process rights. Because the inmate was still in custodia legis while on parole, the authority of the warden to revoke parole and retake inmates was not an unreasonable and unlawful delegation of power. By accepting the terms of parole, the inmate was precluded the authority of the warden to terminate parole because of the inmate's violation of its terms.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. II, &sect; 17, in that it was a special law where a general law could have been made applicable. The quo warranto action was within the discretion of the county attorney because the constitutionality of a statute was at issue. Only 3 of 105 counties in the state fell within the classification created by the statute. The court concluded that the statute was a special law where a general could have been made applicable. The court was unable to ascertain any genuine or substantial relation between the classification in G.S. 2-1907a and the subject matter of the act. The classification was not a natural one and did not rest upon real and substantial distinctions that had a reasonable and substantial relation to the subject matter involved.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By original proceeding in quo warranto, plaintiff State of Kansas sought to oust defendants, a board of county commissioners, a county clerk, and a county treasurer, from incurring obligations against and expending funds raised by tax levy under Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 39-364 (1949), a tangible property taxing statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State alleged that acting pursuant to &sect; 39-364, the county commissioners made an annual levy upon all tangible property of their county. The State alleged that &sect; 39-364 was a special revenue law. The State sought a declaration that &sect; 39-364 was repugnant to Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 17, that the board of county commissioners be ousted from entering into any contracts, or incurring any obligations on behalf of the county, and that the county treasurer be ordered to refund the sums raised to the taxpayers. Defendants denied that &sect; 39-364 was a special revenue law repugnant to the state constitution, alleged that no taxpayers had protested, and contended that there was no foundation for an order directing a refund of the sums raised without any protest. The court denied the writ and entered judgment for defendants. There was nothing unlawful about the object for which the levies were made, remodeling or rebuilding a county farm home for the poor. Second, the taxpayers, as individuals, were interested in the litigation. The State had no interest. No taxpayer filed a protest. The court would not give the taxpayers relief to which they would not be entitled had they even filed an action.</SPAN></P>

The decedent, a railroad engineer, was killed when the train he was operating collided with a motor transport belonging to the association.

In its answer, the association argued that the decedent's careless operation of his train was the proximate cause of his death. Furthermore, the administrator argued that the decedent assumed the risks associated with the operation of a train. Thereafter, the association filed motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdicts and motions for a new trial. On appeal, the court held that trial court properly overruled the association's demurrer because the probative facts and the circumstances immediately proceeding the collision created a question of fact for the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee became ill and her husband assumed operation of the business. The licensee gave her husband authority to engage in all acts necessary to the operation of her business. It was alleged that the husband sold retail alcohol and did so on a Sunday. The licensee denied knowledge of the illegal acts. The director suspended the licensee's retail liquor license. The district court found that there were not sufficient members on the board at the time the decision was rendered and that the director's actions were arbitrary and capricious. On appeal, the court reversed. First, the court held that, under Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 77-201, a majority of the board was present when the decision was made because the statute creating the board provided that it was to consist of three members and a majority was two. Second, the court held that all valid rules and regulations promulgated by the director were binding upon all licensees and were enforceable by him through the power of suspension or cancellation of licenses. Thus, the licensee was responsible at all times for the acts and conduct of her employee in the operation of the business even absent authorization, knowledge, or approval.</SPAN></P>

The tax was an ad valorem tax under Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 72-5715 (1949) on property owned by the taxpayer, and the taxpayer contended that it was unconstitutional under Kan. Const. art.

The facts showed that the forum county was the only county that fit into a certain population category under the statute, which allowed ad valorem taxation for the purpose of high school funding. The trial court affirmed the tax, not because the statute conferred constitutional taxing powers on the county but because a liberal interpretation of laws pertaining to schools and education was warranted. The taxpayer contended that &sect; 72-5715 was a special law, which was enacted where a general law could have been made applicable, and that, if the classification to which it was subject was invalid, then the remainder of the statute was void. The Board contended that county population was not arbitrary and unreasonable in a funding statute and that prior judicial interpretations supported the taxation. On appeal the court reversed, noting that the legislature had enacted similar legislation conferring the benefits of &sect; 72-5715 on all counties and that a general law providing all counties the same benefits as &sect; 72-5715 had provided to one had been made applicable to all.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, an irrigation district and its officers, appealed the judgment of the Republic District Court (Kansas), which entered judgment in favor of plaintiff taxpayers in the taxpayers' action to enjoin the district and its officers from proceeding pursuant to a contract with the federal government. The prayer was for an injunction and a finding that 1951 Kan. Sess. Laws ch. 304 violated the state constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers owned irrigable land within the district and some of them had signed the petition for the organization of the district, in accordance with Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-701 (1947). Pursuant to Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-721 (1949), the district entered into a contract with the United States for the construction of irrigation works and it had filed an action in district court for the approval of the contract, which provided for assessments against the land. The taxpayers argued that under the law as it existed when the district was organized, they had a right to pass upon the contract and that the right was taken away by 1951 Kan. Sess. Laws ch. 304. In reversing the trial court, the court held it would not do to hold that the statute in force when the district was organized constituted such a contract between the state, the district and the taxpayers that it could not be changed by subsequent legislation. Thus, the enactment of 1951 Kan. Sess. Laws ch. 304 did not impair a contract in violation of U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10. The limited power of the district court to modify assessments that were manifestly disproportionate did not confer legislative power to the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and directed it to dissolve the injunction issued against the officers restraining them from proceeding further with the action to affirm their contract with the United States.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed contending error in the commission having three practicing doctors and not at least one psychiatrist.

At no time or place in the consideration of the case did the insurer ever contend or suggest that the statute violated the federal constitution, nor did it contend that the court's opinion, either alone or in connection with the statute, violated the federal constitution. The court held that the insurer, by not raising the federal constitutional question in the case until after the court's decisions on the demurrers waived the right to present them.</SPAN></P>

The inmate's claim that he did not waive his preliminary examination was waived because the inmate proceeded to trial without complaining that he had not received a preliminary hearing and did not appeal on these grounds. Although the journal entry did not comply with Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 62-1516 (1949), it was corrected by a nunc pro tunc order to speak the truth and to comply with the statute, and the inmate failed to disclose how the judgment under which he was serving his sentence was invalid or irregular. Finally, the court held that the inmate's claim that Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21-107a (1949) was unconstitutional as enacted or as applied could not be sustained because the statute had repeatedly been held to be constitutional and because, when asked, the inmate did not assert any reasons why his prior conviction should not have been considered in imposing sentence under &sect; 21-107a.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The religious corporation filed its application for an order declaring an individual church extinct because the membership of the church was so diminished in number and financial strength as to render it impossible and impracticable for said church to maintain religious services or to protect its property from depletion.

The religious corporation claimed that the district court's ruling on its own motion on the constitutionality of the statutes under which it brought its action was in error. The court agreed that the district court erred because the question of constitutionality of the statutes was neither raised in the pleadings nor presented by the parties to the action at any stage of the proceedings. The court found nothing in the record to justify the district court in raising, on its own motion, the question of constitutionality of the foregoing statutes. The religious corporation brought itself within the provisions of the statutes, both by its pleadings and its evidence, and it was entitled to judgment for the relief prayed for.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the district court's judgment, concluding that precedent uniformly held that &sect; 12-2001 (and its predecessors) only applied to public utility franchises and that it covered a sphere of municipal authority that was entirely separate and distinct from ordinances that licensed and regulated the private users of the streets. Nothing in the title of 1949 Kan. Sess. Laws ch. 119 suggested that the amendment combined the old field of public utility franchises with a new field that granted cities the power to grant the privilege to use the streets in conducting any lawful private business. Further, giving the amendment the force and the effect that the City advocated would have clearly violated Kan. Const. art. II, &sect; 16 because doing so would have been outside of and foreign to the bill's title.</SPAN></P>

The court noted the general legislative scheme for enlarging city boundaries under Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-501 et seq. (1935). The board had original jurisdiction to determine whether the proposed boundary change could be made without manifest injury to persons owning real estate in the territory sought to be added and, if so, whether the annexation could be ordered. The first determination was judicial. The second determination was legislative. Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect;12-502a (1935) authorized parties aggrieved by boundary changes to appeal in district courts. Section 12-502a did not impermissibly delegate a legislative function to the judicial branch because the issues raised on appeal involved the board's factual findings. The entire statutory scheme was not void because there was room to review the factual findings without encroaching on the board's legislative function authorized under Kan. Const. art. II, &sect; 21.

Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-705 (1935). The judgment of the trial court was reversed on appeal with directions to deny the injunction.

The court defined the term wantonness as between negligence on one hand, and willful or malicious misconduct on the other. The court further held that under the guest statute, the act complained of need not be intentional or willful. The court found that the specific acts set forth in the petition were insufficient to allege wanton negligence. The petition did not sufficiently allege that defendants had reason to believe that the driver would likely, or probably, be stricken by an epileptic seizure while driving the car nor that defendants realized the imminence of such danger with a total disregard for the consequences.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandfather, a grandmother, and a grandson died when a train hit the grandfather's car while crossing railroad tracks. The parents filed two suits, one for the deceased grandson and one for an injured grandson, claiming that the grandfather's wantonness in driving caused the accident. Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect;, 8-122b (1935) allowed damages only for gross and wanton negligence. The parents claimed that the statute was unconstitutional. After the trial court held that the statute was not unconstitutional, but that a jury trial was required, both parties appealed. Affirming in both cases, the court said that, if the evidence was offered in district court, the parents' claims were for the triers of fact in the district court. The grandsons had been placed in the grandparents' custody by the parents. Whether the grandsons had any cause of action under the common law for damages resulting from the grandfather's negligence was not presented to the trial court or argued on appeal. However, there was no vested right in such a cause of action that prevented the legislature, acting under the police power of the state, from removing it under &sect; 8-122b.</SPAN></P>

The court entered judgment in favor of the Board holding that schools had always been considered the subject of special legislation. The classification made in ch. 396 was, in and of itself, entirely germane to the subject matter of the statute and was not patently unreasonable or capricious, thus was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association represented 27 members which had leased or rented their cars to various railroads. A two and one-half percent tax was imposed upon the revenue generated by the railroad cars pursuant to Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 79-917 (Supp. 1947). The association, which was unincorporated, contended that taxes imposed on the railroad cars were excessive and did not represent the true and lawful tax owed and challenged the validity of the applicable statutes. The commission ruled that the tax was valid and denied each refund claim. Later, the association filed suit in the district court seeking injunctive relief against the State Treasurer from placing the taxes collected into the general revenue fund. The district court ultimately sustained demurrers and dismissed the complaint. The court affirmed holding that all the property within the classification of the statute was taxed equally and uniformly under the statute for reasonable tax purposes and that thus all constitutional requirements were met. The presumption was in favor of the validity of a legislative classification if there was a reasonable basis for the classification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company ordered 18 railroad cars to ship cattle. There was a delay in shipping and the cattle arrived weighing much less than they did when loaded. The company brought an action for damages by reason of the delay and the railroads filed a demurrer to the evidence, which the district court sustained. The company appealed. In reversing and ordering a new trial, the court held that the jury did have sufficient facts before it to determine the amount of damages without entering into speculation and conjecture. The contention of the railroads that the notice claim provision section of the shipping contract was binding upon the company as a condition precedent to their action regardless of and notwithstanding Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 66-319 was without merit as &sect; 66-319 was to be strictly construed and had been held to be constitutional. The court overruled a portion of one case insofar as it was in conflict with &sect; 66-319, finding that the notice claim provision was a condition precedent to a recovery for such loss or damage and was unlawful and void as a part of the shipping contract by the language of &sect; 66-319.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the writ of habeas corpus and held that it had previously been determined that prosecution by information in Kansas for a felony was not a violation of any constitutional provision. The State provided affidavits from the superintendent of the reformatory and the day captain that described the inmate's living conditions while he was in solitary confinement and stated that at no time during his confinement was he asked to sign a waiver of counsel. The transcript of the proceedings showed that the inmate waived his right to counsel in open court and entered his guilty pleas. The court held that the record failed to show any intimidation or coercion and clearly revealed strict compliance with the statutory provisions enacted for the protection of persons accused of a crime.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 50-401 to 50-408 (1947 Supp.). The matter was tried upon an agreed statement of facts and the testimony of one witness for the State. The injunction restrained the wholesaler from selling cigarettes at less than its cost.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">According to the agreed statement of facts, the wholesaler sold cigarettes at less than its cost in order to match the price of a local competitor engaged in the same business. The wholesaler agreed that it made no effort to determine whether the competitor's sales were made for less than the competitor's cost. On cross-examination, the State's witness testified that he was familiar with the Act's exception for meeting the price of a competitor, that that was what the wholesaler was doing, and that he had no way to determine what the competitor's costs of business were. On appeal, the court held that on this record, there was no evidence on which the trial court could have concluded that the wholesaler had violated the Act. Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 50-402 (1947 Supp.) required that such sales had to be made with the intent to lessen competition or restrain trade. Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 50-405 (1947 Supp.) provided that the Act did not apply when the price of the merchandise was made in good faith to meet a competitor in the same locality. The wholesaler had met its burden, which was to prove that the sales were made in good faith to meet the price of a competitor in the same locality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court had before it an original proceeding brought by the prisoner for a writ of habeas corpus. The prisoner had been charged with unlawfully keeping and having in his possession intoxicating liquor for personal use and keeping and maintaining a common nuisance and keeping a place where intoxicating liquors were sold, bought, and given away. The statutes under which he was charged were Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 21-2101, 21-2130 (1935).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statutes under which the inmate was charged were passed before 1947 Kan. Sess. Laws 248 amended the Kan. Const. art. XV, &sect; 10. Before the amendment, art. XV prohibited the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors except for medical, scientific, and mechanical purposes. After the amendment, &sect; 10 stated that the legislature could provide permissibly for the prohibition of intoxicating liquors in certain areas and that the legislature could regulate the manufacture, sale, possession, and transportation of intoxicating liquors. The argument of the prisoner was that upon the amendment becoming effective, all the prohibitory liquor laws enacted since the adoption of the constitutional prohibition to a certain date that were predicated on the constitutional prohibition became void. The court ruled that Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 21-2101, 21-2130 (1935) were not based on the constitutional prohibition and were enacted using the general police power of the State. Moreover, the court ruled that 1947 Kan. Sess.

Gen. Stat. &sect; 62-1304 (1935), required the trial court to appoint counsel for an accused if he was unable financially to employ counsel, but only in the event defendant requested counsel. There was no allegation the prisoner requested counsel. Nevertheless when the trial court ascertained he was without counsel it appointed an experienced lawyer, to represent him. The record showed that the attorney inquired of the prisoner whether he knew he was entitled to a trial by jury to which the prisoner replied that he did but desired to enter his plea and be sentenced. The court found that the prisoner had not met the burden of proof with respect to this ground of his petition, or any of the other grounds.</SPAN></P>

Further, the inmate's contention that the information was void as it failed to define the offense for which he was being prosecuted failed as such was not necessary. Additionally, the inmate's allegations that his appointed attorney did not properly represent him, that the prosecuting officials used false testimony and suppressed evidence, that certain witnesses were not called on his behalf, and that he was coerced into pleading guilty were rejected as all were wholly uncorroborated. Finally, the inmate's allegation that the journal entry was illegally drawn because it did not contain any statutory numbers was without merit as the provisions of Kan. Gen.

The court held that the prisoner's claim that he should have been proceeded against by grand jury indictment rather than by information had no merit. The court also stated that prosecution by means of information instead of indictment was constitutional under the federal constitution. Further, the court ruled that the law did not require that the information set out the statute or specify the degree of murder with which he was charged. In addition, the court determined that the affidavits and the evidence in this case established that the prisoner was well and properly represented by counsel and that his rights were fully protected. Finally, the court noted that the prisoner's claim that his house was improperly search was insufficient because he made no showing in what way it injured him or prejudicially invaded his rights in this respect, if any.

The court also stated that failure of the information to specify the section of the statute under which he was charged with crime did not vitiate his conviction and the habitual criminal law of Kansas was not unconstitutional. Further, the court ruled that the state board of administration had a right to transfer him to the state penitentiary, under authority of Kan. Gen.

Appellants challenged a judgment from the Meade District Court (Kansas) that dismissed the action with prejudice as a moot case. The issue on appeal was whether the validating act, Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 72-5629 (Supp. 1947), applied under the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A school reorganization committee, created under Kan. Gen. Stat. ch. 72, art. 56 (1945), was considering a plan to disorganize the districts and attach them to an established territory. After hearings, the committee issued orders to implement the plan, which were upheld as reasonable and lawful. After filing their petition for injunctive relief, appellants sought a restraining order, contending that the legislature was considering the passage of amendments to the 1945 school reorganization law that would materially change the rights of the districts involved. The order was granted. Appellees' motion to vacate the order was sustained insofar as the order had restrained them from advertising and holding a school-district election in and for the reorganized district. Upon further hearing, the restraining order was dissolved. The court upheld the order of dismissal. Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 72-5629 referred specifically to acts already done. Because the acts resulted in an order to attach the districts to the established territory, &sect; 72-5629 validated the order as of the date set forth in the statute, which was in the past. The fact that suit was filed prior to that date was of no import.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate had won her primary and was elected as the Republican nominee for superintendent of public instruction. The canvassing board issued her a certificate of nomination.

The board found that she was not eligible, and directed the county clerk not to place her name on the general election ballot. The candidate argued that the legislature, by making &sect; 72-202a applicable only in counties which had a population of 15,000 or more made an unreasonable classification. The court held that such a determination was for the legislature. It was a common practice for the legislature to make classifications depending upon the population of the county or the city. The court reasoned that any classification based upon population was bound to have some slight inequalities, but that did not make it bad if the classification was reasonably adequate to accomplish the legislative purpose, which &sect; 72-202a did.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A flood control program was planned to control the possible flooding of the city. In two actions later consolidated for appeal, taxpayers of the city and the residents of outlying areas sought to enjoin the implementation of the plans on the basis that taxes on the property in the city would protect more property outside than in it, and that property outside the city would be improperly taken by eminent domain. The city claimed it was acting under the authority of Kan. Gen. Stat. ch. 12, art. 6 (1935) and under the additional authority of Kan. Gen. Stat. ch. 19, art. 33, (1945 Supp.). The district court sustained defendants' motions for judgments on the pleadings. Plaintiffs appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that the grant of power to the city by Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-635 (1945) was broad enough to warrant the waterway diversion. The court held that the city could not compel the lands outside the city limits, which may have been benefited by the plan, to bear a proportionate share of the cost of the plan. The city was permitted to impose a general tax on all the residents of the city to pay for the plan, whether the taxed property was benefitted or not.</SPAN></P>

The inmate's claim that he was denied the right of representation and of a fair and impartial trial by jury was also without merit because although the inmate did not permit his counsel to try the case for him, the attorney helped him in every way possible. The inmate was permitted to make an argument to the jury, as did his attorney, and the inmate's interests were safeguarded at every step. The inmate argued that the journal entry of judgment did not make any reference to sections of the statutes under which the verdict was rendered, in violation of Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 62-1516 (1947). The court held that the journal entry did not comply; however, the sentence was not void, as the journal entry was merely incomplete.

The railroad companies also argued that the writ was indefinite as to the procedures, which the City planned to follow. The court held that the right of the City to the writ was not clear from the ordinance. The court further found that the motion for the writ disclosed that two vital provisions of the statute, each a condition precedent to the issuance of the writ, had not been complied with.

Defendant claimed that the proceedings in the police court violated her constitutional right to a jury trial, particularly as she was also denied a jury trial on review in the district court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its original decision affirming defendant's conviction for running a tippling shop, the court ruled that she had waived her right to a jury trial on her appeal from the police court to the district court by failing to demand it. The court granted a rehearing after it obtained files showing that a denial of the right to a jury trial was one of the grounds defendant had relied on in a motion for a new trial in the district court. However, on rehearing the court affirmed that defendant had no constitutional right to a jury trial either in the police court or on an appeal from that court to the district court. After reviewing the history of constitutional provisions guaranteeing the right to trial by jury, and the decisional law regarding the intent of those provisions, the court concluded that the constitutions guaranteed the right but only as it existed before the adoption of the particular constitution. Since the adoption of the state constitution did not affect the power of cities to enforce their ordinances in a summary manner without a jury, defendant's constitutional rights were not violated when she was denied a jury trial in the police court or on appeal from its decision.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner prisoners were sisters and were being held in the City of Wichita's jail. Respondent in each case was the chief of police of the City. It was alleged that the prisoners were being held in isolation and quarantine by order of a city health officer and for violation of City of Wichita, Ka., Ordinance 6009.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoners refused to submit to examination for venereal disease. City of Wichita, Ka., Ordinance 6009 empowered the city physician to make examinations of persons suspected reasonably of having syphilis in an infectious stage or gonorrhea. The court held that where there were reasonable grounds for the city's health officer to believe that a patient was afflicted with a venereal disease, that officer had the power under Ordinance 6009 to restrain the suspected person and to cause forcibly that person to submit to an examination, but where a woman patient asked for a female physician the ordinance required that one be provided. The court stated that it was not passing on whether or not there was a reasonable basis to believe that the women were infected; however, the court ruled that the women were entitled to be released because it was not proper to hold them to force them to submit to examination. In addition, 22 days was an unreasonable length of time to hold people in a city jail without trial and without opportunity to be released on bond.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The license applicant appealed from an adverse judgment in a mandamus action in which she sought to compel the city, the mayor, the council, and the city clerk to issue a cereal malt beverage license. The city did not contend that the application for a license was inadequate in form or failed to supply the required information or that the facts stated therein disqualified the applicant. The city argued that the application which merely contained the information required by statute did not compel the issuance of a license. The applicant argued if an application contained the facts required by statute, and the application showed that he was not a person who was disqualified, and the location of the business was not in a prohibited zone, the applicant was entitled to the license as a matter of right. The court held that mandamus was not proper because the law required the issuance of a license only after the city approved the application, and the application was not approved. The court held that he action to compel the issuance of the writ was premature. The court noted that all the applicant had was the right to ask the city to grant her a privilege.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 44-504 (1945 Supp.).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a petition alleging that she was the widow of the decedent and the mother of his minor daughter, that through defendants' negligence a truck operated by defendants collided with a bus driven by the decedent, and that decedent died from injuries received in the collision. Defendants submitted an affidavit of the workmen's compensation commissioner showing that an award had been made in favor of plaintiff and the daughter against the decedent's employer and its insurer. The trial court sustained defendants' motion to dismiss on the ground that plaintiff was maintaining the action for and on behalf of herself and that she was barred by the 18-month statute of limitations under &sect; 44-504. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected plaintiff's argument that the issue of who was the real plaintiff could only be raised by answer. It noted that plaintiff successfully resisted defendant's efforts to learn who actually was the plaintiff. The court also rejected her argument that a 1947 amendment to &sect; 44-504 was retroactive. Plaintiff's constitutional rights were not violated by the requirement that she bring her action against a third person within 18 months.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent's will came before the probate judge for probate. There was a question regarding the decedent's testamentary capacity and because the probate judge was a witness regarding that capacity, a judge pro tem was appointed to determine testamentary capacity. The judge pro tem determined that the decedent was competent at the time his will was executed, that the will should be submitted for probate, and that the applicant should be appointed executor of the will. The probate judge refused to adopt any of the findings by the judge pro tem, other than the determination regarding the decedent's testamentary capacity. On the applicant's petition, the court held that the probate judge was an interested party to the determination of whether the decedent possessed testamentary capacity, which barred his participation in that particular matter as a judge. The court found, however, that the determination of who should be appointed executor of the decedent's estate was a separate action from the testamentary capacity question. The court ruled that the probate judge was entitled to resume his authority on the matter after the judge pro tem determined to admit the will for probate.</SPAN></P>

The farmer sought to obtain personal jurisdiction over the nonresident motorist under Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 8-401-8-402 (1935), which provided for suits and service of process against nonresidents in cases arising out of the operation of their motor vehicles within the state. The trial court agreed with the nonresident motorist that the statutes did not apply because the accident occurred on a farm and not on a state highway. The court rejected the farmer's argument that the nonresident motorist waived the jurisdictional issue by filing his motion to quash. The court determined that the motion only relied on those facts in the farmer's petition that were necessary to frame the jurisdictional question. The court interpreted Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-401 (1935) and concluded that it was intended to apply only to accidents that occurred on state highways. Because this alleged accident occurred on private property, &sect; 8-401 did not provide personal jurisdiction over the nonresident motorist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original proceeding in mandamus, plaintiff city sought to compel defendant, the Auditor of the State of Kansas, to register certain sewer bonds. The question presented on appeal was whether the statute under which the city issued the bonds, Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 13-1018l (Supp. 1939), had been repealed by a clause contained in a subsequent act, 1941 Kan. Sess. Laws 122, amending Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 13-1018l.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed an ordinance authorizing issuance of general improvement bonds to fund the construction of certain city sewers and public facilities. The bonds recited Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 10-101 to 10-115 (1935) and Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 13-1018l (Supp. 1939) as the authority for their issuance. Section 13-1018l was later amended by 1941 Kan. Sess. Laws 122, &sect; 11, verbatim, adding only a proviso. 1941 Kan. Sess. Laws 122, &sect; 13 was a repealing clause that attempted to repeal the statutes being amended. The court held that the city was entitled to mandamus relief. Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 13-1018l, as amended by 1941 Kan. Sess. Laws 122, &sect; 11, was invalid because it violated Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 17. Where an act expressly repealing another act and provided a substitute therefor was deemed invalid, the repealing clause had to fall as well unless the legislature intended the repealing clause to remain in effect notwithstanding the invalidity of the remainder of the statute. The fact that Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 13-1018l was reenacted verbatim was a clear indication that this was not the legislative intent. Thus, the repealing clause was invalid, leaving the original &sect; 13-1018l in force.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, released sex offender, challenged denial of his motions to rescind registration requirements under the Kansas Offender Registration Act (KORA), Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-4901 et seq., or to prohibit disclosure of registration information on the internet, arguing release of the information on the internet violated his constitutional right to privacy. The court found a plain reading of KORA in conjunction with the Open Records Act (ORA), Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 45-215 et seq., indicated legislative intent to provide public access to registration information when an offender fell within the KORA. Moreover, disclosures on the internet were allowed because the internet provided a medium that met all of the criteria required under the ORA, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 45-220(a). Finally, since individuals had no protected privacy interests in arrest and conviction records, defendant's right to privacy was not implicated and the statute was rationally related to a legitimate state purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot and killed a police officer during a drug raid at his home. He was acquitted of all charges related to the shooting based on a defense of dwelling argument. However, he was convicted of various drug charges and one count of aggravated assault. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the drug evidence obtained from the search of his residence. The court held that the initial affidavit was invalid due to deliberate attempts to mislead the magistrate. The initial search warrant was unconstitutionally executed in violation of defendant's Fourth Amendment right to be protected from unreasonable search and seizures. However, the court held that the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine did not apply to require suppression of evidence obtained under the subsequent warrants. The court made this determination based on the fact that the police incorporated the initial affidavit into the subsequent search warrants and did not rely on additional information received during the unconstitutional search to establish probable cause regarding defendant's drug activity. Defendant's convictions were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants began picketing and threatening to picket the advertisers of appellee following appellant wife's lawsuit that alleged appellee had violated the terms of her employment contract. The trial court granted appellee a permanent injunction, thereby enjoining appellants from conducting such activities. On appeal, the questions were whether appellants' U.S. Const. amend. I rights were violated, whether the injunction was an unconstitutional prior restraint, and whether the injunction was an appropriate remedy. The court affirmed, holding that Kansas law prohibited appellants from picketing beyond the area within which a labor dispute arose. As such, appellants' activities of &quot;secondary picketing&quot; were not necessarily protected by U.S. Const. amend. I, because substantial evidence supported the lower court's findings that appellants' picketing was motivated by a labor dispute rather than political concerns over the treatment of women. Moreover, an injunction was the appropriate remedy, as there was a threat of injury.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 21-3437.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with intentional mistreatment of a dependent adult, in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3437(a)(1), for mistreating his mother. The state filed an interlocutory appeal of the trial court's order granting defendant's motion in limine to exclude evidence of physical injuries sustained by the victim. The statute prohibited infliction of physical injury, unreasonable confinement, or cruel punishment. The court remanded, holding that the trial court's order was ambiguous and required clarification of the evidence excluded. It ruled that the statute was not a prohibition against three separate and distinct offenses, but that they could overlap, and that evidence that defendant slapped his mother could support a charge of physical injury or cruel punishment. The definition of &quot;physical injury&quot; was the same as that of &quot;bodily harm,&quot; which included any touching of the victim against his or her will, with physical force, in an intentional, hostile, and aggravated manner, and required a finding of substantial pain or an impairment of physical condition. &quot;Cruel punishment&quot; was defined as severe treatment, considering the victim's age, and physical and mental condition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded an order granting defendant's motion in limine to exclude evidence of physical injury suffered by his mother in defendant's prosecution for the intentional infliction of cruel punishment upon a dependent in order to clarify what evidence was to be excluded, because the trial court's order was ambiguous and the motion was not specific. The court held that evidence of slapping or other physical conduct was admissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for the mistreatment of a dependant adult, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3437, was affirmed. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute, the sufficiency of the evidence, and the denial of defendant's request for a bill of particulars. The court determined that the statute was readily understandable by persons of common intelligence. The court held that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3437 was not unconstitutionally vague. The court reviewed the denial of the bill of particulars requested by defendant. The bill of particulars was not necessary because defendant had access to all of the evidence of the state of Kansas. Further, a specific time was not required because the offense had occurred in an approximation over a two-year period. Because the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction, the court affirmed the holding that defendant had mistreated a dependent adult. The cross-appeal made by the state was dismissed because the Kansas Supreme Court was the proper court for jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the order from the trial court that refused to suppress evidence, which was found in plain view of officers who were in the residence to execute a writ of assistance. The evidence was seized under the search warrant and defendant was convicted for the cultivation of marijuana, possession of cocaine, no drug tax stamp, possession of drug paraphernalia, and possession of marijuana. Defendant argued that the writ of assistance was defective and that the seizure of any items of evidence from the house under the search warrant should be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree. On appeal, the court held that defendant's Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV, rights were not violated. The fact that defendant was not given notice of and a hearing on the question of whether a writ of assistance should be issued did not render the writ of assistance null and void or improper in any way. The court also held that any seizures made as a result of the entry into the home under the writ of assistance were not unreasonable as a matter of law and did not violate the Fourth Amendment rights of the possessor of that property. Thus, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Appellee established that the complainant was a member of a protected class, she sought to rent and was qualified to rent the apartment, she was denied rental of the apartment, and the apartment was subsequently rented to a white family. Appellant's reasons for not renting to the complainant were pretextual.

The district court failed to consider the defendant's federal convictions as part of the criminal history. They were scoreable offenses, as they, contrary to defendant's allegations, did not involved a continuing course of conduct. The offenses involved different actions in different dates. As to the jail time credit issue, defendant was only entitled to credit for time he served while in custody for the charges which he was currently being sentenced.

The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father challenged judgment against him, contending (1) the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the action; (2) the district court erred in determining that his second motion for a new trial was untimely; (3) the recoupment statute violated the Supremacy Clause of Article VI of the United States Constitution; (4) the statute of limitations barred part of the SRS claim for reimbursement; and (5) application of the recoupment statute denied him due process and equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The appellate court disagreed, addressing only the jurisdictional issue as dispositive. The notice of appeal was not timely to preserve issues of trial error or the overruling of the father's first motion for a new trial. However, the court did have jurisdiction under Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was a serious disciplinary problem in prison. As a result of his conviction for several administrative offenses in prison, 13 months of good time credits were withheld from him. The inmate alleged that the regulatory scheme concerning earning, withholding, and forfeiting good time credits was an ex post facto law as applied to the inmate. He argued that since he committed his crime prior to the effective date of the regulations, those regulations could have not adversely affected him. The regulation in effect at the time the inmate was convicted entitled the inmate to automatic good time credits. The court determined that application of regulations passed after the inmate's initial conviction, which was retrospective and disadvantaged the inmate, violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, U.S. Const., art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer found and seized 86 marijuana plants growing on defendants' property.

On appeal, the court held that Kansas laws barring marijuana cultivation were clearly valid despite incidental burdens they placed on the practice of some religions. The court rejected defendants' comparison to a state law allowing the religious use of peyote because religious use of peyote was infrequent, was practiced by culturally and politically discrete Native American groups, and peyote was not abused at the same rate as marijuana.

It was licensed to sell alcoholic beverages by the drink and featured totally nude dancing as entertainment. The city, concerned about a rush of new adult entertainment operations, passed an ordinance regulating the services and entertainment offered by the lounge and prohibiting totally nude dancing and certain other activities. At the present time, the lounge was the only business affected by the ordinance. The lounge filed a declaratory judgment action, seeking to have the constitutionality of the ordinance determined. The trial court found the ordinance to be constitutional in all respects, and the lounge appealed. The court held that (1) the lounge had standing to challenge the ordinance; (2) the state had not preempted the issues of nude dancing and the city had the right to regulate it; (3) the action of the city was supported by evidence of secondary effects from establishments which sold liquor and allow totally nude dancing; and (4) several sections of the ordinance, including those covering movies and magazines, were overbroad and therefore, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision that found the ordinance completely constitutional and the court held that certain provisions of the ordinance were overbroad and, therefore, unconstitutional. The court affirmed the rest of the trial court's decision and held that the balance of the ordinance was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The employee cross-appealed, claiming that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-501(h) was unconstitutional. The court affirmed. Since the employee did not offer the opinion of a physician regarding her task loss, she did not meet her burden of proof. The employee would have continued to work if she had not been terminated. The record reflected that she applied for retirement benefits subsequent to her termination because she needed health insurance. Even after she had applied for retirement benefits, the employee sought employment. The employee did not refuse employment; it was never offered to her. The court affirmed the Board's findings that the employee sustained a 100 percent wage loss, which when averaged with her 0 percent task loss, resulted in a 50 percent work disability to be reduced by her retirement income.

Defendant contended the retroactivity provision of the Kansas Sentencing Guidelines Act (KSGA) at Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4724 violated various provisions of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The KSGA was partially retroactive, but its provisions could never have lengthened a defendant's sentence or enhanced punishment. As such, the KSGA was not an ex post facto law. Defendant contended that the KGSA empowered the Department of Corrections to act as the judiciary in determining what crime was committed, how severe the crime was based on limited guidelines, and what an individual's criminal history consisted of, and thus violated the separation of powers doctrine. The court held that such limited delegation did violate separation of powers. The court held that the sentencing court violated Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3424(4) (1981) by failing to allow allocution. Defendant, however, filed a motion to modify his sentence in which he alleged multiple reasons for modification, but did not raise the allocution claim. A hearing was held where defendant was represented by counsel. Failure to raise allocution in that motion waived defendant's ability to claim denial of allocution in a later appeal.</SPAN></P>

The father claimed a due process violation because in order to preserve parental rights, the father had been required to support the mother prior to birth even though paternity had been in question. Upon review, the court held that &sect; 59-2136 did not violate due process because it provided a father with notice and opportunity to be heard and required clear and convincing proof. Moreover, the court rejected the contention that due process had been violated because the father had been required to support the mother when paternity was in doubt. In rejecting this contention, the court held that where parental rights were purely biological and there was no family, bonding, support, or love, these rights were less deserving of support. Moreover, in rejecting the contention that &sect; 59-2136 contemplated only one father, the court held that &sect; 59-2136 did not require a father to undoubtedly know that he was a child's biological father.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Shawnee District Court (Kansas), which convicted him of aggravated sexual battery on a plea of no contest and required him to register as a sex offender under the Kansas Sex Offender Registration Act (KSORA), Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-4901, et seq. Defendant contended that the KSORA was violative of double jeopardy and, as applied to him, constituted cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled no contest to attempted aggravated sexual battery. The evidence indicated that he was intoxicated when he impulsively committed a serious violent crime against the victim. There was no evidence to support a reasonable inference that he was a repeat sex offender posing a danger to the community. There was no indication that he had a mental illness or personality disorder that would suggest he would re-offend. The court reversed the trial court's judgment to the extent that defendant's sex offender registration was required to be open to public inspection or subject to disclosure under the Kansas Open Records Act. Defendant was being required to register as a sex offender solely because of the crime he committed, with no risk assessment whatsoever. His minimal sentence of 14 months with presumptive probation was incongruous with the requirement that he register as a sex offender for 10 years. The court concluded that the unlimited disclosure of defendant's registration under the KSORA constituted cruel and unusual punishment as applied to defendant, which was forbidden by the Eighth Amendment and Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of several crimes, including possession of cocaine. Defendant appealed from a decision of the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas), which denied his motion to convert his sentence, ostensibly filed pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4724(d)(1). The trial court summarily dismissed defendant's motion for lack of jurisdiction because it was not timely filed after the issuance of a sentencing guidelines report.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court erred in summarily denying defendant's motion. Therefore, the court considered the basis for the motion. Between the time defendant committed his crimes and the time he was sentenced, the Kansas Sentencing Guidelines Act (KSGA) was amended. Defendant contended that he was subjected to an illegal sentence because the prospective imposition of the amendments to the KSGA violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and &sect; 1 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights. Defendant argued that under an equal protection analysis the amendments should have been given retroactive application. The court held that equal protection did not entitle defendant to retroactive application of the amendments. The State had an interest in maintaining stability in the sentencing process and a concomitant obligation to improve the criminal justice system. The rule that the criminal statute in effect at the time the crime was committed was the penalty to be imposed served those legitimate governmental interests and did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or &sect; 1 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the record on appeal did not contain substantial competent evidence to support appellee's actions regarding the Kansas universal service fund as required under Kan. Stat.

The applicant cross-appealed the Board's refusal to include certain benefits in the computation of her weekly wage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant injured her back in the course of her employment. Part of the applicant's disability was attributable to prior injuries. The applicant was offered a different position, but she refused it. The ALJ determined that the Fund was liable for the applicant's pre-existing injury. The ALJ also determined that the employer was entitled to an offset under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-501(h) for early retirement benefits. The Fund and the employer appealed. The Board reversed the determination that the Fund was liable and recalculated the benefits awarded. On appeal, the court held that the evidence supported the finding that the applicant was not precluded from benefits because the different position was not comparable. The court affirmed the Board's calculation of the benefits. The Board properly held that the Fund was not liable because the employer failed to establish that the applicant was a handicapped employee under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-567. The court rejected the applicant's argument that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-501(h) violated her equal protection and due process rights. The applicant's vacation and sick leave did not constitute remuneration under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-511(a)(2).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission found that the company did not incur or acquire the market entry costs of certain entities, upon which the original rates were based in part. The company argued that the Commission erred in not reopening the record and that, in any event, there was substantial competent evidence in the record that the company did acquire the market entry costs in question. The court affirmed. There was no abuse of discretion in not reopening the record because there was no allegation of additional evidence that was unavailable at the time of the hearing. There was no ground for reversing the Commission's decision that the company failed to carry its burden of proving entitlement to a rate increase. The finding that the company did not acquire the market entry costs in question was support by substantial competent evidence. The transfer of a certificate of convenience and necessity did not carry the entities' assets with it. The order of refund was correct. The company carried the risk of refund upon judicial review of the rate increase. The company's due process rights were not impaired by the refusal to reopen the record in light of the extensive record developed at the hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pinned the victim against a bar and swore racial obscenities at her. Defendant acknowledged that he was a &quot;skinhead.&quot; He contended that the city's ethnic intimidation ordinance was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague, and also violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court found that the city's ethnic intimidation ordinance, Wichita City, Kan., Code &sect; 5.01.010, was not aimed at regulating speech, but rather was intended to penalize conduct undertaken by reason of a specific motivation or intent. Thus, the ordinance was not a content-based regulation of free speech. The court held that the ethnic intimidation ordinance was rationally related to a valid legislative objective through its punishment and deterrence of bias-motivated crimes. Accordingly, the ordinance did not violate the equal protection clause. The court did reverse the battery and disorderly conduct convictions because the evidence adduced at trial for the purpose of proving ethnic intimidation as charged also necessarily proved battery and disorderly conduct, the latter were included offenses, and the convictions were multiplicitous under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3107(2)(d).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee injured his arm when he sustained an electrical shock in the course and scope of his employment. He did not miss any work, nor did he suffer any loss of wages because of his injury. An administrative law judge found the employee eligible for permanent partial disability benefits, and the Board agreed. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-501(c) (Supp. 1996) could not be applied retroactively for the employee's benefit. The version of &sect; 44-501(c) in effect at the time of the injury provided that, except for medical compensation, an employer was not liable under the Workers Compensation Act for any injury that did not disable the employee for a period of at least one week from earning full wages. Although the legislature indicated that the amendment to &sect; 44-501(c), which eliminated the one week requirement, should be applied retroactively, the court determined that to do so would unconstitutionally impair the employer's due process right to have the substantive law in effect at the time of the injury applied to the employee's compensation benefit determination. Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-501(c) (Supp. 1996) could only be applied prospectively.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was found guilty of driving while a habitual violator. On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendant contended that the Kansas habitual violator statutes violated her due process rights because such statutes provided for notice of the declaration of habitual violator status by regular mail and not by restricted mail. The court held that the Kansas Department of Revenue's action in mailing the notice of suspension to defendant at her last known address by regular mail comported with the minimum requirements of due process. While sending notices by regular mail was not a guarantee that each and every licensee was to receive notice, the method was reasonably calculated to provide sufficient notice. Further, &sect; 287 did not require that the licensee have actual knowledge of the notice declaring her a habitual violator to sustain a conviction.</SPAN></P>

The lower court affirmed the suspension. Upon appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that while the principal did not specifically state which code the student had violated, he did not impliedly acquit the student of engaging in unruly conduct that disrupts school. The school board did not act beyond its authority or beyond the scope of its review in hearing evidence on whether the student's conduct disrupted school or impinged on the rights of others. The court found that given the school's need to be able to impose disciplinary sanctions for a wide range of unanticipated conduct disruptive of the educational process, the school disciplinary rules were not required to have been as detailed as a criminal code. The court held that the student's conduct had impinged upon or invaded the rights of parents and students to feel safe in their school environment and that evidence alone was sufficient to support the extended suspension.</SPAN></P>

The district court found that the taxpayer failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. On appeal the court first held that the taxpayer's estoppel claim was invalid as a matter of law. It also ruled that the taxpayer did not prove he paid the taxes and, therefore, could not successfully claim an unconstitutional application of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-173. The court rejected the taxpayer's contentions that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-2101 (1996 Supp.) violated the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause. Affirming, the court concluded that qualified immunity shielded the county and its employees from the taxpayer's federal claims. To escape the defense of qualified immunity, the taxpayer had to allege that the county and its employees violated clearly established law. He had challenged the constitutionality of the statutes but did not allege the county or its employees violated them.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied his motion to depart and imposed a presumptive sentence under the Kansas Sentencing Guidelines Act. Defendant appealed and the court affirmed. Defendant claimed that he was prejudiced when the trial court held a joint hearing on his sentencing and his motion for departure. The court found that defendant's counsel consented and that while the language of K.S.A. 21-4718(a)(1) (Kansas) required a hearing to be held on every motion to depart, the statute was silent as to whether the hearing could be combined with the sentencing hearing. The trial court was cognizant of its authority to depart but there was no substantial and compelling reason to override the presumptive sentence. There was no merit in defendant's claim that the trial court's knowledge and consideration of his criminal history resulted in prejudice because defendant failed to assert that the trial court was presented with a substantial and compelling reason to depart. The court found it could not consider defendant's due process claim because it was raised for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the owner's property was rezoned from residential to residential urban, its value drastically increased. In determining the property's value for taxation purposes, the county's appraiser created a valuation of the property based on its unique qualities; in doing so, the appraiser set a per foot value that was between the value placed on commercial and other residential property in the area. The state board reversed the county's appraisal. In reversing the state board and reinstating the county's appraisal, the district court determined that the appraiser properly decreased the property's fair market value by the amount it would have taken to convert the property to useable commercial property. In reversing the judgment in part on appeal, the court held that the state board's reasons for reversing the appraisal were arbitrary and capricious because they were contrary to state law. The appraiser properly determined the fair market value of the property through appropriate, statutorily mandated procedures. The court affirmed the judgment in part with regard to particular errors that the county made in computing the costs to prepare the property for commercial use.</SPAN></P>

A doctor diagnosed her as having carpal tunnel syndrome in her right arm. The claimant underwent surgery and returned to her job. She used the mouse with her left hand. She was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome in her left arm. The claimant stopped working. Doctors found that she had a five percent impairment of her left arm, and a 7.7 percent impairment of her right arm. The Board held that the conditions were separate scheduled injuries. The court affirmed the decision. The injuries were two scheduled injuries rather than a general disability when the claimant's right arm was not aggravated at the same time as her left arm. The secondary liability principle did not apply because the disability to her left arm stemmed from a different injury than the disability to her right arm. The award for two scheduled injuries did not implicate equal protection issues because cases that were not similar were treated dissimilarly. In addition, the claimant failed to raise that constitutional argument in the level below.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the car in which defendant and the victim were traveling crashed into a pole, the victim pointed a gun at defendant. Defendant, fearing that he was about to be shot, pulled out his own gun, closed his eyes, and began shooting. The victim died the next day from a gunshot wound. The trial court denied defense counsel's request for an instruction on involuntary manslaughter. The jury subsequently found defendant guilty of unintentional second-degree murder. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that: (1) the phrase &quot;extreme indifference to the value of human life&quot; was easily understood, and, hence, the depraved heart murder statute,&nbsp;&sect; 21-3402(b), was not unconstitutionally void for vagueness; and (2) the distinction between depraved heart murder and involuntary manslaughter occurred in the degree of recklessness, not in the direction of the violence. The court also held, however, that the jury could have found that the victim, not defendant, was the initial aggressor. The evidence presented supported the giving of an instruction on involuntary manslaughter, and the trial court's failure to give this instruction constituted reversible error.</SPAN></P>

A presentence investigation report revealed that defendant's criminal history score removed him from the presumptive probation block of the sentencing guidelines grid. Defendant filed a motion to withdraw his plea, arguing that he had pled guilty because he believed he had a chance of getting probation. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant argued that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea because the State and defense counsel believed that his criminal history contained only one person felony when it actually contained two person felonies. The court observed that under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4707(c)(4), any prior convictions discovered after a plea had been accepted were to be counted in a defendant's criminal history. Defendant did not stipulate to a specific sentence or to a certain criminal history, nor could he. He agreed to plead guilty in exchange for a robbery charge being reduced to attempted robbery and a forgery charge being dismissed, and the State did not breach the agreement.</SPAN></P>

He showed neither that there were others who were similarly situated as him nor that he was intentionally and purposefully singled out for prosecution on the basis of an arbitrary criterion. The court stated that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3824, under which defendant was charged, was not void for vagueness. The court found that the statute apprised the public of the prohibited activity when measured by common understanding and practice and that persons of common intelligence were not required to guess at the statute's meaning. The court determined that the statute was not overly broad either. The statute only prohibited the act of representing oneself as licensed to practice law when one was not so licensed. The court concluded that defendant's representation that he was a licensed practicing attorney was clearly false and that the statute did not prohibit or curtail any constitutionally protected act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company acquired title to some real estate, which it deeded to the city for 23 years to be used as a race track. In consideration of its interest in the real estate, the city issued bonds. The bond proceeds were used to improve the land transferred to the city. The company operated and managed the facility. The city applied for a property tax exemption for the race track. The Board of Tax Appeals determined that the race track qualified for a tax exemption. The Board concluded that part of the property was exempt as of one date, and the balance was entitled to an exemption at a later date. The trial court affirmed the tax exemption but concluded that all of the property became exempt on the same date. Appellant sought review. The court determined that the city was entitled to a tax exemption because under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-201a,2, the race track was owned by the city, was operated under contract to the city, was used for a governmental function, and bonds were issued to finance it. However, the court reversed the trial court's determination of a single effective date for the exemption and affirmed the trial court's tiered approach to granting the exemption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board filed an action against the crop duster pursuant to the Kansas Pesticide Law. The Board hearing officer found him in violation of the Act under each count of the complaint, assessed fines, and ordered denial of his business license and revocation of the applicator certificate. The crop duster appealed. The district court denied the Board's motion for change of venue, found that the crop duster's petition was sufficient, dismissed part of the complaint, reduced the fines, and reversed the denial of the license and revocation of the certificate. On appeal, the court affirmed the district court's decision on venue based on the amendment to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-609(b) to include a county where the Board's order was effective. The appeal petition and the crop duster's assertions at the hearings provided the Board with notice of the issues and were sufficient. The court reversed the district court's reduction of fines and reversal of the license and certification decisions because there was sufficient evidence on the record before the hearing officer to support his decision and the courts were limited to a substantial evidence review pursuant to the Kansas Judicial Review Act.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court's decision to terminate their parental rights was supported by substantial competent evidence. In so holding, the court found that: (1) Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-1585 was constitutionally applied in the parents' case, because although there was a substantial lapse of time between the prior findings of unfitness and the present termination of the parents' rights, the lapse was not as great as in other cases, and the record showed contact between SRS, the trial court, and the parents during much of the intervening period; (2) because the trial court applied &sect; 38-1585 and shifted the burden of proof to the parents, the issue at the trial court level was whether the parents presented enough evidence to rebut the presumption of unfitness; and (3) the introduction of a proposed plan to reintegrate the children into the parents' home, which was never implemented, did not show that the parents were fit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, a home builders association, developers, and private landowners, brought an action to declare ordinances that imposed an excise tax on applicants for plat approval and recordation unconstitutional and in violation of state law. Appellant city sought review of a partial summary judgment from the Johnson District Court (Kansas), which found that the ordinances exceeded the scope of the city's constitutional home rule authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted the ordinances after its prior policy for financing street improvements was ruled unlawful. Overland Park, Kan., Charter Ordinance 64 exempted the city from Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-194 and was enacted to provide alternate home rule authority for the excise tax. The regular ordinances repealed the prior policy and levied the excise tax. Reversing the partial summary judgment, the court held that &sect; 12-194 did not bar an excise tax levied by Overland Park, Kan., Ordinance EX-1880 on the privilege of engaging in the business of platting real property because recording a plat did not give rise to any particular use of the property and because the tax, which was levied on each plat as it was recorded, was not imposed on a transactional basis. The court ruled that the city had the power to exempt itself from Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-194 under Kan. Const. art. 12, &sect; 5(c)(1) because Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-194 was part of the local retailers' sales tax enactment, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-187 et seq., and that enactment was nonuniform. The court found that the tax was imposed in addition to the filing fee under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28-115 and did not violate due process or equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the partial summary judgment and remanded for further proceedings on the remaining counts of appellees' second amended petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the proposed ordinance related to the rights of individuals to possess and obtain firearms. In determining whether a repealing ordinance was administrative of legislative, it was necessary to look to the ordinance(s) that would be repealed. The proposed ordinance repealed existing ordinances and sought to restrict the adoption of new ordinances. The court stated that when a proposed ordinance repealed an existing ordinance, the proposed ordinance had to identify each ordinance that would be repealed.The proposed ordinance reflected a policy of freeing firearms from restrictions, which included zoning. The repealing effects of the proposed ordinance would interfere with the comprehensive zoning plans of the city and, as such, the proposed ordinance was administrative.The proposed ordinance would destroy many of the city's administrative regulations involving zoning, the airport, sales, advertising, and others. The effect of the proposed ordinance on the administrative scheme of the city could not be ignored. Therefore, the proposed ordinance was administrative and was not subject to initiative and referendum.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Although the licensee claimed to have problems understanding English, he failed to request an interpreter for the administrative hearing. On appeal, he argued that the trial court inappropriately granted summary judgment because genuine issues of material fact still existed. Additionally, the licensee argued that &sect; 8-1001 was unconstitutional because it violated his right to due process of law. The court held that: (1) despite the trial court's de novo review of the administrative hearing, the licensee's appeal was limited to those issues presented at the hearing; (2) because the licensee did not present issues of a denial of the effective assistance of counsel and a failure to furnish an interpreter, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to address these issues and the court lacked appellate jurisdiction; and (3) the failure to understand the warnings was not a defense and did not render the results of any tests inadmissible.</SPAN></P>

The insurer, in consideration of the physician's paid premium, was required to assume the responsibility to defend any claim, which was covered by the policy. The insurer was not obligated to defend any action after the extent of its liability had been exhausted by payment of judgment or settlement. The policy did not give the insurer the right to settle without the physician's consent. The policy did not specifically require that the insurer give his consent to any settlement. The court held that the language of the contract was ambiguous and should be interpreted in favor of the physician. The policy did not say whether the insurer had the exclusive right to settle and had to be interpreted to mean that the insured could not settle for less that the policy limits without the physician's consent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant purchased cocaine from a police informant. He was arrested and charged with several crimes, including violation of &sect; 65-4127a. At his jury trial, he was convicted of all offenses. On appeal, he argued that &sect; 65-4127a(d) was unconstitutionally vague as to the proscribed conduct. He further contended that the trial court erred in its modification of the verdict form upon which he was found guilty. The court held that &sect; 65-4127a(d) was only subject to one construction that was reasonable. It was intended to provide enhanced punishment for offenders who committed certain acts prohibited under &sect; 65-4127a(b) if committed within 1,000 feet of school property. The court held that any other construction ignored consideration of the harm to be prevented: drug dealing within the protected school zone. Accordingly, the court held that &sect; 65-4127a(d) was neither vague nor ambiguous. The court agreed with the district court's interpretation of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father's parental rights were terminated because he had failed to support the mother during her pregnancy and because he was an unfit father. On appeal, the court affirmed. The father claimed that he had no way of knowing that Kan. Stat.

The father was in another state; the mother left that state and had the baby in the forum state. The court held that because the forum state had more interests in the matter, the baby was born and adopted in the state, its law would apply. The court noted that the father was aware that the mother was in the forum state because his father had hired an agency to locate the mother. The court rejected the father's claim that he had reasonable cause to not support the mother because his attorney told him he did not have to. However, the court noted that the father misinterpreted the attorney's advice. Finally, the court affirmed the finding that the father was an unfit parent because he didn't support the child, and was only concerned about his relationship with the mother, not the child.</SPAN></P>

The taxes were owed by a liquor establishment for which the taxpayer served as a corporate officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the taxpayer argued that she was entitled to attorney's fees because the KDR's proposed course of action, which the district court found to be unconstitutional, was unreasonable as a matter of law and that the district court applied an improper legal standard in denying her request under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3268(f). The court found that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-2971 (Supp. 1995) imposed personal liability on the taxpayer and directly referenced the Liquor Drink Tax Act, which referenced the Kansas Retailers' Sales Tax Act, which authorized the issuance of tax warrants against &quot;any taxpayer&quot; liable to the KDR under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3617 (Supp. 1995). The court held that it could not be said that the claim asserted by the KDR was without a reasonable basis in law or fact. The court rejected the taxpayer's argument that the district court abused its discretion in denying her request for attorney's fees. The court found that the use of the word &quot;may,&quot; as applied by the legislature in Kan. Stat.

Defendant was found guilty by the jury and convicted. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the admission of defendant's prior drug sales did not violate Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-455. The challenged testimony from a buyer buttressed his identification of defendant and was probative of defendant's intent. Also, the evidence was admissible independent of &sect; 60-455 because the buyer's testimony about prior drug transactions showed the relationship between defendant and the buyer. The court also found that the trial court properly refused to give an instruction on sale of cocaine as a lesser included offense of sale of cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school. Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers spotted defendant driving with his car stereo blaring, in violation of Topeka, Kan., City Code &sect; 142-191 (1994). Recognizing defendant as an individual who had had his driver's license suspended, police decided to stop him, but defendant sped up, eventually stopping at an auto body repair shop, where he spent several minutes in the restroom. After exiting the restroom, one of the officers arrested defendant, while the other searched the restroom, finding 21 individually wrapped pieces of crack cocaine. On appeal, the court ruled that given defendant's violation of &sect; 142-191 and the officer's knowledge that his license had been suspended, police had probable cause to arrest him. The search of the restroom was permissible both as a search incident to an arrest and because defendant had no expectation of privacy there. Defendant could not obtain reversal due to the State's untimely endorsement of a witness because he failed to request a continuance when the witness was called. The Supreme Court of Kansas had upheld the constitutionality of the Kansas Drug Tax Stamp Act, &sect;&sect; 79-5201 et seq.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was a greenhouse operation which grew plants for decorative purposes. Its produce was sold through grocery stores and other mass marketers. The Department issued a retailers' sales tax and consumers compensating use tax assessment against the taxpayer. The narrow question presented was whether the taxpayer's wholesale greenhouse operation constituted an agricultural use, or farming, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3606. The court concluded the Department's governing regulation, Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-39, was significantly more restrictive in the definition of agricultural use or farming than was contemplated by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3606 and common definition. As such, the regulation was invalid to the extent it defined agricultural use and farming in a more restrictive sense than the statutes. Using the common meaning of agricultural use and the definition provided by &sect; 79-1476, the terms agricultural use and farming were intended to include operations such as the taxpayer's. Accordingly, the taxpayer was entitled to relief as the Department acted beyond the jurisdiction conferred upon it by law, and its action was unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for criminal nonsupport of a child after the trial court granted the State's motion in limine preventing defendant from presenting evidence of the child's trust fund that was used for the child's support. Defendant appealed, claiming the trial court improperly refused to allow his evidence that the child was not in necessitous circumstances and that he made contributions to the trust. The court found there was little doubt that the child had independent means through the trust. The trial court's ruling was based on the child's mother's testimony that defendant did not pay his court-ordered support. The court found, while that was skimpy evidence, it might be sufficient for a conviction if nothing more were required. However, the ruling on the motion in limine denied defendant the opportunity to refute that testimony. Moreover, there was simply no evidence to show that the child was in necessitous circumstances, which was an essential element of the crime. The motion in limine should have been denied. Finally, the jury instruction relieved the jury from finding that the essential element of necessitous circumstances be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3704. In affirming the judgment the court first determined the extent of the exemption, which as pertinent was limited to tangible personal property brought into the state by a common carrier for movement in interstate commerce. The court considered &quot;movement&quot; in the context of &quot;rolling stock,&quot; as that term appeared in Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-20-18. In the railroad context rolling stock meant locomotives and cars. It did not include forklifts and other items, the movement of which was incidental to unloading and loading of cars. This definition thus excluded the equipment for which the taxpayer sought the exemption. Regs. 92-20-18 was not so limited in scope as to conflict with Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3704(a) (1994 Supp.). Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3703 (1994 Supp.) passed the four-part test for determining the constitutionality of a tax under the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

Because it was not necessary for defendant's counsel to have informed defendant of the collateral consequences of his plea, it followed that counsel was not required to anticipate changes in the law in order to advise defendant of some potential future consequence of the plea. The court also rejected defendant argument that the change in the law that redesignated the burglaries as person felonies was an unconstitutional ex post facto law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a federal estate tax return was filed and the GSTT exemption was ratably allocated among the remaindermen and specific bequests, the executor sought a determination as to whether the GSTT should be paid from the residue of the estate or whether the tax should be charged against the property that constituted the generation-skipping transfer. The district court determined that the tax should be paid from the residue and remainder, and it denied the residuary taker's motion to reapportion the GSTT exemption to allow them to enjoy the benefit of the exemption. The court affirmed in part, finding that: (1) Kansas public policy regarding the payment of death taxes from the residue was preempted by the express federal mandate of I.R.C. &sect; 2603(b); (2) the tax had to be charged against the generation-skipping transfer against which the tax was imposed unless the will and trust contained a specific reference to the GSTT; (3) the apportionment of the GSTT was not explicitly mentioned in the will or codicil; (4) the specific reference rule did not apply to the allocation of the exemption; and (5) the executor could allocate the GSTT exemption according to the testator's directions.</SPAN></P>

The birth father argued that his payment of approximate one-fourth of the child support due during the two-year period should not have been considered &quot;insubstantial.&quot; The court agreed and reversed the district court's order. The court said that the support payments, coupled with the provision of insurance benefits for the child, were not &quot;insubstantial&quot; efforts.

The court held that because the arson charge and conspiracy charge each required proof of a fact not required in proving the other, the charges were not multiplicitous. The evidence necessary to establish intent to commit arson did not necessarily also prove conspiracy, and the fact that evidence of a conspiracy was also presented at trial did not mean that the convictions were multiplicitous. While the prosecution's closing argument may have improperly characterized defendant as a liar, it did not so prejudice the jury so as to deny defendant a fair trial.

The district court claimed that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-1585(a)(1) (Supp. 1994) created a presumption of unfitness regarding the mother that the mother did not overcome, and the mother claimed that the statute violated her due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother last her parental rights to the first child and to the second child when the State offered evidence that the mother had eight years earlier lost parental rights to a third child. The State presented no other evidence, claiming a presumption of the mother's fitness under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-1585(a)(1) (Supp. 1994). The district court found for the State and the mother appealed. The court reversed the district court and remanded the matter, noting that the first child was never declared to be in need of care, and holding that the mother was denied due process by the presumption of unfitness to care for the second child. The prior adjudication could not constitutionally form the basis of a shift in the burden of proof to the mother, the court said. Parental rights were a liberty interest entitled to protection from unwarranted state action, and the presumption bore a great risk of error and was outweighed by the loss of parental rights, the court concluded. However, the court held that &sect; 38-1585 could have been constitutionally applied if the district court had determined whether the presumption was a Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-414(a) or Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-414(b) presumption.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found for the mother, reversed the district court, and remanded the matter.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A putative father filed an action under Kansas Parentage Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-1110 et seq., seeking judicial determination of the paternity of a minor child born while the child's mother was married to her former husband. The mother and the putative father of the child were married after the mother's first marriage ended in divorce. The trial court denied the putative father's request for the necessary blood tests after determining that it would not be in the best interests of the child for his paternity to be determined. The trial court cited the fact that it believed that certain stable relationships the child had formed might be terminated if the mother was to gain sole custody of the child. On appeal, the putative father alleged that his constitutional rights had been violated by the trial court's decision. The court determined that the putative father did not have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in establishing the child's paternity due to the fact that he failed to establish any relationship with the child until the child was four years old. The court found the trial court did not abuse its discretion by declining to order the necessary blood tests.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction, finding that the evidence was sufficient to establish that the State established a material deviation from the appropriate standard of care. The evidence proved that the victim's vehicle had four-way flashing lights, a large orange sign identifying it as a construction vehicle, amber flashing lights on top of it, and that defendant's semitrailer truck approached with undiminished speed and never took evasive action even though the victim's truck was visible at a distance of one quarter of a mile.

The Sumner District Court (Kansas) held that it had no jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA), Kan. Stat.

The father contended that the UCCJA was inapplicable to an initial determination of child custody under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1610 (Supp. 1993) because the UCCJA was limited to actions for modification of custody. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment. The court held that despite the amendment to &sect; 60-1610, the UCCJA applied to initial custody determinations under &sect; 60-1610, which had to be made in accordance with the best interests of the children. The court further held that it was not in the best interests of the children that custody be determined in Kansas when they had closer connections to Georgia, their home state. Further, jurisdiction could not be based on a &quot;significant connection&quot; with Kansas because this provision only applied when jurisdiction was in the children's best interests.

A certain opinion handed down by the Kansas Supreme Court, which the court found controlling, held that the limited retroactivity portion of the KSGA was constitutional and that the Legislature intended to reduce prison overcrowding while protecting public safety by creating a distinction between more serious and less serious offenders, which was rational and related to a legitimate State interest. The court affirmed, further finding that that the term &quot;serious offenses&quot; included more than violent or dangerous offenses. The court also cited language in the opinion referred to which, in noting that the limited retroactivity provision was not without precedent, stated that serious crimes against persons and drug offenses were generally the same crimes excepted from retroactivity under sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Labette District Court (Kansas) convicting him of forgery pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3710(a)(2) and enhancing his sentence under the Habitual Criminal Act, specifically Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4504(c) (1993 Supp.).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that under &sect; 21-4504(c), an article 34 crime under chapter 21 of Kansas Statutes Annotated could not be used to enhance the article 37 felony for which he was convicted. He also argued that &sect; 21-4504 was unconstitutionally vague. The court overturned the sentence. After a plain reading of the entire statute and a review of the 1989 and 1990 amendments, the court accepted defendant's interpretation of &sect; 21-4504(c) that his prior article 34 crimes should not have been used to enhance his present sentence. Since his current conviction was for a crime other than an article 34, 35, or 36 crime, his sentence could only be enhanced if he had been convicted at least twice before for crimes other than article 34, 35, or 36 crimes. The trial court abused its discretion by enhancing defendant's article 37 conviction using article 34 convictions. Nevertheless, the court rejected defendant's argument that the prior convictions had to be for the same offense or that the prior convictions had to be from the same article. Finally, &sect; 21-4504 was not unconstitutionally vague because it conveyed a definite warning that habitual criminals would be given enhanced sentences.</SPAN></P>

An administrative law judge (ALJ) held that claimant had suffered a 20 percent impairment of the body as a whole as a result of his work-related injuries. When no petition for review was filed, the Workers Compensation Appeals Board approved the order of the ALJ as required by statute. The employee then appealed from the order of the Board and the ALJ.

The date of the employee's injury was not controlling determinative in whether the statute applied.

After finding the documentation proper, the officers asked to see some guns that defendant was carrying in the vehicle. When the officer retrieved the guns, he noticed a small amount of marijuana and a bong. The trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress because the initial stop was illegal. Because defendant was hauling his personal belongings, he was not a motor carrier under Kan. Stat.

Because there were no neutral criteria or guidelines to check the discretion of the officers, the stop was unconstitutional.

The developer's discount method resulted in a systematic valuation of lots owned by the developer within the subdivision at a lower value than those assigned to other lots owned by individuals within the same subdivision. It thus resulted in an inequality of the burden of taxation. Moreover, the developer's discount method was based on ownership and not on the value of each parcel of property as mandated by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-501 (Supp. 1993).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings to value the developer's properties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was killed in the course of employment. The employer through its insurance carrier had paid the workers compensation benefits to the insurance commissioner because there were no dependents entitled to the benefits. The decedent's heirs, who were not the decedent's dependents, had brought a wrongful death action against the employer. The action was barred because of the exclusive remedy provision of the workers compensation act. The heirs had made a constitutional challenge to the exclusive remedy provision on the basis of the equal protection and due process clauses. The trial court had denied the heirs' constitutional challenge, and they filed an appeal. On appeal, the court found that the exclusive remedy provision did not violate the equal protection clause by discriminating between heirs who were dependent versus the heirs who were not dependent on the decedent. The court found a rational and reasonable basis for allowing dependents to receive compensation as a result of a worker's death and for denying benefits to those whom an employee did not support while the employee was living.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department of Corrections (DOC) issued a notification that defendant's drug offense was a severity level 3 conviction and he was therefore ineligible for retroactive application of the Kansas Sentencing Guidelines Act (KSGA), Kan.

The court on appeal found that the KSGA did not provide an avenue by which defendant could challenge the DOC's finding that he was not eligible for retroactive application. However, defendant could have filed an action under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1507 to challenge his exclusion from the retroactivity pool. The trial court should have construed defendant's pleading as a &sect; 60-1507 petition because that statute provided an appropriate remedy. Therefore, the trial court's conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction was erroneous. However, the court affirmed defendant's sentences. Defendant's constitutional challenge to his exclusion from the retroactivity pool was without merit based on existing precedent.

The court held that the water authority failed to provide a reasoned explanation for its amendment to the district's plan. It was inconsistent and patently arbitrary absent some explanation for the water authority to use the guidelines to determine the district's future water requirements and then to reject the guideline recommendations when formulating a usage goal for the district. While the water authority may have had the authority to impose stricter usage goals than required by the guidelines, it was incumbent upon the water authority to provide a reasoned explanation in its decision.

The retailer had the burden of showing that the transaction was exempt from sales tax. The court rejected appellant's argument that the swimming pools he constructed were additions, like rooms and floors. As a matter of common-sense, an in-ground swimming pool was not a room or floor. The court found that the pools in question where land improvements immediately surrounding the buildings, as included in the definition of &quot;building&quot; in Kan. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother asserted that there had not been a material change of circumstances that justified the reduction of the father's child support obligations, that the father's income had been improperly calculated, and that an improper age category was used in the calculation of support for the couples' youngest child. The court reversed the trial court's judgment affirming the AHO's decision and found that there was no adequate record by which it could address the issues on the merits. The court noted that, under Shawnee County, Kan., Family Law Guidelines &sect; 4.05 (1992), stenographic records were not provided in proceedings before the AHO. However, the court also noted that the AHO was required to make findings, and to include with its order any exhibits that had been presented. The court further noted that the trial court, as a court of record, was required under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-252 and Kan. Sup. Ct. R. 165, to state the controlling facts and the legal principles controlling its decision. The court was nevertheless able to ascertain that the improper age category had been used and found, therefore, that such deviation from the guidelines was reversible error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment affirming the AHO's decision to reduce the father's child support obligation. The court remanded the case with directions to the trial court to hold an evidentiary hearing before a district court judge, with a record to be made at no expense to the litigants.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to consecutive terms of life imprisonment for aggravated kidnapping and 30 years to life for each count of rape. Defendant filed a Kan. Stat.

The court held that the trial court was without jurisdiction to convict defendant of the rape of his daughter when he was within the special relationship class of persons who must be charged with aggravated incest.

The owners challenged the valuations and the Board of Tax Appeals concluded the properties were appropriately valued.

The court agreed that if the valuation of the properties in question was not uniform and equal then the assessment was illegal and void. The court found there was no evidence that there was not a uniform and equal rate of assessment and taxation in the county. The court held that although the values were distorted and without relevance insofar as the aggregate total was concerned under the circumstances, the value of the identical office suite was not indicative of a lack of uniformity and equality. The values of the office suites were not indicative of an unequal or intentionally high assessment. They were nothing more than a mathematical anomaly caused by conflicting statutes. The separate values shown may very well have constituted a violation of the provisions of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-412.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customer was injured when he attempted to prime the fuel pump of a lawn mower while the engine was running. The mower was made by the manufacturer in 1966. The customer was injured in 1988. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the manufacturer after concluding that the customer's action was barred by the usual safe life 10-year period of repose. On appeal, the court held that the statute of repose, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-3303(b), could be asserted by the manufacturer even though the issue was raised for the first time on appeal. The court stated that whether the statute barred the action presented a question of law arising out of facts proven or admitted in the trial court. Because only a question of law remained, the manufacturer was not barred from asserting the statute as an affirmative defense. The court found that while the customer should not have been held to a clear and convincing standard of proving that the useful life of the mower had expired, he failed to meet his burden by a preponderance of the evidence. The court stated that none of the customer's assertions provided a basis to conclude that the useful life would exceed 10 years.</SPAN></P>

Appellee Kansas Parole Board later revoked his conditional release. He challenged an order of the Leavenworth District Court (Kansas) that dismissed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that the Board's implementation of a new conditional release policy violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time appellant had committed his crimes, the Board had an unwritten policy for conditions imposed upon release from prison; released individuals could not violate state or federal law. The policy changed after defendant was convicted. The revised policy imposed conditions and requirements as to travel, weapons, narcotics and alcohol use, associating with others engaged in illegal activity, employment, education, and aftercare. In revoking appellant's release, the Board found that appellant had associated with individuals he was prohibited from seeing, failed to follow aftercare recommendations, and failed to abstain from consuming alcoholic beverages. The court upheld the dismissal of appellant's petition. Because it was an issue of first impression in Kansas, the court looked to a California case for guidance in determining if there was an ex post facto violation. Although appellant was disadvantaged by the new policy, the policy revision did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause because the actions for which appellant's conditional release was revoked occurred after the Board had changed its policy. Moreover, the conditions did not apply retrospectively to previous conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was committed to a state hospital after he was found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity. Approximately 16 years after he was committed, petitioner filed a petition under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60.1501 in which he alleged that he was unlawfully confined. Following a hearing, the trial court determined that petitioner was ineligible for release. Upon review, the court reversed and remanded. The court held the trial court erred by refusing to consider conditionally releasing defendant where Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3428a(3)(Supp. 1991) provided discharge could still considered after petitioner was found likely to cause harm to himself or the public, as it could not be said with certainty that no conditions of release would have insured public safety. The court concluded the statutory scheme used to determine the need for continued commitment of insanity acquittees, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 22-3428(3) and 3428a(3)(Supp. 1991) violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the 14th Amendment by not placing the burden of proof upon the State to show by clear and convincing evidence both the committed person's continued insanity and dangerousness.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The painter sustained injuries when he came in contact with a high power line operated by the utility. The injury occurred in Leavenworth County and the painter also lived in that county. The painter filed his action in Wyandotte County, claiming that the utility regularly operated there and the painter had included a property damage claim in his action. The trial court determined that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-606(b) governed the venue of the action and transferred the action to Leavenworth County. The court held that &sect; 60-606(a), which permitted an action against a public utility to be brought in any county in which the utility operated, was a general statute.&nbsp;Section 60-606(b) was a special statute because it governed cases against public utilities in which there was a claim of personal injury or death. Property damage claims were not contemplated by &sect; 60-606(a), and &sect; 60-606(b) therefore applied. The classification based on the public utilities in &sect; 60-606 served a legitimate purpose of reducing forum shopping, and did not violate the equal protection guarantees of Kan. Const.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed. It found that the pre-amended count in the information did charge a crime and sufficiently informed defendant of the nature and cause of the charge so that he could form a defense. The prosecution only inserted the word lewdly into the language of the count. The prosecution's amendment did not result in an additional charge. Thus, defendant was not prejudiced by the amendment. Then, the evidence sufficiently showed that defendant disrobed and caused underage victims to sexually arouse him to support the jury's verdict. Defendant's other alleged errors were without merit. Also, defendant failed to object at trial to the admission of evidence seized from his home during a search by police officers and did not preserve the issue for appellate review. Finally, the trial court's finding that defendant was oblivious to the harm that he caused and that no circumstances existed tending to excuse defendant's criminal conduct justified the trial court's discretionary sentence imposed on defendant. The record did not demonstrate any required prejudice, oppression, or corrupt motive on behalf of the sentencing court to disturb the sentence on appellate review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proposed patient's mother filed a petition that alleged that he was a mentally ill person. A hearing was conducted and the jury found that the proposed patient was in fact a mentally ill person. The two issues on appeal were whether the definition of &quot;mentally ill person&quot; contained in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59-2902(h) (Supp. 1991) and the subsidiary definitions of terms contained therein were overbroad and violative of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and whether the trial court erred in refusing the proposed patient's requested instructions. The court noted that the appeal was based solely on the constitutionality of the statute on its face and as it was applied to the proposed patient. The court held that the statute was constitutional. The legislature intended there to have been a lower standard of danger necessary than a showing of imminent or present danger. The statute did not expressly require a showing of present danger or a recent overt act. Finally, the court held that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The adoption of a &quot;per se&quot; DUI offense did not affect when the &quot;critical stage&quot; of the prosecution began.

The instruction created a permissive inference and adequately recited the law. Because it was no defense that the children's needs were provided by others, and instructions to that effect had been approved, the second instruction was proper.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner of the property entered a plea of no contest to a charge of conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to sell. The charge arose after a search warrant was executed on the property, which was where the owner lived together with a woman and the couple's two children lived. The property owner contended that the forfeiture statute was unconstitutional, but the trial court disagreed. Reversing, the court held that a forfeiture under Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of approaching a public defender with a scheme to suborn perjury or cause a rape victim not to testify against the public defender's client. Defendant offered, for money, to obtain a tape of the victim denying that the rape occurred. The victim testified that defendant offered her money to lie about what happened. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court first held that substantial evidence supported the verdict. Clearly the evidence showed that defendant acted maliciously -- with intent to thwart or interfere in any manner with the orderly administration of justice. Similarly the evidence indicated that the thrust of defendant's action was to dissuade or prevent the victim from testifying at trial. Next the court held that the trial court's entrapment instruction under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3210 was not clearly erroneous for referencing both &sect; 21-3210(a) and (b). Evidence existed to support both prongs of the instruction, and &sect; 21-3210 was written in the disjunctive, requiring the State to prove only one of the prongs.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant homeowners challenged an order of the Douglas District Court (Kansas), which affirmed appellee city's determination that a vacant house owned by the homeowners was a dangerous, unsafe, and unfit structure for human habitation under Baldwin City, Kan., Code &sect; 8-507 (1990) and ordered it to be condemned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners challenged the findings and conclusion that the house was a dangerous and unfit structure that should be demolished because adequate repair would cost more than 50 percent of its fair market value. The homeowners did not object to the findings of fact concerning the condition of the house, nor did they assert that the house was safe or fit for human habitation. The court found that the evidence was abundantly sufficient to support the city's determination that the house was dangerous and unfit for human habitation. The city's finding as to the fair market value of the house was supported by the evidence and was not arbitrary, capricious, or fraudulent. Additionally, Baldwin City, Kan., Code &sect; 8-507 (1990) was not violative of the Fifth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. V, by providing for proscribed taking through over-regulation of private property. The city's exercise of its police power was out of concern for the public safety, not eminent domain. Constitutional provisions against taking private property for public use without just compensation imposed no barrier to the proper exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant thought the victim had observed him peeping in an apartment complex and struck her on the head with the butt of his pistol. She was briefly unconscious, but then described the assailant to her father. The father got his gun then observed defendant in the parking lot. He attempted to detain defendant until police arrived, but defendant shot the father in the face. Defendant was charged with aggravated battery on the victim and the father, and was denied a jury instruction on the theory of self defense in shooting the father. The court held that the fact that defendant used the butt of the gun on the victim did not prevent the possibility of great bodily harm, and the evidence was sufficient. Defendant was escaping from the commission of his forcible felony against the victim when he shot the father, and was thus not entitled to a self defense theory under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3211 because Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3214(1) precluded the defense for such a defendant. The limitation of the self defense theory was not unconstitutional, did not deny defendant a fair trial, and did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's charges stemmed from abuse of his stepdaughter, who was 11 at the time the abuse took place. Defendant argued that he was denied his right to confrontation because the trial court allowed the child to testify via closed circuit television. The court held that K.S.A. 22-3434 (Kansas) allowed the trial court to order the testimony of a child sexual abuse victim to be taken outside defendant's presence, including via closed circuit television, but that caselaw required that the trial court make an individualized determination of the child's ability to testify in defendant's presence prior to issuing such an order. The court acknowledged the trial court had made a pre-trial assessment, but held that it erred in failing to make a second assessment, given the fact that five months had passed and the child may have been more able to testify in defendant's presence. The court then held that the trial court erred in failing to instruct taking indecent liberties as a lesser-included offense of the rape charges, and that the complaint's allegations of indecent liberties was defective because it did not include the term &quot;lewd,&quot; which was a required element of the offense.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed a decision by the Shawnee District Court (Kansas), which convicted defendant of violating Topeka, Kan., Ordinance &sect; 8-45(a)(2) (1991), which prohibited a dog owner from permitting a dog to attack or to bite any person upon the owner's premises.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A mail carrier delivered mail to defendant's residence. As the carrier was leaving the property, a dog ran from the garage and allegedly attacked and bit the carrier. On appeal, the district court permitted the city to amend the complaint to charge permitting a dog to bite a person upon the premises of the owner. The court determined that on trial de novo, defendant was not charged with a different crime, but with an alternative method of violating the &sect; 8-45(a)(2) against attack by dogs. Under precedent, the City had liberal authority to amend the complaint against defendant prior to trial. The court stated that the complaint against defendant was permissibly amended prior to the district court trial. She was not tried for two separate crimes for the same conduct. Her double jeopardy claim had no merit. The court concluded that while &sect; 8-45(a)(2) might have been imprecise, it gave sufficient warning to a person of average intelligence that a person responsible for a dog would have been held liable if he or she allowed the dog to attack another person. The court held that this was sufficient to withstand a constitutional challenge. Thus, the ordinance passed constitutional muster.</SPAN></P>

The use of the uncounseled conviction was not per se invalid and could be used as a basis for determining civil disability, enforceable by criminal sanction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Saline District Court (Kansas), which convicted him of felony possession of methamphetamine, in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-4127b(a)(2) (Supp. 1990). Defendant challenged the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An individual mailed a package. The nervousness of the individual coupled with a foul odor emanating from the package prompted a clerk to notify the manager, who determined that the package was suspicious and had the package opened. The package contained money emanating a strong odor. A sworn affidavit was then used to obtain a search warrant for the residence of the individual. Defendant was not named in the search warrant, but defendant happened to be at the residence when the residence was searched by officers. Defendant was searched, and found to possess drugs. On review, the court found that the trial court improperly placed the burden on defendant to prove the lawfulness of the search. No testimony was offered as to why defendant was searched when the warrant was executed. The trial court overruled the motion to suppress the search of defendant's person without comment, except to state that it was lawful. At trial, the only physical evidence admitted against defendant was the evidence seized during the search. None of the evidence seized from the residence was admitted. The State did not prove that the police had probable cause to search defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and found that the trial court's ruling that the search of defendant was lawful was not supported by the record of the suppression hearing. The cause was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff accident victim appealed from a judgment of the Wyandotte District Court (Kansas), which denied the victim's motion for a new trial after a verdict in favor of defendant contractors in the victim's action to recover for personal injuries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was injured when he fell into an excavation at a home site under construction adjacent to his home. During voir dire, the victim's counsel wanted to make a record of black and minority veniremen in the event the contractors utilized their peremptory strikes to remove minorities from the jury panel. After the contractors had used their peremptory challenges to strike all three black members remaining on the panel the victim's counsel contended that such use of peremptory challenges was a violation of his client's right to due process. The court held that the victim's counsel, while not as clear as he should have been, sufficiently objected to the contractors' use of their peremptory challenges. The United State Supreme Court (Court) applied the Batson test concerning racially motivated peremptory strikes to a civil lawsuit five months after the present case was dismissed. The court concluded that the Court's decision applying the Batson test could be retroactively applied in this case. Therefore, on remand the trial court was to determine whether the contractors had a race neutral reason for striking the three black jurors by peremptory challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case arose from a county election in which the voters approved the spending of bond proceeds on a proposed trafficway south of the city of Lawrence, Kansas.

The trial judge dismissed the citizens' petition for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that: (1) the question of whether the county was obligated to hold a binding election involved questions of law and fact that were not decided by the trial judge and required a remand for determination; (2) the issue of standing also depended on questions of law and fact not addressed by the trial court; and (3) the question of whether the county was bound by the result of the election was one that had to be determined before the case could be resolved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mother sought review of an order of the Butler District Court (Kansas), which entered judgment in favor of respondent father denying her motion for continuation of child support for the couple's son through his senior year in high school and ordering that child support for their daughter be terminated prior to the beginning of her senior year in high school.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon the advice of the school, the parents decided that the children should be held back one year in elementary school. Their son reached his 18th birthday in his junior year and their daughter reached her 18th birthday the summer before her senior year. Under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1610(a)(1), child support payments were automatically extended, so long as the child attended high school, until June 1st of the school year during which the child became 18 years of age. The son turned 18 in March and pursuant to &sect; 60-1610(a)(1) the trial court correctly refused to extend the support for him beyond June 1st. A school year was defined as a 12-month period ending June 30th. The trial court erred in construing the statute with regard to the daughter. The daughter turned 18 the summer between her junior and senior year, by definition, in her senior year. Child support should have been paid for the daughter until the end of her senior year or until she stopped attending high school, whichever came first. The statute did not create classes; therefore the mother's contention that it was unconstitutional was without merit.</SPAN></P>

The widow and estate appealed and claimed that the decedent was an independent contractor because a contract between the decedent's original employer and the company provided that the decedent was not to be considered an employee of the company. The court affirmed and held that the parties could not by their own agreement do away with liabilities imposed by operation of law, and the company was not estopped from arguing that it was a statutory employer, nor had it waived the right to so argue by the written contract.

The court affirmed finding that if defendant was denied his right to cross-examine a witness at the hearing, it was harmless error. Cross-examination of the witness, an officer who was present at the arrest scene, would have had no likelihood of changing the outcome of the suspension hearing. Because defendant was able to examine the witness during the review proceeding, his rights were not substantially prejudiced by the inability to do so at the hearing. There was substantial competent evidence in the record to support the findings that another officer gave the required notices and then asked defendant to take a breath test and that defendant refused to take the test. Defendant, therefore, had no right to contact an attorney before refusing the request to take a breath test. The implied consent law did not violate the Fifth Amendment right to counsel.</SPAN></P>

Admin. Regs. 30-5-86a (1986), 30-5-110 (1986), and 30-5-110a (1986).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The partial hospitalization program was a private corporation serving the mentally ill and funded solely by Medicaid during the audit period. On appeal, the partial hospitalization program alleged three errors: (1) failure to independently review all issues raised, (2) application of Kan. Admin. Regs. 30-5-86a (1986), and (3) failure to hold that both state and federal law require reimbursement for necessary services provided efficiently and economically. The court affirmed. The district court addressed the very issues that the partial hospitalization program claimed were not reviewed, its treatment as a community mental health center for audit purposes and Regulation 30-5-86a (1986)'s reimbursement procedures. Regulation 30-5-86a (1986) applied to the partial hospitalization program through Kan. Admin. Regs. 50-5-110a(a) (1986) as a psychiatric partial hospitalization provider. The rule was valid because it was within SRS' statutory authority. Kan. Admin. Regs. 30-5-86a (1986) was based on reasonable costs, which included actual allowable costs, therefore, the partial hospitalization program's rate calculation did not include bad debts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's order affirming the state audit showing that the hospitalization program owed overpayments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his speedy trial right was violated. Defendant was arraigned, then placed in custody. His court-appointed counsel filed a motion to withdraw because it appeared that defendant was not indigent. The trial court granted the motion to withdraw and ordered defendant to file a new financial affidavit. In all, 145 days elapsed between the arraignment and the trial date. Defendant was in custody for 120 days of that time. The court held that there was no violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3402(2) because only 145 days had elapsed. However, defendant was in custody for 120 days. Because at least 32 days of the delay was due to defendant's counsel's motion to withdraw and the need to hire and prepare new counsel, defendant's right to a speedy trial under &sect; 22-3402(1) was not violated. The trial court correctly excluded evidence of defendant's proffered defense of compulsion. The proffered evidence would not show an imminent threat and therefore, a legal justification for not appearing. The court refused to consider defendant's vagueness challenge to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3814 because it was not preserved for appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was of juvenile age when she was charged with damaging property valued in excess of $ 100. Defendant was convicted under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3611(a)(2), which made a damaging property offense by a juvenile a class E felony. Defendant sought review challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 21-3611. Defendant contended that &sect; 21-3611 denied her equal protection of the law because it allowed for a disparity in the treatment of a juvenile and an adult who committed the same crime under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3720(1), (2). The court upheld the conviction and the constitutionality of the statute holding that the classification created by the challenged statute had a rational basis where it was determined that certain defendants were no longer amenable to juvenile rehabilitative supervision and treatment. A state statute could single out a class of persons for distinctive treatment only if the classification bore a rational relation to the purpose of the legislation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was arrested and a warrant was obtained to search his home and barn, where marijuana growing paraphernalia and plants were found. The court established a rule for determining the sufficiency of informations, holding that the failure of an information to charge a crime could be raised for the first time on appeal, even if a defendant had not first filed a motion to arrest judgment. Applying that rule, the court held that defendant's conviction for possession of marijuana without payment of tax was void. The complaint failed to charge that defendant was a dealer, an essential element of that crime pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-5201(c) (Supp. 1990). The complaint failed to charge possession of marijuana, an element of manufacture of marijuana under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-4127b(b).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's wife, who was nine months pregnant, entered a retail store to shop. After she had been in the store a few minutes, management approached her and accused her of shoplifting. She accompanied a manager to the rear of the store and, according to controverted testimony, either put some items down or threw them down. She ran toward the front of the store. A checker physically stopped her when she came to the front of the store and she was forcibly restrained. Defendant testified that he was afraid his wife would fall and injure herself or the baby, and that he asked the manager to let his wife go. When she was not released, he pushed the manager to free his wife. Defendant was convicted of battery. On appeal, the court found that defendant was not denied his right to a speedy trial as provided by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3402 because he explicitly waived it. The court noted that defendant was without counsel by his own conduct of failing to stay in contact with his attorneys, missing the hearing on the motion to withdraw, failing to secure new counsel, and finally waiving his right to a speedy trial and accepting the trial court's order for appointment of counsel.</SPAN></P>

He argued there was insufficient foundation because he was denied an opportunity for an independent testing in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1004 (Supp. 1989). The court held that there was no evidence in the record that defendant communicated his request to obtain additional testing to a law enforcement officer. Further, officers had no obligation to set defendant, a DUI suspect, free so that he could obtain the additional testing. The second foundation argument made by defendant was that there was not sufficient foundation to allow the result of the Intoximeter test because the operator had not reviewed the operator's manual since his certification classes about three years previously. The court held that the trial court did not err in finding sufficient foundation to allow into evidence the results of the Intoximeter test. The breath test result was not inadmissible as a matter of law.

After receiving the favorable result from the Board, the employee resumed his employment and initiated an action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1981 and 1983 (1988), against the Department and another Department employee and alleged both defendants were guilty of racially discriminatory acts and practices resulting in his termination. The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss, and the employee appealed. The court affirmed and held that the trial court did not err in concluding that the employee's discriminatory discharge claim was barred because 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1981 was not available in a discriminatory discharge case. The court held that retroactive application of a case providing for such strict interpretation of &sect; 1981 was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a four-year-old girl and her mother lived in different apartments in the same building. Defendant was convicted of enticement as a result of the mother seeing the girl sitting on defendant's lap with defendant's arms on her waist and leg. On appeal, the court held that because the trial court's instructions presented the jury with five options to establish the offense, and because there was no evidence to support at least one of those options, the general verdict of guilty had to be set aside. Although the mother's testimony of her knowledge of defendant's prior, similar convictions was relevant and admissible under Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Norton District Court (Kansas), which convicted him of indecent liberties with a child under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3503. Defendant alleged that the complaint was defective because it did not allege non-marriage to the victim, and that the trial court erred by not giving a charge on the lesser-included offense of attempt and by admitting the child's videotaped statement under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-460(dd).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found lying naked with a partially clothed, 15-year-old mentally limited girl on top of him and was convicted as a result. The court held that because the non-marriage to the victim was an element of the version of Kan. Stat. &sect; 21-3503 in effect when the crime was committed, and because the retrospective application of the amended version of &sect; 21-3503, which deleted non-marriage as an element but made marriage a defense, would violate defendant's protection from ex-post facto laws, the complaint was fatally defective for not alleging non-marriage. Because defendant did not allege that he attempted but failed to have sexual intercourse with the victim, he was not entitled to a jury instruction on the lesser-included offense of attempt. Because the parties stipulated that the victim was not competent to testify and was thus unavailable, and because there was substantial evidence from the testimony of a social worker, from the victim's use of anatomically correct dolls, and from her unprompted identification of defendant, that the victim's statement to the social worker had the indicia of reliability, the victim's videotaped statement was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured and the tortfeasor were in a collision, in which both claimed to have a green light. The insured sued the tortfeasor for an amount in excess of the tortfeasor's coverage. The insured sought underinsured motorist coverage from his insurer and the insurer intervened. The tortfeasor offered to confess judgment, but the insurer refused to be bound by it. The jury found each party 50 percent at fault. The insured contested various rulings of the trial court. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for a new trial. The court concluded that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-284(f) (Supp. 1990) did not bar the insurer from intervening after 60 days, but resulted only in a waiver of subrogation rights. The court agreed that the insurer was not bound by a confession of judgment because under &sect; 40-284(b) the insurer was entitled to a judicial determination of liability. Because jury instructions requested by the insured on certain traffic regulations supported the insured's negligence per se theory, the court found that the insured was prejudiced by their omission. Last, the court determined that &sect; 8-1545(a)(2) regulating left-hand turns was not void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

The district court reinstated the driver's privileges after determining that the breath test was invalid because the breath sample was collected more than two hours after the driver operated a vehicle. On appeal by the KDR, the court reversed and remanded for reinstatement of the suspension. The court held that the plain language of implied consent statute,&nbsp;Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1001 et seq. (1990 Supp.), imposed no such limitation to the admissibility of test results for administrative suspension purposes. Based on the statute, the law enforcement officer was required to have reasonable grounds to believe the driver was operating or attempting to operate a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. The reasonable grounds had to exist before the officer requested the driver to submit to a test pursuant to &sect; 8-1001(b). The longer the delay between the operation of the vehicle and the administration of the test, the more unreasonable the officer's grounds become for believing the driver drove while under the influence of alcohol.</SPAN></P>

The result of the ruling was an affirmation of an administrative order that suspended the motorist's driver's license for refusal to submit to a breath test. The motorist argued that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1001(f)(1) (Supp. 1990) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arresting officer complied with the prepared written procedure when advising the motorist of the options available under the implied consent law, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1001. The motorist contended that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1001(f)(1)(C), which provided that there was no right to consult with an attorney regarding whether to submit to testing, violated the Fifth Amendment right to counsel. The court held that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1001(f)(1) did not impermissibly violate the Fifth Amendment and upheld the order. The Fifth Amendment right to an attorney only applied to prevent an accused from self-incrimination in situations where he was being interrogated. The procedure advising the motorist of his options under the implied consent law was not custodial. Moreover, the court found no evidence that the officer questioned the motorist in a way that could have been characterized as custodial interrogation. Because the taking of physical evidence to determine intoxication did not constitute custodial interrogation, defendant's Fifth Amendment privileges were not invoked. The court also applied the presumption of constitutionality after examining the purpose of the implied consent law.</SPAN></P>

Upon pulling defendant over, the officer noted that defendant's eyes were watery, defendant looked dazed, and defendant smelled of alcohol.

Defendant's breath alcohol level exceeded .10, the amount set by statute as a crime. Defendant was convicted at trial of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or at a time when the alcohol concentration in his breath was .10 or greater. Defendant moved for dismissal on the ground that the evidence was insufficient. The record showed the trial court properly applied Overland Park, Kan., Code &sect; 12.04.030(a)(1). There was no violation of due process. The breath test results were properly admitted. There was no contemporaneous objection to the admission of the test results based on the protocol followed, so the issue was not preserved for review.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee experienced pain in her shoulders and missed some work. When she returned to work, she was still experiencing significant pain. She talked to the safety manager of appellee employer who suggested that if she could not work she should seek other employment. The employee worked the following week at light duty jobs. When she was unable to continue due to pain in her shoulders and arms, she quit. The court held that the record supported the decisions below that the employee was disqualified because she did not have good cause to terminate her employment. The evidence supported the conclusion that the employee left voluntarily and was not discharged where she worked for a full week after she was allegedly discharged, and she failed to present any medical evidence that she was forced to quit for medical reasons. Most damaging to her position was her doctor's failure to extend her excuse. The only medical evidence in the record was a note from a doctor which specifically indicated that he did not advise her to quit her job. The trial court would also have been affirmed based on the finding that the employee was not eligible to receive unemployment compensation.</SPAN></P>

She appealed and argued that the trial court erred in denying her motion to quash her arrest and to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the search of her car and her purse. The court found that the initial questioning of defendant was not an unconstitutional intrusion because the belief that defendant was violating Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4101 gave the officer the right to inquire about her identity. The court also noted that defendant voluntarily got into the police car and that her purse was not searched until the booking process, when its contents were inventoried and the cocaine was found. The court held that, under the facts of the case, and in particular the officer's admission that he retrieved the purse in order to ascertain defendant's identity, the search of the purse was not permissible as a Terry search. The court held that the State could not rely on the &quot;inevitable discovery doctrine,&quot; because there was no evidence the purse would have been available for a custodial search if the officer had not taken it out of the car.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a foreclosure action, the trial court found that the wheat crop that was planted during the period of redemption was part of the realty and passed as a result of the foreclosure to the purchaser.

On March 29, 1990, the mortgagors filed an appeal of the trial court's decision on the ownership of the crop. The court dismissed the appeal, holding that: (1) the issues raised by the mortgagors were merely an attempt to collaterally attack the trial court's November 28, 1989, order determining the ownership of the wheat crop and the court had no jurisdiction to reconsider the issue because the mortgagors did not file a notice of appeal until after the time for appeal had passed and the mortgagors also failed to docket their appeal within 21 days as required by Kan. R. Civ. P. 2.04, 2.041 (1990); and (2) because there was no timely appeal challenging the validity of the trial court's judgment concerning foreclosure, confirmation of the sale, or determination of ownership of the crops, those issues were res judicata and not subject to appeal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought review and contended that the classification of the sodomy charge violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because enticement of a child was a lesser included offense of sodomy. Under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3107, when the same conduct of defendant could have established the commission of more than one crime under the laws, defendant could have been prosecuted for each crime. The court determined that there was a two-step test to resolve the question of whether an offense was a lesser included offense: (1) to determine whether all of the statutory elements of the lesser included crime were among the statutory elements needed to prove the charged crime; (2) to determine whether the evidence proving the charged crime would also be used to prove the lesser included crime. The court found that enticement was not a lesser included offense because the elements were different than sodomy. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

When the officer asked defendant to step down from the truck, defendant disregarded the instruction not to remove his jacket. The officer searched the jacket and defendant's person, discovering a firearm, drug paraphernalia, and illegal drugs. Defendant challenged his convictions on the ground that the stop was unjustified and the search was illegal. The court upheld defendant's convictions. The city ordinance provided a valid basis to stop the truck; the officers saw defendant and the other truck occupants committing a traffic crime and acted reasonably in stopping the truck. The officer's observation of the speed bullet loader on defendant's person, along with defendant's action in removing his jacket, justified the search of defendant's jacket and person; the search was necessary for the protection of the officers and was reasonably designed to discover weapons.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured was injured in an automobile accident and received PIP benefits from her insurer, as well as additional medical benefits pursuant to a seat belt endorsement. The seat belt endorsement provided additional benefits if the insured was injured while wearing a seat belt. The insured sued a third party and received a recovery. The insurance company asserted rights of subrogation for both the PIP benefits and the additional benefits paid under the endorsement. The trial court granted the insurance company's motion for summary judgment and the insured appealed. The court reversed, holding that Kan. Admin. Regs. 40-1-20 prohibited insurance policies from providing for subrogation of medical payments. Although subrogation of PIP payments was expressly provided for by statute, the benefits paid under the seat belt endorsement were not PIP payments. The court distinguished another case that allowed subrogation, because the seat belt endorsement was a separate endorsement, and the benefits were not designated as excess PIP benefits. The court also found that the regulation was not void for vagueness, and that it was based on valid statutory authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer watched a car drive down a street and into a driveway of a house that he was watching. The officer saw a motorist leave the car from the driver's side and did not see anyone else leave the car. Because the motorist did not breathe enough air into a machine when the officer asked the motorist to take a breath test, the motorist was deemed to have refused the test. The Department's resulting suspension of the motorist's driver's license was upheld by the trial court.

Ann. &sect; 8-1001(a) and (b) (Supp. 1988) required the motorist to take the test whether or not the motorist was, in fact, driving the car.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and respondent father were divorced in 1982. By agreement of the parties, the mother was to have custody of the minor children. However, the father later filed a motion for change of custody; he ultimately dismissed that motion when the parties entered into a voluntary agreement whereby an aunt was to care for the children. Over four years later, the mother filed a motion in the trial court seeking to have custody restored to her. The trial court denied the motion, and the court affirmed. It held that the trial court did not err in denying the mother's motion because she failed to carry her burden of showing that a change of custody would materially promote the welfare of the children. The court noted that the trial court had no evidence before it to show that the children were not well cared-for by the aunt or that the mother would have been a better parent. The trial court also properly refused to apply the parental preference doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, injured victims and heirs at law of deceased victims, sought review of a judgment entered in the Johnson District Court (Kansas) that granted summary judgment to appellee insurance company and dismissed the complaint of the injured victims and the heirs at law of the deceased victims. The trial court determined that a general liability policy issued by the insurance company did not provide coverage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance company initiated a declaratory judgment action to determine whether coverage existed under a general business liability policy for damages for negligent entrustment for damages that arose out of an automobile accident. The trial court determined that the policy did not provide coverage in this situation. On appeal, the insurance company argued that the injuries arose from the use of an automobile owned by the insured and therefore, the policy excluded coverage for negligent entrustment of the automobile. The court rejected the insurance company's argument, relying on a prior decision of the Kansas Supreme Court in Upland Mutual Insurance, Inc. v. Noel, 214 Kan 145 (1974), which had previously determined that negligent entrustment was not based on the negligence of the driver, but on the negligence of the entrustor in supplying the chattel to the negligent driver. The court found that the addition of the words &quot;arising out of&quot; to the exclusion clause to preclude coverage for negligent entrustment of an automobile. The court found that the trial court's consideration of facts related to the insured's conduct was irrelevant to whether the policy precluded coverage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Reno District Court (Kansas), which convicted him of conspiracy to sell methamphetamine, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 21-3302, 65-4127b(b); possession of methamphetamine with intent to sell, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-4127b(b); and possession of methamphetamine without a tax stamp, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-5201 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his convictions on three drug-related charges and contended that his conviction on the possession charge should be vacated because it was an included crime under his conviction of conspiracy. The court disagreed and held that possession was not a lesser included crime of conspiracy to sell a controlled substance and that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3107(2) did not prohibit defendant's convictions on both offenses. Defendant also argued that the convictions were unconstitutionally multiplicitous. Although defendant did not raise this issue at trial, the court agreed to consider it because multiplicity could be raised on appeal if necessary to serve the ends of justice or to prevent denial of fundamental rights. However, the court affirmed the convictions because it held that the two charges were separate and distinct offenses. Finally, defendant asserted that his right to a speedy trial was violated. The court rejected this argument and affirmed the trial court's judgment because it found that only 166 days of the period between arrest and trial was attributable to the State and that defendant was tried within the statutory time constraints.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property in question was deeded to the husband and wife. The deed to the couple mentioned a tenancy by the entireties, but also mentioned the heirs and assigns of the couple, individually. The husband died and the property was treated as if it were held as a joint tenancy by the couple by the probate court. The next year the wife died. The heirs of the deceased wife attempted to sell the property, but the sale was impeded when their title was questioned by a title examiner, who required that they quiet title against the heirs of the deceased husband. A quiet title action was commenced and the trial court awarded the heirs of the deceased husband one-half of the property. The heirs of the deceased wife sought review contending that a right of survivorship existed and that the probate court treatment of the property was res judicata against the heirs of the deceased husband. The court affirmed, holding that the use of &quot;joint&quot; in the language of a deed without further explanation did not create a joint tenancy. Because the probate court failed to comply with Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59-2249, its ruling was not binding on the parties and did not bar a collateral attack.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of one-half of the property to the heirs of the deceased husband and one-half to the heirs of the deceased wife in the quiet title action.</SPAN></P>
