</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Family Court (Rhode Island) issued an order pursuant to R. I. Gen. Laws &sect; 14-1-30 to bar petitioners, reporter and newspaper publisher, from a hearing involving a juvenile, and to bar petitioners from an future hearings unless they agreed in advance not to publish the names of juveniles. Petitioners applied for a writ of certiorari to review the order and the validity of &sect; 14-1-30. The petition was granted and the writ was issued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners published the name of a juvenile who was involved in a family court hearing. Pursuant to &sect; 14-1-30, which excluded all but those with a direct interest in the case from attending hearings involving juveniles, the family court barred the reporter from attending the juvenile's hearings. The family court also barred petitioners from attending any future juvenile hearings unless they agreed in advance not to publish the names of the juveniles. The court granted petitioners' application for a writ of certiorari to review the order. Upon review, the court held that the order was invalid because it barred petitioners for publishing lawfully obtained information; thus, barring them from the proceedings amounted to a penalty for having published information that they were allowed to print. The court further found that the portion that conditioned their attendance at other hearings was impermissibly overbroad and an unconstitutional prior restraint on the press. However, the court held that the invalidity of the order did not extend to the statute, and the fact that members of the press could be excluded under &sect; 14-1-30 did not render the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the family court order barring petitioners from the then current and future hearings was invalid. However, the court held that the statute pursuant to which the order was entered was not unconstitutional. Thus, the petition for certiorari was granted in part and denied in part. The matter was remanded to the family court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, state and city, appealed a judgment from the superior court (Rhode Island), which dismissed the city's complaint against defendant retailers. The city sought to enjoin nine large retailers from selling products on Sunday other than those for which their Sunday sales licenses were issued. The superior court held that R. I. Gen. Laws &sect; 5-23-2 (1956) (1976 Reenactment) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retailers obtained Sunday sales licenses that permitted only the sale of bakery and/or gardening products. The city brought an action to enjoin the retailers from selling other products on Sunday. The state intervened as a plaintiff. The trial justice denied injunctive relief and dismissed the complaint on the basis that the classification of stores by size was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that the state's Sunday closing law was a rational means to achieve the legitimate state interest in promoting a common day of rest and recreation. The court held that limiting the size of stores that could open on Sunday minimized commercial activity and maximized the number of citizens who enjoyed a day of rest, while allowing products or services necessary for the day to remain available. The statutory exemptions were also rationally related to the overall goals of the Sunday closing law and were not a capricious exercise of the lawmaking power. The statute did not deprive the retailers of equal protection or due process. Because each retailer violated the terms of its license, they were subject to a suit for injunctive relief under &sect; 5-23-6(C).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment, which had been in favor of the retailers, that had held that the Sunday closing law was unconstitutional. The court remanded to the superior court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of one count of conspiracy to kidnap with intent to extort, two counts of kidnapping with intent to extort, one count of kidnapping, one count of committing a crime of violence when armed with a firearm, one count of carrying a pistol without a license, and three counts of assault with a dangerous weapon from the Superior Court (Rhode Island).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant abducted three teenagers at gunpoint, put them in the trunk of a car and drove to a remote area. He phoned the neighbor of one of the teenagers and demanded money. The teenagers eventually were released after convincing defendant that his accomplice had abandoned him. Defendant asserted on appeal that the trial court erred in denying his motions for an individual voir dire of prospective jurors out of the presence of the other jurors because of the massive prejudicial pretrial publicity surrounding the case. The court affirmed defendant's convictions and dismissed defendant's appeal holding that defendant suffered no substantial prejudice by the voir dire procedure employed by the trial court. The court found that the trial court went to great lengths during voir dire to inquire of the prospective jurors whether or not they had formulated an impression or opinion about the facts or about the parties in the case. The court also held defendant's contention that the exclusion of college students and professors from sitting on a jury was meritless and did not violate defendant's right to a fair cross-section of the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed a judgment of the superior court (Rhode Island), which convicted them of conspiracy and various drug charges. Defendants raised numerous issues on appeal involving alleged violations of their right to confrontation, failure to properly suppress evidence, insufficient evidence for convictions, and improper conviction of a lesser included offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of conspiracy and various drug law violations. On appeal, the court held (1) that defendants' assertion that their inability to cross-examine a prosecution witness resulted in a deprivation of their right to confrontation failed because defendants should have asked to have the witness' testimony stricken but failed to do so; (2) that there was no error in denying defendants' motion to grant immunity to the witness once the witness invoked his privilege because defendants were without standing to either challenge or seek grants of immunity for a prosecution witness; (3) that the trial court's refusal to suppress tapes and transcripts of conversations that were the product of wiretaps and electronic surveillance was not error because a court order was not required before monitoring and the informant consented; and (4) that transcripts of the recordings were properly introduced at trial with their accuracy testified to by the police. The court dismissed one defendant's conviction for a lesser included offense and, because there was insufficient evidence to prove his knowledge of the conspiracy, reversed his conviction for conspiracy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied and dismissed the appeals of two defendants, and granted in part and denied in part the appeal of another defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner appealed, by petition for a writ of certiorari, from the judgment of a superior court (Rhode Island) that affirmed the decision of defendant Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council denying approval of the property owner's use of an individual sewage disposal system (ISDS). The council concluded that the use of the system was harmful to the marsh ecosystem.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner, whose land abutted a pond, obtained conditional approval from the Rhode Island Department of Health to install the ISDS. The council, noting that the ISDS often malfunctioned and that it introduced nitrogens, nitrates, and phosphates into the marsh, voted to deny approval. The superior court affirmed that decision. The supreme court denied and dismissed the property owner's petition for a writ of certiorari, concluding that the regulation of the property owner's use of the marshland was not a compensable taking. Further, the property owner had no property right to discharge waste into the surrounding area. In view of the ecological importance of the coastal area and the likelihood that the ISDS would have polluted the marshland, the council's denial was a valid exercise of police power for the protection of public health and safety. The court also ruled that the state permissibly delegated limited portions of legislative power to the council when it enacted R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 46-23-6(B). The delegation was within the bounds of R.I. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 1, 2. Finally, the court ruled that the council validly exercised its authority in denying approval of the ISDS.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant petitioned for certiorari review of a judgment of the Rhode Island district court, which convicted him of three counts of keeping a pit bulldog for the purpose of dog fights, in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 4-1-10 (1976). He claimed R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 12-22-1 (1956 and Cum. Supp. 1980), which authorized direct review of the district court's action by way of certiorari, violated his right to a jury trial under the state constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-1-2 (1956 and Cum. Supp. 1980), the district court had original jurisdiction when an offense was classified as a misdemeanor or a violation. R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 12-22-1 (1956 and Cum. Supp. 1980) provided for an appeal to the superior court for any offense other than a violation. The appeal was a de novo appeal and was to be tried by a jury. Section 12-22-1 authorized certiorari review of a violation conviction. Defendant's possession convictions were classified as violations. The court held that the failure to provide a de novo appeal to the superior court for violation convictions violated a defendant's right to a jury trial under the state constitution. The state constitution had been construed to guarantee a defendant a right to trial by jury if he would have had that right when the state constitution was adopted in 1842. In 1842, a defendant could appeal a decision of a magistrate, who occupied a similar position to that of a district court judge, to the common pleas court, a trial court that had criminal jurisdiction similar to that possessed by the superior court. This appeal was a de novo appeal with a right to trial by jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the petition for certiorari, quashed the judgments appealed from, and remanded the case to the district court with direction that defendant be given an opportunity to perfect his claim to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff town solicitor and his assistants appealed a Superior Court (Rhode Island) decision that dismissed their action that they were unconstitutionally terminated on the basis of political affiliation. After an initial appeal of the dismissal resulted in the case being remanded for a hearing on the merits, the parties agreed to rely on the transcript and exhibits of the previous hearing and a new trial justice affirmed the dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The solicitor and his assistants alleged that their dismissals violated the federal constitution, that they were void under the town's home rule charter, and that defendant town council and town manager violated their rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.On appeal, the court held that the trial justices correctly found that the solicitor and his assistants were dismissed solely for political reasons. The court held that the solicitor and his assistants were not entitled to First Amendment protection from patronage dismissals and held that party affiliation was an appropriate standard to guide selection of solicitors by the town manager. The court held that the dismissals did not violate the solicitors' freedoms of belief and association. The court also held that, under the town's charter, the solicitor served at the pleasure of the manager and was subject to dismissal by a newly elected manager, just as his assistants were subject to removal by the solicitor's replacement. The court further found that the solicitors' rights under &sect; 1983 were not violated. The court denied and dismissed the solicitors' appeal and affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that the solicitors' constitutional rights to free speech and freedom of association were not denied as the result of their termination on the basis of political affiliation because the town manager had authority to remove the solicitor under the home rule charter. The court held that the solicitors' &sect; 1983 rights were not violated and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial justice gave a reasoned and careful consideration of the issues raised by the presence of the uniformed state troopers and, after consideration of all relevant factors, found that the presence of the troopers in no way prejudiced defendants. A witness's in-court identification rested on a sufficient independent source: her encounter with that defendant during the course of the robbery. Defendants chose their trial strategy. They waived their opportunity to elicit what they asserted would have constituted exculpatory evidence from one defendant in the hope that the prosecutor would take their bait on his cross-examination.

On remand, the court addressed defendant's contentions that the trial court erred in denying his motions for acquittal on the robbery and kidnapping counts. The court observed that where the evidence presented was entirely circumstantial, it had to be not only consistent with guilt but also had to be inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of innocence. Any evidence that suggested that the cause of the victim's death was not related to the victim's robbery was purely speculative and in no way rose to the level of a reasonable inference. However, the robbery conviction had to be vacated on double jeopardy grounds because the guilty verdict amounted to a special finding that the victim met his death during the course of the robbery. The court held that any movement of a victim during the course of a crime could not be punished under the kidnapping statute,&nbsp;R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-26-1, unless the movement exceeded that necessary to facilitate the crime at hand. The kidnapping conviction was vacated because the victim's confinement and asportation had no significance independent of the robbery and murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the operator applied for a renewal of his license for his solid-waste-management facility, the Department of Environment Management (DEM) informed the operator that his license would not be renewed until violations at the facility were remedied. After the DEM denied the operator's application for renewal, he requested a hearing. The DEM affirmed the denial of the operator's application. A superior court ruled that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 23-18.9-8, which authorized the DEM director's licensing of solid-waste-management facilities, was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. In addition, the superior court found that the operator was not afforded due process. On appeal, the court found that licensing and rule-making power was properly transferred to the director through the Legislature. The directive that waste-management activities be conducted in an environmentally sound manner created a sufficiently intelligible standard by which the DEM could function. In addition, the operator's hearing officer's actions at the hearing did not show bias. Therefore, the court quashed the superior court's judgment and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent former husband appealed two decrees from a family court (Rhode Island). The first decree denied his petition to amend a divorce decree requiring him to pay child support and alimony to petitioner former wife, found him in contempt for failure to make said payments, and ordered him to pay the wife's counsel fees. The second decree denied his request for a stay pending an appeal and granted the parties' child counsel fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties' final divorce decree ordered the husband to pay child support until their minor child became emancipated and also ordered him to pay alimony to the wife. The husband discontinued making support payments when their child turned 18. Two months later, he ceased payment of alimony and filed a petition to amend the divorce decree. The husband then filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy. The family court denied the husband's petition and found him in contempt. The husband's request for a stay was also denied. The court sustained the husband's appeal. Counsel fees were specifically distinguished from alimony in R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 15-5-16 (Supp. 1980); thus, the family court erred when it determined that counsel fees were not dischargeable in bankruptcy. Alimony payments were improperly included as an exception to the automatic stay provisions of Fed. R. Bankr. P. 401. An automatic stay, thus, was in effect as to the contempt proceedings, and the husband should not have been found in contempt for failure to pay alimony. Because the parties' child turned 18, she was emancipated, and the husband's child support obligation automatically terminated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the husband's appeal and remanded the cause to the family court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot and killed his brother when the brother, in a drunken state, started to hit his mother.

The court reversed defendant's conviction. The court concluded that looking at the charge as a whole, a reasonable juror could have been misled by the instructions, and thus defendant's due-process rights could have been prejudiced. Even though the trial justice charged that the prosecution had prove all the elements of murder beyond a reasonable doubt, his restatement of the rule concerning the issue of self-defense was constitutionally defective. Once defendant raised the issue of self-defense, the words of the charge were to convey to the jury that the burden fell on the prosecution to prove lack of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. Failure to so instruct was reversible error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction by the Superior Court (Rhode Island) for second-degree murder. Defendant was indicted along with two others for the stabbing death of the decedent that occurred when defendants and the decedent were incarcerated. The trial judge granted the State's motion to try each defendant separately pursuant to R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 14. The death sentence originally imposed was reduced to a life sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">According to defendant, the trial court erred when it granted the State's motion to sever his trial from that of his codefendants. The court, however, ruled that although a severance at the State's insistence was rare, the relief was available upon a showing of prejudice to the State. Defendant's worry about being &quot;left out on a limb alone,&quot; was no defense to the grant of the motion for severance. The trial court also did not err when it excluded three potential jurors for cause after they expressed serious doubts that they could subordinate their views on capital punishment to their duty to decide defendant's fate on the evidence. In addition, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant's request to allow the jury to view various portions of the correctional facility where the crime occurred. The trial court attempted to balance the benefits to be gained from the view against the potential for prejudice. He had personally taken a view, and was hesitant to expose the jurors to the prison locale. Furthermore, the jury had the benefit of photographs of the cell-block area where the homicide occurred.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed, affirmed defendant's conviction on a charge of assault with a dangerous weapon, and sentenced him under &sect; 12-19-21 for being a habitual offender. The court held that the prosecution's desire to induce defendant to forgo trial on his pending case constituted a lawful basis for instituting habitual-criminal proceedings as part of the plea-bargaining process.The prosecutor's conduct, which simply presented defendant with the unpleasant alternatives of forgoing trial or facing charges on which he was plainly subject to prosecution, did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

Before the hearing, the employer requested that a subpoena duces tecum issue, directing another former employer of the employee to produce records of the employee's wages. The commission did not subpoena the former employer's records, but it subpoenaed the employer's records. The commission then denied the employer's request to depose the employee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After arresting defendant for driving under the influence of alcohol, defendant was given his Miranda rights and he was advised of his implied consent rights under R.I.

Defendant signed the consent form and submitted to the test. The test results were consistent with a finding of intoxication. Defendant argued that the test results should have been suppressed because the threat of license suspension coerced him into submitting to the test and rendered his consent involuntary. The court affirmed the denial of defendant's suppression motion and affirmed the conviction. The court held that defendant knowingly and voluntarily consented to the breathalyzer test. The suspension of a driver's license and/or the imposition of a fine for failing to take a breathalyzer test was a proper exercise of the State's police power.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of rape and committing an abominable and detestable crime against nature. Defendants challenged the constitutionality of the statute proscribing the crime against nature and two defendants contended that the trial court erred in denying their motions for severance. Defendants also contested certain evidentiary rulings of the trial court, including the exclusion of the introduction of the victim's prior sexual conduct with third parties. In addition, one defendant claimed he was not afforded the effective assistance of counsel. The court affirmed defendants' convictions, finding that the crime of committing an abominable and detestable crime against nature was not impermissibly vague and did not deprive them of their right to privacy, having previously disposed of those issues in another case. The court also concluded that trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for severance because defendants failed to show prejudice or unfairness. Lastly, the court determined that the trial court did not err in its evidentiary rulings and that one defendant was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant owned a company that operated two pharmacies. The health department audited one store and uncovered irregularities that prompted the State to file an indictment under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act. Defendant argued that the person who signed and submitted orders for controlled substances, if registered as the pharmacist at a location, was the person who was subject to &sect; 21-28-3.11. The court disagreed, finding that &sect; 21-28-3.11 indicated that the person giving an official written order was distinct from a duly authorized agent who signed the order. Thus, the person described in &sect; 21-28-3.11 as the one giving an official written order was the person who was named as the registrant on each order form. However, the trial court's instructions did not direct the jury to determine whether defendant or his company was the registrant named on the order forms, which was the factual predicate for determining that either was a party to the transactions. The trial court also erred when it admitted into evidence a letter from a pharmacist who had been previously employed at the store both for the limited purpose of impeachment and for the truth of the matter asserted therein.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws &sect; 11-37-2 (1969 Reenactment), and sentenced him to five years in prison, three years to serve and two years suspended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the day of the alleged incident defendant took the complainant to buy greeting cards. The complainant testified that defendant drove her to his apartment and had sexual intercourse with her. Defendant denied having sexual intercourse with the complainant, but he admitted that he fondled the complainant. Section 11-37-2 provided for imprisonment of up to 15 years for a person who had carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 16. Rhode Island law adopted the common law definition of &quot;carnal knowledge,&quot; that is, penetration of the female sex organ by the male sex organ. Consequently, only males were subject to the statute's proscription. Defendant argued that his conviction violated the equal protection clause because the statute only protected females and punished males. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that &sect; 11-37-2 bore a substantial relationship to the achievement of several important state objectives, including preventing young girls from getting pregnant and protecting them from the severe physical and psychological consequences of engaging in coitus before attaining the age of consent. The court concluded that the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Ex parte orders were issued by a justice of the Family Court (Rhode Island), which granted temporary custody of the children to respondent Child Welfare Services. The court conducted a dependency-and-neglect hearing against the parents and the children were found dependent and were placed in respondent's custody. Petitioner mother filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The family court justice found that the evidence was clear and convincing that the children were without proper parental care and supervision and held that the finding of dependency was the only way that the court might be able to protect the children. The mother argued on appeal that the trial justice erred in finding that her children were dependent and urged the court to adopt a strict scrutiny standard of review for dependency and neglect proceedings. The state supreme court declined to adopt such a standard. The court held that the parents' interests in maintaining the integrity of the family unit and control of child rearing were essential considerations, but that the best interests and welfare of the children outweighed all other considerations. The court held that the trial justice acted in both a remedial and preventive role in finding the children to be dependent. The court also held that the record of the case amply supported the trial justice's finding of dependency and that due regard was given to the parents' rights given the paramount needs and interests of the children. The court denied and dismissed the mother's appeal and affirmed the decision below.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant tax administrator reversed an assessment as to a residuary legacy but held that the legatee was not exempt from taxation. Plaintiff taxpayers sought judicial review of his decision in Superior Court (Rhode Island). Before trial, he stipulated that the legatee was exempt and refunded all taxes collected without interest. The trial court awarded interest. The administrator sought certiorari as to the interest award. The writ was issued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that the trial justice erred in relying on fundamental fairness to justify the interest award. The court also held that the judiciary could not broaden a statute through interpretation unless its clear purpose would fail without the implication. The court held that the trial justice erred in holding that administrative appeals were civil actions under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 9-21-10. The court held that the administrator's failure to apply a statutory exemption from taxation violated R.I. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. In light of the evidence and the language of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 44-22-1(b) and 44-22-11(1), the court held that collection of the estate and transfer taxes constituted a taking within the meaning of R.I. Const., art. I, &sect; 16. The court held that the taxpayers were entitled to an interest award of six percent on their refund of estate and transfer taxes and directed that the trial court judgment be modified so as to correct the interest rate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court could not entertain the criminal complaint because it was brought by an interim chief of police without his furnishing surety for costs as required by &sect; 12-6-2. He also contended that his self-help repossession of his motorcycle, which had been unlawfully seized by the officer, did not constitute a violation of &sect; 11-32-1 and the criminal complaint filed against him was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite. Finally, he contended that &sect; 11-32-1 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court found that the interim chief was exempt from providing surety under &sect; 12-6-6 as the chief of police and as a member of the state police. The court refused to consider defendant's self-repossession argument because he had failed to raise it before the trial court. The court concluded that the complaint was not constitutionally defective because it clearly alleged that defendant acted willfully in obstructing the officer in the execution of his duty and that he knew the officer was in fact a police officer. The court found that &sect; 11-32-1 was constitutionally applied to defendant and he had no standing to challenge it application to others.</SPAN></P>

The constitutional infirmity was that a resident of the community, not made sufficiently aware of what he could or could not do, was subject to criminal prosecution simply because some of his neighbors had a low threshold of annoyance and could not refrain from a violent reaction to conduct, language, or carriage that they deemed offensive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the lack of a definition of the term article in &sect; 13-2-34 rendered the statute vague in contravention of the U.S. Const. amend.

The court held that defendant lacked standing to challenge &sect; 13-2-34 on the ground that it might be applied unconstitutionally to others in hypothetical situations not before the court. The court rejected the State's argument that the trial court's instruction to the jury before the commencement of trial constituted compliance with R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 11. The court observed that the delivery of such an instruction did not assure the court that defendant was fully aware of the nature of the charges against her or the consequences of her guilty plea.

Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 11-10-1, 11-34-5 (1956, 1969 Reenactment). Defendant was acquitted of rape and kidnapping. The trial justice cleared the courtroom of all spectators when the complainant testified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complainant testified that defendant, whom she had met in a bar, told her he had a knife, ordered her into his car, drove to a secluded area, and had sexual and anal intercourse with her. Defendant told the complainant and the police that two other women had accused him of rape. The police found a knife in the glove compartment of defendant's car. Defendant claimed that the trial justice deprived him of his right to a public trial, admitted into evidence the fruits of an illegal search and seizure and hearsay statements about defendant's prior bad acts, and improperly sustained his own objections to questions asked by defense counsel. Defendant also challenged the constitutionality of &sect;&sect; 11-10-1 and 11-34-5. The court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court held that the temporary exclusion of spectators was permissible when a witness had to testify to the details of a sexual assault. The court found that &sect;&sect; 11-10-1 and 11-34-5 were constitutional because the right of privacy did not apply to private, unnatural copulation between unmarried adults and the statutes were not vague, based upon common law meaning, statutory history, and prior judicial interpretations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied and dismissed defendant's appeal, affirmed his convictions for transporting for immoral purposes and for committing an abominable and detestable crime against nature, and remanded the case to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought review of the judgments of the Superior Court (Rhode Island), which convicted them of three counts of carrying a weapon without a license, assault with intent to murder, and assault with a dangerous weapon. At issue was whether the State had failed to meet its burden of proving the absence of a license for the weapon carried by defendants in the assault upon the victims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim answered a knock at door of the apartment he shared with his father. One defendant grabbed him and pulled out a gun. An altercation ensued involving the victim, his father, the two defendants, and others. The victim and his father were seriously injured. Defendants were convicted and appealed, arguing that the State had impermissibly shifted its burden of proof to them with respect to the charge of carrying a weapon without a license. The court distinguished between the evidentiary burden of production and the burden of proof. The court stated that the burden of proof was always upon the State, but that the burden of going forward with evidence could shift to defendant once the State adduced a prima facie case. The court noted that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-47-27 prohibited the carrying of a pistol without a license and created an inference that carrying such weapon was unlawful, thereby shifting to defendants the burden of introducing evidence of the existence of a license. The court held that where a legislative provision did not shut out a defendant from submitting his defense to a jury, there was no ground for holding that it denied him due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendants' convictions.</SPAN></P>

The Commission denied the proposed tariff and ordered the company to submit new tariffs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On certiorari the company contended that the Commission failed to allow for the recovery of certain of its capital investments through depreciation and amortization, the Commission incorrectly calculated its working capital requirements, and the Commission erroneously used a purchased-gas refund from the company's suppliers to reduce the company's operating expenses. The attorney general objected to the Commission's allowance of an attrition adjustment and the treatment of the company's deferred tax obligation. The court held that the Commission's decision to disallow any amortization of the deficiency was reasonable. Having determined that the cost of the depreciation had been recovered, the Commission properly removed it from the rate base. The court also noted that the Commission was not bound by the methodology employed in considering prior applications and it was reasonable for the Commission to attempt to reach an equitable result by reducing the company's general purchased-gas expense by the amount of a refund. However, the record did not support the Commission's finding that an attrition adjustment was essential to compensate the company for any erosion of earnings.</SPAN></P>

The detainees were arrested and taken to the police station where they were detained until early the next morning. A trial court dismissed the charges of disorderly conduct, and the detainees brought suit based on malicious prosecution and false imprisonment. The trial court ruled in favor of the lieutenant, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The ordinance under which the detainees were charged was properly admitted into evidence where it was presumptively valid for law enforcement purposes. Further, it was not unreasonable for the lieutenant to have relied upon the ordinance as supplying probable cause to charge the detainees. Finally, the denial of the detainees' motion for a directed verdict on the issue of liability was proper where the reasonableness of the lieutenant's actions was for a jury to decide.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of information obtained from an eyewitness, defendant was arrested in connection with the shooting death of a fish vendor. Police officers testified that defendant was informed of his Miranda rights at the police station and then asserted his willingness to speak. Thereafter, defendant gave and signed a partial confession. When he then expressed a desire to be represented by counsel the interrogation ceased. In support of his motion to suppress the confession, defendant contended that he was not given his Miranda rights as claimed by police, and that he was kicked, beaten, and otherwise coerced into signing the confession. The trial judge found that defendant's testimony wholly lacked credibility and that the bruises on defendant were not linked in any persuasive way with actions by the police. The court affirmed and held that those findings were not clearly erroneous in light of the testimony at the suppression hearing. The court further held that defendant's testimony that he was mellow but knew everything that was going on, despite having ingested various toxicants, buttressed the trial judge's finding that the confession was voluntary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner challenged the decision of the Superior Court (Rhode (Island) that granted defendant redevelopment agency's motion, brought pursuant to R.I. Super Ct. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), to dismiss the landowner's action for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The landowner sought to recover damages to its real estate and its business caused by the condemnation of land adjacent to its real estate by the agency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner alleged that the agency's actions in condemning adjacent land, leveling it, and leaving it barren resulted in a constructive taking of its real estate without just compensation in violation of the U.S. Const. amend. V and XIV and R.I. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment with directions. The court explained that, pursuant to the federal constitution, a change in the character of a neighborhood without any interference with a plaintiff's interest in or control over his property was not a taking and that loss of customers was not a taking of property even though it might have resulted in a loss of land value. Similarly, the court noted that where no land was physically taken and no interest in it which the law recognized was extinguished or affected in a manner detrimental to the owner, the prohibition contained in the Rhode Island Constitution against the taking of property without just compensation did not apply. The court concluded by stating that an abutting landowner had no property right in the traffic flow and that any diminution in value of his property resulting solely from a diversion of traffic was not compensable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment with respect to the landowner's claim that the actions of the agency resulted in a constructive taking of its real estate.

The district court certified the questions presented for resolution. The court declined to rule on the federal constitution question, concluding that the interpretation of the federal constitution was the duty of the district court. However, the court held that the act did not violate R.I. Const. art. XII because safety was a religiously neutral concept and providing safe transportation for all pupils was a legitimate function of the governmental police power. The act did not contravene R.I.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff promoters appealed from the judgments of the superior court (Rhode Island) dismissing their complaints against defendants, a town council, a town treasurer, an entertainment venue company and its owner, seeking damages for the nonperformance of a music festival. The venue company and its owner also appealed from the trial court's dismissal of its cross-claim against the town council.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The entertainment venue company and its owner applied for a license for the promoters' music festival. The town treasurer negotiated the license fee check, but the town council denied the license. The promoters then filed suit against the town council, the venue company and its owner alleging that the town council illegally denied the license and that the venue owner misrepresented to them that the license had been issued. The promoters also filed a separate suit against the town treasurer. The venue company and owner filed a cross-claim against the town council. The trial court granted the town council's and the treasurer's motions to dismiss pursuant to R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). On the consolidated appeals, the court held that the complaints stated valid claims against the town council and the treasurer, noting that the complaints alleged that the promoters authorized the venue company to submit the application as its agent. Thus, the promoters had standing to sue the town council. The court also held that the trial court improperly dismissed the venue company's cross-claim because it made a decision on the merits based on matters outside of the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgments of the trial court dismissing the promoters' complaints against the town council, the town treasurer, the entertainment venue company and its owner. The court also reversed the trial court's judgment dismissing the venue company's and owner's cross-claim against the town council. The court remanded the cases for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Indictments were returned by a statewide grand jury against defendants on charges pending in two counties. Defendants challenged the constitutionality of the composition and operation of the grand jury, which was convened pursuant to R. I. Gen. Laws tit. 12, ch. 11.1 (1956), as enacted by 1974 R.I. Pub. Laws ch. 221, &sect; 4. A judge in one county certified three questions regarding the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the statewide system, the grand jury sat in one city and heard evidence regarding crimes allegedly committed by defendants in the two counties. It then met in each of those two counties and returned indictments against defendants. The certified questions dealt with whether the procedure used satisfied due process and whether the fact that professors, tutors, and students of recognized universities had been excluded from the jury pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;9-9-3 was unconstitutional. A judge in the second county had denied defendants motions to dismiss their indictments. The court answered only one certified question, holding that use of the &sect; 9-9-3 exemption to exclude certain persons from the grand jury pool violated due process. Both petit and grand juries were to be taken from a fair cross-section of the population. While certain exemptions from service could be allowed without violating either the Sixth or Fourteenth Amendments, use of an exemption to completely exclude a class of people from a jury pool was improper. The court did not address the propriety of the motion to dismiss because the denial was an interlocutory order not properly before the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered one of the three certified questions, ruling that the statewide grand jury was composed in violation of constitutional requirements, so that defendants' indictments could not stand.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 5-22-1, 5-22-2, 5-22-4 (1956).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the town's ordinance and R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 5-22-1, 5-22-2, 5-22-4 (1956), the corporation attempted to obtain a license for a concert. The license was denied because a prior concert had resulted in personal abuses, threats, noise, extreme physical exhaustion, invasion of and damage to property, traffic tie-ups, and general filth. When the corporation stated that it would hold the concert without a license, the town and the resident sought an injunction. After the trial court granted the injunction, review was sought. Upon review, the court held that even though the power to enjoin an ordinance's violation was not enumerated in R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 45-6-2 (1956), a municipality could seek an injunction in equity when the violation of an ordinance also constituted a nuisance. The court also held that even though equity courts lacked criminal jurisdiction and that equity would not enjoin acts merely because they were punishable as crimes, the injunction was proper because both criminal law and equitable obligations were involved. Finally, the court found competent evidence that the resident would suffer immediate and irreparable harm without the injunction.</SPAN></P>

The applicant asserted that she had the right to change her name without presenting a court decree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant was formerly married and used her husband's surname. After her divorce, she resumed the use of her birth name. When she attempted to change her name on her Rhode Island driver's license, the registry of motor vehicles insisted that she provide either a divorce decree granting her the use of her birth name or another legal document evidencing her name change. She brought an action against the registrar, seeking a declaration of her right to change her name. The trial court decreed that she had to use her Christian name and her husband's name in applying for an operator's license. She appealed, and the court reversed. It explained that, absent legislation to the contrary, all citizens in Rhode Island had a common-law right to use, assume, and adopt any name as long as the purpose of its assumption or adoption was not fraudulent. It, thus, held that the trial court had erred both in finding that a married woman's legal name had to be her first name with her husband's surname and in sustaining the policy of the registry of motor vehicles to that effect.</SPAN></P>

The questions certified were based on defendant's motion to dismiss an indictment on the ground that the statute was constitutionally vague and the statutory exemptions violated equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were indicted for knowingly possessing obscene material for the purpose of sale and exhibition in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-31-1. Defendants moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the statute was void for impermissible vagueness and overbreadth on regulating materials contrary to the specificity required by the First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment. Defendants also argued that the statute failed the notice requirements of Due Process and the provisions of R.I. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10. Specifically, defendant asserted that the statute did not define &quot;obscene.&quot; Defendants also contended that the exemptions set forth in R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-31-15 denied defendants equal protection. The court held that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-31-1 must be construed in accordance with the relevant Supreme Court decisions, which provided standards for what constituted obscene materials and that, therefore, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The court also concluded that the exemptions provided in R.I. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered the case remanded to the trial court for further proceedings and certified its decision that the statute under which defendants were indicted was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad as the term &quot;obscene&quot; was sufficiently defined by the case law and that the exemptions to the statute did not violate equal protection where there was a rational basis for the classification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried and convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment. On appeal, defendant asserted that R.I. Gen.

Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Defendant alleged that the right of allocution provided for more than the procedural opportunity to speak prior to the imposition of sentencing, such as the right to unfettered judicial discretion in the sentencing process. The court held that R.I. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 did not vest the judiciary the power to fashion discretionary sentences independently, therefore, &sect; 12-19-11 was not violative of the right of allocution under &sect; 10. The court also ruled that the mandatory life sentence attached to &sect; 12-19-11 was not considered cruel and unusual under the analysis that a crime was cruel or unusual when it was grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in the family court with five delinquency petitions.

The State filed an information in the trial court. The trial court dismissed, finding that &sect; 14-1-7.1 was unconstitutional for failing to provide reasonable guidelines for its application.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer worked an extra-duty job at a grocery. He was observed leaving the store with items he had not paid for, and an employee of the store was observed loading other items that he had taken into the police officer's vehicle. The chief of police dismissed the officer. The officer appealed to the director of public safety and city personnel board, both of which affirmed the chief's action. The officer appealed to the superior court, which held a trial de novo and affirmed the personnel board's decision. The court granted the officer's petition for a writ of certiorari and affirmed the superior court's decision. There was competent evidence on the record that supported the discharge. The city rules were not unconstitutionally vague, and the penalty was reasonable. For an experienced police officer to suggest that the phrases &quot;conduct unbecoming an officer&quot; and &quot;conduct tending to cast disrepute on the department&quot; did not give him reasonable notice that activities such as larceny and receiving stolen goods fell within their ambit was unconvincing. The action was civil and the offenses, although criminal, could be established by the preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The Commission forwarded a financial statement form to the member requesting personal financial information. The member responded by filing a request for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the member, finding that the redevelopment agency was not a part of state or municipal government and that the member could not have been considered to be a state or municipal appointed official. On appeal, the Commission argued that the redevelopment agency was part of a state or municipal government pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 36-14-3(2). The court examined the legislative intent of the statute and concluded that the phrase &quot;state or municipal government&quot; did not include members of redevelopment agencies. The court found that the legislature viewed the redevelopment agencies as separate and distinct entities regarding conflicts of interest. The member was not required to have filed financial statements with the Commission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband had been ordered to pay child support under URESA. He was later found in arrears. The family court subsequently found that he was in contempt for failure to pay the counsel fees ordered in the arrearage determination. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that at the time the attorney fee decrees were entered, the family court had jurisdiction both of the parties and of the subject matter. The court reasoned that the family court had the right to consider the question of contempt and also had the right to consider the entry of an order for counsel fees by way of purging the husband from contempt. The court found that the family court's jurisdiction was not subject to review because a claim that a judge exceeded his jurisdiction did not suffice to show a clear absence of jurisdiction over the subject matter required to impose civil liability in damages. The court concluded that there was no error in holding the husband in contempt because the evidence supported that he failed to comply with valid and specific court orders without establishing inability to perform or some other justification for noncompliance.</SPAN></P>

He then appealed the trial court's denial of his petition for habeas corpus. While moot, the court entertained the appeal as a matter of public interest and affirmed, holding that evidence, even though illegally obtained, was admissible at a bail revocation hearing if it was factually reliable; in other words, such evidence could, where relevant and reliable, serve as the evidence required to reasonably satisfy that there had been a violation.</SPAN></P>

On review, defendant argued that that the trial court erred when he advised the jury that it was defendant's burden to establish his intoxication by a preponderance of the evidence. The court found that it was the prosecution's burden to prove every fact essential to the offense and that specific intent to steal was an essential element of robbery. Furthermore, drunkenness could negate the specific intent. The court concluded that the trial court should have instructed the jury that the prosecution was required to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant was not so intoxicated as to be unable to form the specific intention to steal. Finally, the court found that the jury instruction was improper even though defendant never objected to the instruction in the trial court because defendant's constitutional rights were at issue. Therefore, the trial court's decision was reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city police chief recommended the dismissal of a police officer after he was allegedly involved in an incident that occurred at a bar. The mayor approved the recommendation. A hearing committee that was appointed pursuant to the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights, imposed a 15-day suspension on the police officer. The mayor filed a writ of certiorari seeking review of the committee's decision. Upon review, the court denied and dismissed the petition for certiorari. The court found it had the power to review the committee's decision where under R.I. Const. art. XII, it had the authority to exercise final revisory and appellate jurisdiction upon all questions of law and equity. The court held the mayor could challenge the constitutionality of the Officers' Bill of Rights even though he chose to proceed under the statute because he was clearly not a member of the class benefited or protected by the statute. The court determined the Officers' Bill of Rights was not unconstitutional on the basis that it delegated an executive function where the mayor failed to assert the statute lacked sufficient standards to guide the hearing committee in the exercise of its authority.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that, although the arresting officers possessed information that would have warranted a man of reasonable caution to believe that defendant had been driving under the influence of alcohol, the record was insufficient to establish that he fled the crime scene. The court also opined that the warrantless administration of the breathalyzer test violated defendant's Fourth Amendment rights because the implied consent exception in R.I. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the committee reorganized the school and abolished several departmental chairmanship positions, the union claimed that because the teachers who had been chairmen had received extra pay, the positions' abolition was a term or condition of employment under &sect; 28-9.3-2 and was subject to mandatory bargaining. When the Board found the committee guilty of an unfair labor practice, the committee refused to negotiate with the union. Thereafter, the superior court reversed, holding that the reorganization was not a mandatory subject of collective bargaining but was a matter of educational policy within the committee's jurisdiction under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 16-2-18. Accordingly, the Board and the union sought a writ of certiorari. In granting the writ and reversing, the court held that even though the bargaining agreement had expired, a dismissal for mootness was improper because a dismissal would unjustly reward the committee for its refusal to comply with the Board's order. After holding that the Board was a proper party, the court also held that because the positions' abolition concerned both a management question and an employment condition, the committee had a duty to negotiate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded nolo contendere to an indictment charging him with breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny. He received a 2-year suspended sentence and was placed on probation for 2 years. About 9 months later, he rang the doorbell of a residence at which the police had just made a narcotics arrest. A police officer opened the door and ordered defendant to enter. He was searched, and a revolver was found in his pocket. Probation violation charges were filed against him, as well as a new charge of carrying a pistol without a license. The new charge was dismissed because the gun was the product of an illegal search. The trial court refused, however, to apply the exclusionary rule at the violation hearing and defendant's probation was revoked. On appeal, the court held that there was no indication in the legislature's enactment of the statutory exclusionary rule, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 9-19-25, of whether it intended such rule to extend to probation revocation hearings, and the court refused to so extend the rule. The court held that the legislature had the power to expand the rule to such hearings, if its reading of the legislative purpose was inaccurate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A juvenile appealed from a judgment of a Rhode Island Family Court, which found him to be a delinquent and wayward child by reason of possession of stolen goods. The juvenile sought release pending appeal and, when his motion was denied, obtained release by a separate action for habeas corpus, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 14-1-53. He alleged that the stolen goods were illegally seized.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first determined that the juvenile did not have a constitutional right to release pending appeal, under either the Federal or the Rhode Island Constitution. The sole method of release under Rhode Island law was &sect; 14-1-53. The court suggested to the legislature that it was ill equipped to make such decisions, which in adult cases were made by the trial court. The juvenile was charged with possession of stolen goods when a stolen camera was found in his room pursuant to a search consented to by his stepfather. They told the stepfather that they were searching for different items taken in a different housebreaking. The juvenile contended that the search was beyond the scope of the consent. The trial court held that the consent was general. The court disagreed and remanded for the trial court to determine the extent of the consent actually given. The state contended that even if the search went beyond the scope of the consent, it was justified by the plain view exception. The court noted that the officers could not tell that the camera was stolen until they looked inside the case and found someone else's name.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the appeal and reversed the judgment of the family court. It remanded for the trial court to determine whether the seizure of the camera was outside the scope of the consent given and, if so, whether it was justified under the plain view or any other exception to the requirement of a warrant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State brought a consolidated enforcement action against the landowners seeking injunctive and mandatory relief along with a civil penalty because the landowners violated the act by altering fresh water wetland without the approval of the appropriate department as required by R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 2-1-21 (1956). Each landowner was filling an area that was designated a wetland under the act. The trial court determined that the act was unconstitutional and entered judgment for the landowners, but on appeal, the court reversed and ordered a new trial. The court concluded that the State met its difficult burden of showing that the subject property was a wetland using the positive, uncontroverted testimony of two witnesses. Because the trial court did not specifically reject the truthfulness of that testimony, the testimony was conclusive, and the properties were deemed wetlands. Furthermore, the city was in possession of photographs that identified the subject property as wetlands, and each landowner had received written notice of that fact. The landowners failed to introduce any evidence showing that the act deprived them of all use of their property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of violating R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-11-5 (1969 Reenactment), which prohibited profane swearing and cursing, and defendant appealed, claiming that the statute was void for vagueness and impinged upon his First Amendment right of free speech. The court sustained defendant's appeal and vacated his conviction, holding that although the statute's constitutionality was preserved, its narrow proscription could not be applied to defendant's language because even if his message to his cohorts regarding police officers constituted profanity under the statute, there was no evidence to suggest that his message was directed at a certain officer. The court found that given the commonly understood and established meaning of the word &quot;profane,&quot; the use of the term in the statute was a sufficient warning to protect defendant's due process rights. Moreover, the court concluded that under a &quot;fighting words&quot; analysis, the words of defendant for which the state sought punishment were neither intended to incite acts of violence nor spoken as personally abusive epithets and thus constituted protected speech under the First Amendment, entitling defendant to an acquittal.</SPAN></P>

In regard to the last contention, the employee argued the charter provisions were overly broad because they purported to regulate protected as well as unprotected conduct; in effect, they prohibited city employees from holding any elective office, partisan and nonpartisan, on the state, local, and federal level.

The administrator determined that manufacturing molds used by the taxpayer were not exempt from taxation as tangible personal property under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-18-30(H) (1970). A superior court (Rhode Island) reversed the administrator's judgment in part. Both parties filed petitions for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer used specially designed injection molds in its manufacturing business. The parties agreed that, if the molds were used continuously, at full production, they would deteriorate and be unusable within a year. All but two of the taxpayer's molds became economically useless within a year, but they were not otherwise deteriorated to the point of being physically useless. The administrator refused to allow a tax exemption for any of the molds; he interpreted &sect; 44-18-30(H) to provide an exemption only for molds that became physically unfit within a year. The trial court reversed the determination, holding that the molds that were economically used up within a year were covered by the &sect; 44-18-30(H) exemption. The parties' certiorari petitions were consolidated on appeal. In reversing in part, the court held that &sect; 44-18-30(H) was unambiguous; it allowed an exemption only if an item was physically, rather than economically, unfit for use within one calendar year. Tax regulations which conflicted with the statute's language were void. A penalty could have been assessed under R.I. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">License applicants filed suit against a licensing board alleging certain rules promulgated by the licensing board were invalid. The applicants were residents of Massachusetts and had been duly examined and issued hoisting engineers' licenses by that state and applied to the board for similar licensure in Rhode Island.

The court reversed the superior court's declaratory judgment grant for the board and held that the board's rule providing for oral examinations which made no provision for recording of questions and answers violated the applicants' U.S. Const. amend. XIV due process rights. The court found the applicants had a strong interest in having a record kept of the questions and answers of each oral examination and the countervailing governmental interests were insubstantial in comparison with the interests of the applicants. The additional administrative effort involved in keeping a record would not be unduly burdensome. The court held the licensing board's restriction on the ability of aliens to become licensed hoisting engineers was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyers all arranged the erection of modular homes on land they owned for sale as completed houses. When the modules arrived at the prepared sites, the buyers were responsible for completing the construction work on them. By agreement, the modules were considered personal property belonging to the manufacturer until payment was received. The Administrator found that the modules did not become part of the real estate until the buyers combined them with other components to complete construction of the houses, and as personal property, they were subject to the use tax. The buyers brought actions against the Administrator challenging his assessment of the use taxes under &sect; 44-18-20. The trial court affirmed the assessments, holding that the modules were tangible personal property subject to the tax because they could have been removed without damage to the realty before the construction was completed. The buyers appealed and the cases were consolidated. The court affirmed, and dismissed the appeals, holding that the buyers, as any construction contractor, were liable for the use tax on materials they purchased from an out-of-state supplier for use in the state to erect houses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the Rhode Island Bar Association, sought to suspend respondent attorney for nonpayment of the bar association dues. The attorney's first suit was dismissed in the U.S. District Court, and affirmed in the First Circuit. He refused to pay and he was ordered suspended unless he paid. He paid. Again, he refused to pay the following year and challenged the validity of the Unification Order of the State Bar Association.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney contended that the Bar Association was a state agency within the meaning of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) but the court held that it was not an &quot;agency&quot; subject to the APA. An agency described by the APA was a governmental entity, apart from the judicial or legislative branches, which was created by statute, executive order, or the Constitution and which could affect the rights of private parties either through adjudication or rulemaking. Although the Bar Association could regulate its internal affairs to some extent, it was not empowered to determine contested cases or to make rules affecting the rights and obligations of its members without the court's approval. Therefore, it was not an agency. The dues did not constitute an unconstitutional tax. The required dues were not a tax designed to raise revenue, but a licensing fee. The unification of the Bar Association was not violative of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. The Bar Association's fee was hardly price-fixing of services. Lastly, the dues did not constitute a &quot;debt&quot; to the Bar Association discharged in bankruptcy. The dues owed the Bar Association were a continuing obligation of its members.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the motion of the Bar Association that the attorney be suspended from membership and the practice of law for failure to comply with the bylaws of the association, in that he failed to pay his dues, be granted, unless the attorney paid his due within 15 days after the filing of the opinion.</SPAN></P>

The operator claimed that it violated equal protection and due process principles. The trial court upheld the statute. In affirming the decision, the court found the statute constitutional. The statute only imposed a tax on racing events that pari-mutuel betting was permitted. The court found that the legislature's distinction between betting and non-betting activities was justified because of the well-known dangers and possibilities of abuses that attend gambling. Racing events had a long history in the state, so the court reasoned that a tax on jai alai admissions was probably premature. The tax was not arbitrary or an irrational exercise of the legislative power.</SPAN></P>

Laws &sect; 11-10-1 (1969 Reenactment), failed to describe the forbidden acts explicitly by using the term &quot;abominable and detestable crime against nature,&quot; and was so vague and uncertain as to violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court disagreed. A fundamental principle of due process was that a state could not hold an individual criminally responsible for conduct, which he could not reasonably understand to be proscribed. A statute challenged on grounds of impermissible vagueness should not, however, be tested for constitutional specificity in a vacuum, but should instead be judged in light of its common law meaning, its statutory history, and prior judicial interpretations of its particular terms. In a previous case, fellatio was held to fall within the statutory proscription. Thus, when defendant committed fellatio, he was on clear notice that his conduct was criminal under the statute as construed. The court held that he was foreclosed from asserting a lack of fair warning as a defense to his prosecution for that crime. The controlling statute satisfied the due process requirements of clarity and specificity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with receipt of stolen goods, arraigned, and given bail. At that point, the state moved under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 46(g) to revoke bail on a previous set of indictments. Defendant was held for two weeks without bail, pending a hearing on the state's motion. After the hearing, personal recognizance was revoked, and defendant was committed to a correctional institution. Defendant then petitioned the court for a writ of habeas corpus. Subsequently, he pleaded nolo contendere to three charges and was sentenced and released. The court ruled that although the habeas corpus issue was technically mooted by defendant's release from jail, it was properly justiciable. The court granted habeas corpus pro forma and held, inter alia, that: (1) the trial court had inherent authority to revoke bail, and this action did not constitute preventive detention; (2) a two-week delay, absent a defendant's consent, between defendant's detention and the revocation hearing was not to be countenanced; and (3) the standard of proof for bail revocation hearings was one which required the state to go beyond probable cause and afforded defendant the necessary due process.</SPAN></P>

The town then sought an injunction, and the trial court ordered the landowner to remove the trailer from his property. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court properly refused to address the landowner's constitutional issues because they were presented in a vague and unclear manner. The constitutional issues were also not reviewable on appeal because they were not raised at trial. Also, the court held that the town did not act in an arbitrary manner in seeking an injunction to enforce its zoning ordinance. Further, the landowner failed to take the procedural steps necessary by applying for a zoning certificate, and the trailer clearly violated the town's zoning laws because only one residential structure per lot was permitted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner city brought a certiorari proceeding to have the legality of an amendment to both the policemen's and the firefighters' pension funds reviewed. The amendments were ordered by respondents, the firefighters' and the policemen's arbitration boards, and supported by respondent unions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its petition, the city argued that (1) the arbitration boards lacked jurisdiction to change the pension plans; (2) the evidence and the facts found by the arbitration boards did not support the awards; (3) the awards illegally attempted to supersede the home rule charter of the city; and (4) the awards violated the Fire Fighters' Arbitration Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 28, ch. 9.1 (1956) and the Policemen's Arbitration Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 28, ch. 9.2 (1956), (Arbitration Acts), in that they created a contract for more than one year. Upon review, the court agreed with the city's fourth contention. Under the terms of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 28-9.1-6 (1956), the city could not have been bound for a period in excess of one year. The problem in the instant case arose because in granting the unions' request to abolish the age requirement for retirement on a pension, the arbitration boards attempted to soften the impact by introducing the changes gradually over a five-year period. However, there was no practical difficulty in severing the void part of the award and giving effect to the provisions relating to the first year of the contract.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the close of the landowner's case, the town sought an involuntary dismissal under R.I. Super. R. Civ. P. 41(b)(2), on the ground that the landowner had not established facts upon which relief could be granted. The trial court granted the motion. The principal issues presented for review were whether the town council gave sufficient notice of the proposed amendment, whether the amendment was made in accordance with the town's comprehensive plan, and whether R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 45-24-4.1 (Reenactment 1970), as amended, which authorized conditional zoning by town or city councils, violated constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection. On appeal, the court upheld the validity of the statute and affirmed the superior court's judgment. In so ruling, the court determined that notice of the proposed amendment, which alerted the landowner that the proposed amendment would affect property very close to his own, was properly given. The court further ruled that the amendment conformed to the plan because it bore a reasonable relationship to the public health, safety, and welfare.</SPAN></P>

The manufacturer testified that certain parts of six machines assembled for resale and shipped to a customer in Canada were listed on the manufacturer's tax return as depreciable assets. The court held that: (1) legislation would not be held unconstitutional if there were reasonable classifications of the kind of property subjected to tax; (2) &sect; 44-18-30(H) exempted from use tax personal property consumed directly in manufacturing of goods for sale if the consumption occurred within one year from the date of first use; (3) the allowance of a use tax exemption for dies consumed within one year was a reasonable time limitation; and (4) because the machines built for resale were treated as depreciable assets on the manufacturer's tax return, they were considered personal property rather than as inventory, and therefore subject to the use tax.</SPAN></P>

The employee lived in the town of Lincoln, which was only minutes away from East Providence.

Section 9-14-3 required all employees to become city residents within six months after they commenced their employment. The trial court affirmed the dismissal, and the employee appealed. The court denied and dismissed the employee's appeal. The court found that the city's residency requirement did not affect the employee's right to travel. In addition, the city was not estopped from enforcing the ordinance as to the employee simply because the city gave the employee longer than six months to make the move. The court concluded that the right to travel interstate did not include the right to live in one city and simultaneously demand employment of another.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient alleged that he grew ill as a result of exposure to toxic chemical fumes in the course of his employment with a company.

The patient filed an action for medical malpractice against the doctor and later filed an amended complaint in an attempt to join five other defendants whom he alleged were part of the conspiracy. The five defendants brought motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), which was granted. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court determined that none of the acts allegedly committed by the later-added defendants took place within the two year statute of limitations under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 9-1-14 (1969), thus, the patient was barred from an action against the later-added defendants. The court also held that because the patient was fully aware of his alleged injuries and the alleged efforts of defendants to conceal their cause, he was unable to rely upon R.I. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The notice of the proposed ordinance was published several times in a local newspaper.

The notice of hearing was reasonable and well within the rule. The court modified the rule for requiring publication of the notice of a hearing and found that the notice only needed to indicate that a comprehensive revision was to take place, advised persons where a map of the proposed rezoning could be examined, and indicated that the proposal could be changed due to further study or the views expressed at the hearing. The court also found that the hearing was fair and that the town council had not predetermined their position. The fairness test was whether a person could conclude that everyone in all fairness had been heard and the legislative body gave reasonable credit to all matters presented.</SPAN></P>

The matter arose after the Director rejected the property owners' application to alter fresh water wetlands by relocating a river, in reliance upon the Fresh Water Wetlands Act, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 2-1-18 through 2-1-24 (1956).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners brought the action to establish their rights under the Act after the Director denied their application to relocate a river. The superior court granted the Director's motion for summary judgment and the property owners appealed. The court affirmed, first finding that it would apply the amendments to the Act, which became effective after the superior court decision but before the appeal. The court then held that the purpose and policy contained in the Act adequately limited the discretion of the Director; therefore, the Act did not violate R.I. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 1, 2 in granting authority to the Director to disapprove applications to alter fresh water wetlands. Further, the delegation of authority to municipalities to disapprove the applications properly was limited by the same standards that governed the Director. The authority delegated to towns, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 2-1-21 (1956), also was not unconstitutional on its face as a denial of substantive or procedural due process. The court also ruled that the Act did not deny the property owners equal protection of law and that &sect; 2-1-21(b) did not deprive them of property without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction for unlawfully accepting a gift and gratuity from the witness to influence improperly the conduct of defendant. He first argued that the State had failed to prove an essential element of the charge, namely, any intent on the part of the witness to improperly influence defendant's conduct by gift or gratuity. The court rejected defendant's first argument, finding nothing in the language of &sect;11-7-10 prescribing the time when the gift or gratuity must have been made. However, there was competent evidence in the record to support the trial justice's finding that the $ 200 payment was made with intent to influence defendant's conduct, even though the money was paid to defendant after all the horses were &quot;hit.&quot; The court found no error in the denial of defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal. Defendant also contented that the trial justice erred in denying the motion to dismiss on the ground that &sect; 11-7-10 was unconstitutionally vague. The court disagreed, finding the words of the statute were sufficiently clear to apprise an individual of the activities proscribed thereby. Defendant's appeal was denied and dismissed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the trial court's judgment was improper. The court looked to the legislative purpose behind R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 28-14-2 (1956) to determine whether it was constitutional. The court noted that the R.I. Constitution did not prohibit imprisonment for debt, rather, it prohibited the continuation of imprisonment for debt unless there was a strong presumption of fraud. The court determined that the statute was enacted to implement a criminal procedure designed to promote the social and economic welfare of the community. The court found that the creation of the criminal sanction was reasonably related to the achievement of the recognized public benefit resulting from prompt payment of wages.

Moreover, the food products actually used for animal consumption were not exempt. The court concluded that that there was no limitation period established for cases involving a failure to file a return, and, therefore, there was no legal impediment by way of time limitation on the tax administrator to audit for the six-year period.

Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 12(c), for plaintiff city housing authority in its action to regain possession of the leased premises.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenant allowed the stipulated rental to remain in arrears for more than 15 days and did not petition a board of tenants' affairs for a hearing or review of the matter. At trial, the tenant sought to excuse her rent default on the grounds that she had experienced unusual financial difficulties. She also claimed to have tendered overdue rent and further asserted that she was ready to pay both the arrearages and the then-current rental. The court, in affirming the trial court's judgment, found that the housing authority had a statutory right, under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 34-18-9 (1956), as amended by 1970 R.I. Pub. Laws ch. 7, &sect; 2, to regain possession of the leased premises for the tenant's failure to pay rent within 15 days after it was due. The court noted that, while &sect; 34-18-9 did not provide for automatic forfeiture of the lease, it did expressly provide for a right of repossession. Therefore, reasoning that a tender of overdue rent by a delinquent tenant after eviction proceedings had commenced would have abrogated the housing authority's right to repossession upon the tenant's nonpayment of rent, the court refused to apply principles of equity to provide relief for the tenant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied and dismissed the tenant's appeal, affirmed the trial court's judgment granting the housing authority possession of the leased premises, and remitted the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that it was error for the trial court to determine the narcotic qualities of a proscribed drug rather than in submitting the issue to the jury, asserted that the statutory classification of cannabis as a narcotic was unconstitutional, and contended that the exclusion of certain evidence was prejudicial. The court disagreed. The court stated that defendant based his motion to dismiss the indictment on the basis that cannabis was neither psychologically nor pharmacologically a narcotic and hence the statutory classification of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 21-28-2(15) (1968), was inaccurate and unconstitutional. The determination of this particular issue was a matter of law and thus within the province of the trial justice to decide. It was the court's view that as the legislature could reasonably have classified marijuana as a proscribed narcotic, therefore, its action was reasonable, and a rational basis existed for the classification. In addition, defendant had not met the burden of demonstrating unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt and of rebutting the presumption in favor of the facts found by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a civil action involving the construction of a will, plaintiff, a judgment creditor of a residual beneficiary under the will, challenged the decision of a superior court (Rhode Island), which ruled that the devise to the beneficiary was general in nature, meaning that the land could be sold pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 33-12-6 (1969), thereby defeasing the beneficiary's title to the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The testator's will granted the residue of the testator's estate to the beneficiary and the testator's other child in equal shares. A probate court granted the beneficiary, in his capacity as executor under the will, authority to sell the interest of the testator in certain real estate for the purpose of effecting a prompt and efficient settlement of the estate. The beneficiary's interest was sold, then resold, and the judgment creditor brought the instant action against the final purchasers and their mortgagee, claiming an undivided one-half interest in fee. The court saw no evidence which would rebut the presumption of generalness and cause the residuary gift of real estate to be deemed specific in nature. Since the court found the clause to be general, no written consent was necessary under &sect; 33-12-6 before the property could be sold. Assuming that the attachment were valid, once the beneficiary as executor invoked the procedure of &sect; 33-12-6, the beneficiary's title to the property was defeased, and hence the attachment failed also. There was no longer any title, right, or interest in the beneficiary upon which to levy the attachment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment creditor's appeal was denied and dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court stated that the presiding trial justice did not decide that the ophthalmologists were proper parties to bring a class action in behalf of their patients. There being no ruling by the presiding justice, there was no ruling as to the ophthalmologists' standing that would have barred a determination of this question by the second justice who considered the second motion to dismiss. The court emphasized that the ophthalmologists had standing only because of their own injury. They did not satisfy the court's standing criteria based on any asserted injury to their patients. The court stressed that once their standing had been established, they might have presented the broader claims of the public at large. The ophthalmologists, because they were ophthalmologists, could not have qualified as patients and they were not, thus, a member of the class which they sought to represent. The court sustained in part and denied the organizations' and the ophthalmologists' appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court of Rhode Island, which overruled his demurrer on constitutional grounds to the indictment charging him with unlawfully, and without a license, carrying a pistol in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-47-8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended, among other things, that the legislation which made it unlawful for him to carry a pistol or revolver on his person, unless licensed to do so, infringed upon the right of self defense guaranteed to all persons by R. I. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. The court disagreed, finding that art. I, &sect; 23 in no sense assured a right of self defense. The issue was whether in assigning licensing authority under R.I. Const. arts. III, IV, the Legislature prescribed standards which clearly and reasonably limited the exercise of the assigned authority to the public safety and welfare sought to be served. The court found that to give operative effect to the law and to prevent it from becoming a nullity required a delegation of authority which, in this instance, the Legislature made to those who by reason of their training and experience and the facilities at their command were probably more competent than any others to exercise the delegated power. As such, it was clear to the court that the Legislature in assigning the licensing authority under the Firearms Act, 11 R.I. Laws ch. 47, did not unlawfully delegate its power or contravene art. III.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's sentence was stayed and the record was certified to the court pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 12-22-10 (1956) in order for the court to pass on the constitutionality of R.I. Gen.

Laws &sect; 12-22-10 (1956), and upon his conviction, the trial court certified the question regarding the constitutionality of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-32-1 (1956) to the court. Defendant contended that the statute had to provide that he either knew that the person obstructed was an officer or that he knowingly obstructed an officer. The court held that an indictment or complaint under R.I. Rev. Stat. ch. 227, &sect; 8 (1879) was fatally defective unless it averred that defendant knew that the officer was an officer when he obstructed him and that such an averment was still an essential element under the due process clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and of R.I. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Consequently, R.I. Gen.

The board approved the union's requests for increased salary and benefits, which led the City to file a declaratory judgment action seeking to declare the board's action null and void. The City also petitioned for certiorari to the court. The trial court granted the union's motion to dismiss the City's declaratory judgment action, and the court affirmed on appeal. The City alleged that the board's award was void for failure to comply with the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 42, ch. 35 (1956). The court determined that the board's award was immune from judicial scrutiny through the use of a declaratory judgment action because the board was not a state agency within the context of the APA. Further, because the Fire Fighters' Arbitration Act provided that the decision of a majority of the board was binding on both the City and the bargaining agent, the board's award was not subject to judicial review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant corporation appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court (Rhode Island), which ruled for plaintiff town, upholding a town ordinance and ordering the corporation to limit the number of mobile homes in his park to 30. The corporation had challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance and sought to restrain the town from interfering with its right to operate a mobile home park with more than 30 units.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town sought to enjoin the corporation from violating a zoning and a licensing ordinance limiting the number of mobile homes in its facility to 30. The corporation sought to enjoin the town's interference with the operation of its park containing more than 30 units. The trial court ordered the corporation to limit the number of homes to 30, but the court reversed the judgment, agreeing with the corporation that the ordinance was patently unconstitutional. The corporation's use of its property was subject to the town's legitimate use of its police power to protect public health and welfare, but a zoning limitation that was not reasonably related to that goal was invalid. The limitation was not grounded on the number of acres in the park but prohibited more than 30 homes whether they were located on 3 or 300 acres. The full provision limited mobile homes in the town to a total of 90, but it was utterly unreasonable to apply the same limit to three different parcels of land in three different areas. The apparent goal to limit school populations was not a proper function of a zoning ordinance. The town was also estoppel from claiming that the park was an illegal nonconforming use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the corporation's appeal and vacated the trial court's judgment for the town that enforced a zoning and licensing ordinance against the corporation limiting the number of mobile homes in its park. The court also remanded the case to the trial court to determine the proper number of allowable units, and it ruled that the trial court order preserving the status quo remained in effect pending resolution of the case.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was no legislation that implicitly granted the teachers the right to strike and that if the legislature wished to give such a right, it had to do so in clear and unmistakable language. The teachers were also not permitted to enjoy the advantages of the anti-injunction statute without express legislative action that allowed them to do so. However, the court quashed the ex parte temporary restraining order because any harm suffered in failing to begin the school year on the appointed day was not irreparable due to the flexibility in scheduling the calendar year that allowed for the missed day to be made up.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court had the power to waive the costs of appeal payable by an indigent defendant in an action for possession of tenements upon a satisfactory showing of indigence and a certificate of counsel attesting to the merits of the proposed appeal and declaring that, in his opinion, his client's contentions have merit and that the appeal was sought in good faith and not for the purposes of delay or harassment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant parked a motor vehicle in the middle of the street. A police officer that was patrolling the area and dressed in uniform told defendant not to park his car in the middle of the street or it would be towed. Defendant replied he was making a delivery and walked away. When the police officer proceeded to call for a tow truck, defendant went back to his car and drove away. Later that morning, defendant returned and again parked his car in the middle of the street and proceeded to make a delivery. The police officer told defendant to move his car or he would place him under arrest. When defendant did not move his car, the police officer placed him under arrest. The court held that &sect; 31-12-3, which provided that no person shall refuse to comply with a lawful order of a police officer with the authority to direct traffic,&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague. The court determined that &sect; 31-12-3 contained reasonable specificity for the prohibited conduct. The court also concluded that defendant's equal protection rights were not violated where other operators of other illegally parked cars in the area were not arrested because there was no intentional or purposeful discrimination.</SPAN></P>

The abolition of defendant's common-law right to resist an unlawful arrest was constitutionally permissible. However, R.I. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three towns were legally incorporated into a regional school district, with each town to bear a proportionate share of the expenses of running the district.

At the annual meeting of one of the three towns, the property voters voted not to appropriate funds for the vocational school. The regional district brought an action against the town treasurer and prevailed in the lower court. The town treasurer sought review. On review, the town treasurer first claimed that 1958 R. I. Pub. Laws ch. 55, the enabling act creating the district, constituted a denial of equal protection under the federal and state constitutions. The court rejected this argument and held that a municipality had no inherent right to invoke the equal protection clause. The court further supported the holding of the lower court that the town was guilty of laches for not objecting to the enabling act when it was proposed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court (Rhode Island), which found him guilty and fined him for violating Providence, R.I., Ordinances ch. 30 &sect;&sect; 10, 11 (1914). The ordinance prohibited, among other things, standing on a sidewalk and disturbing or annoying passers-by or persons residing or doing business in the vicinity thereof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two police officers responded to a complaint that a group of youths were congregating near a bus terminal. When they arrived, the officers saw 20 to 25 persons, including defendant, standing and talking in various groups. Some were on the sidewalk and they were interfering with and obstructing the free passage of pedestrians. The officers ordered them to disperse and warned them that they would be charged with &quot;loitering and loafing&quot; unless they dispersed. The officers left the scene. The officers returned. Defendant remained there talking to a companion. The officers arrested defendant and his companion. The superior court found that the ordinance was constitutional. The court held that: (1) the complaint charged defendant in a single count with obstructing the free passage for foot passengers and with disturbing and annoying passers-by and persons residing in the vicinity; (2) part of the ordinance was vague because it did not specify the type of conduct that would result in an arrest; the statute was vague; (3) the trial justice did not state whether he found defendant guilty of &quot;obstructing&quot; or of &quot;annoying and disturbing,&quot; therefore, defendant was entitled to a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant landlord appealed from a judgment of the superior court (Rhode Island) in a civil action for the alleged conversion of personal property in a landlord tenant dispute, following a jury in which a verdict was rendered for plaintiff tenant on her claim, and for the landlord on its counterclaim for unpaid rent. The trial court also denied the landlord's motion to alter the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A tenant rented an apartment from a landlord on a month-to-month basis. A representative of the landlord visited the premises and found that it was unoccupied and apparently abandoned. The landlord moved the tenant's belongings to a warehouse that it owned. The tenant stated that she left the premises because they were poorly heated and uninhabitable. The tenant filed a civil action against the landlord for the alleged conversion of her goods and personal belongings. A jury returned a verdict for the tenant on her claim and for the landlord on its counterclaim for unpaid rent. The landlord appealed from the trial court's denial of its motion to alter the judgment. The court held that the trial court erred when it did not instruct the jury about the landlord's rights when the rent went into arrears for more than 15 days. Furthermore, the trial court committed prejudicial error when it charged the jury that the removal of the tenant's property amounted to conversion as a matter of law, if the jury found that the tenant had not in fact abandoned the premises. Finally, the landlord lawfully repossessed the premises but was not entitled to retain the tenant's belongings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord's appeal from the judgment entered for the tenant was sustained; the judgment appealed from was reversed and the appeal from the judgment for rent plus interest denied. Similarly, the landlord's appeal from the denial of its motion to alter the judgment on rent was denied and dismissed. Finally, the case was remitted to the trial court for entry of a judgment for the landlord on the tenant's claim and on its counterclaim for rent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his petition, the candidate contended that the Board erred in disallowing signatures appearing on his nomination papers. Of these disallowed signatures, 124 were invalidated because the names appearing on the nomination papers differed in form from the names that appeared on the voting list as required by R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 17-14-8. The court held that the provisions of &sect; 17-14-8 were not arbitrary nor unreasonable in violation of the candidate's right to the due process clause under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court concluded that 42 U.S.C.S.&sect; 1971(a)(2)(B) did not apply as there was no evidence of disallowance of the disputed signatures because of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. Also, judicial remedies under this section were confined to the federal courts. The court held that it was duty bound to give due regard to the election laws of the state and to give them full force and effect. Accordingly, the court held that &sect; 17-14-8 admitted no room for the doctrine of substantial compliance. To hold otherwise would result in its emasculation and could wreak havoc on the state's elective processes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied and dismissed the candidate's petition for certiorari.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court treated plaintiffs' complaint as a motion for declaratory relief because it sought to enjoin defendants from interfering with the exhibition of motion picture films at plaintiffs' theatres and from arresting or prosecuting any of plaintiffs' employees for exhibiting the films without a license. Plaintiffs contended that the ordinance's requirement of separate licenses for secular days and Sundays was an unconstitutional prior restraint from the guaranteed expression of free speech. Plaintiffs asserted the guarantees of free speech on weekdays was equally applicable to Sundays. The court agreed that &sect; 5-22-8, which called for separate licenses vis-a-vis Sundays and secular days, was defective and reversed the judgment of the trial court as to that section only. The court held that if an exhibitor was interested in only showing on a Sunday, the licensing authority was authorized by &sect; 5-22-8 to issue the license requested. If, however, a license was sought for a specified number of days or weeks which encompassed a Sunday or Sundays, only a single exercise of prior restraint was permitted.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that a theory similar to res ipsa loquitur applied to obscenity cases where no evidence other than the presentation of the magazines was necessary to establish a violation of the statutory and constitutional standards.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fire Fighters' Arbitration Act, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 28-9.1 et seq. (1956), gave the firefighters of any city or town a right to bargain collectively with the city or town by which they were employed and in such collective bargaining to be represented by a bargaining agent: R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 28-9.1-4. Under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 28-9.1-5, the cities and towns were obligated to recognize a bargaining agent selected by the firefighters. On appeal from the trial court's grant of the city's request for injunctive relief to prevent any compulsory binding arbitration concerning a collective bargaining agreement, the court reversed. The court concluded that each member of boards of arbitration provided for under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 28-9.1-8 was a public officer and that collectively the officers constituted an administrative or governmental agency. The court noted that the provisions of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 28-9.1-9 established a fixed term and specific duties for the incumbent. The trial court erroneously found that the statutory delegation of legislative power was to private persons rather than to governmental bodies.</SPAN></P>

Const. amend. XIII. The voters requested, and the trial court granted a request to certify questions of doubt and importance to the court. The court declared that it would not thereafter entertain certification of questions under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 9-24-27 in declaratory judgment proceedings. The court answered the certified questions by declaring that the superior court should declare that: (1) R.I. Const. amend. XIII vested the General Assembly with exclusive jurisdiction over apportionment; (2) that the obligation to reapportion was mandatory whenever, after a federal or state census, it became apparent that the prevailing apportionment constituted a denial of equal protection; and (3) that such an obligation existed to reapportion in a manner to avoid invidious discrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought to acquire certain land for the establishment of an industrial park. Within the land sought to be acquired was the homeowners' home. The homeowners challenged the approval of the redevelopment plan on grounds that the enabling legislation was unconstitutional in that the statutory definition of an &quot;arrested blighted area&quot; set forth in R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 45-31-8(2) failed to contain any requirement that the conditions constitute a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare and thus permitted the expenditure of public money and the taking of property by eminent domain for a nonpublic purpose. On appeal, the court held that the homeowners' attack on the constitutionality of the legislative definition failed. The clearance, replanning, redevelopment, rehabilitation, and improvement of an &quot;arrested blighted area&quot; constituted a public use and was constitutionally permissible. Moreover, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 45-31-3 provided that the existence of a blighted and substandard area constituted a menace inimical to the public health. The planning commission's failure to comply with a 30-day time period for filing a report did not vitiate the approval of the plan.</SPAN></P>

The superior court dismissed the actions on the grounds that the applicable limitations period, under R.I. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners filed a complaint that challenged the validity of the taking of their property for redevelopment purposes and the legality of the city's adoption of the redevelopment plan, which included, upon acquisition of the property, to sell it to a redeveloper, who was to rehabilitate and restore the property. The owners contended that the taking was unconstitutional because it was arbitrary and capricious, in that they were willing and able to restore the building themselves in conformity with the plan, and the city did not follow the statutory procedural requirements and made an unlawful delegation of power to the redevelopment agency. The superior court dismissed the actions. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgments and held that the owners, who were present at the hearing on the adoption of the redevelopment plan, had failed to contest the validity of the proceedings and the adoption of the redevelopment plan within 30 days after the adoption of the plan as prescribed in the Redevelopment Act of 1956, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 45-32-22, and thus, their actions were time barred. The court held that since the actions were barred it did not need to decide the validity of the claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought to enjoin defendants from merging into a subsidiary corporation. The merger was to become effective if the plan received affirmative votes from each of the corporations' stockholders, which represented at least two-thirds of the shares of each class of its capital stock. The court dismissed plaintiffs' action. On appeal, plaintiffs contended that the purpose of the merger was to eliminate the priorities of the preferred stock with less than the unanimous consent of its holders. The court reviewed R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 7-5-2 to determine the validity of plaintiffs' contention and affirmed the lower court's decision. The court held that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 7-5-2 did not forbid a merger between a parent and a subsidiary corporation, even where the merger was solely for the purpose of obviating the necessity of the unanimous vote which was otherwise required in order to cancel the priorities of preferred shareholders.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws &sect; 31-26-4 (1956), which governed the duty of a driver of motor vehicle that collided with an unattended vehicle. Defendant took no exception to the superior court decision.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the statute was unconstitutional. The court disagreed. The court found, inter alia, that (1) the duty to leave a written explanation in the English language of a statement of the circumstances of the collision did not require a motorist colliding with an unattended vehicle to reduce to writing admissions of guilt, which could form the basis of prosecution for some other offense under the motor vehicle code act; (2) the statute merely required defendant to leave a statement of his participation in the accident and pertinent contact information; (3) knowledge was so essentially an element of the vehicular offense under &sect; 31-26-4 as to be necessarily implied if not expressed; and (4) it was elementary that one, who sought a judicial veto of an act of the legislature on constitutional grounds, had the burden of establishing that the provisions complained of were unconstitutional as to him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners operated a junkyard on their properties. The town passed a zoning ordinance that designated these properties for use as single-family residences only. The property owners argued that they were exempt from the zoning ordinance because their operation of the junkyard was a valid nonconforming use. The court rejected this argument because the property owners failed to comply with the Town of Scituate, R.I., junkyard ordinance, which required all junkyards to be licensed. Because the property owners had operated their junkyard illegally, it was not a nonconforming use. In construing the penalty clause of the junkyard ordinance, the court concluded that the use of the word &quot;and&quot; was a mistake and that the legislative council intended to use the word &quot;or;&quot; otherwise, the junkyard ordinance violated the enabling legislation contained at R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 5-21-1. The court only substituted the word because it was virtually certain that the legislative intent was materially served by the change. Finally, the definition of &quot;automobile junkyard&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague when given the required common sense and practical interpretation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

The board contended that the taxpayer failed to file a reasonably adequate account of all her ratable property as a condition precedent to bringing a suit for relief from an alleged overassessment.

Pub. Laws 174. The State planned to pay for the land with the proceeds of the sale of bonds as authorized by 1964 R.I. Pub. Laws 169, and approved by vote of the people at a general election. The owners contended that the proposition approved by the voters did not inform them of the nature and extent of the State borrowing authorized by 1964 R.I. Pub. Laws 169 and therefore, did not conform to the requirements of R.I. Const. art. XXXI, &sect; 1. The court, however, found that the ordinary voter could have easily understood the nature of the matter being voted upon and the limit of the borrowing proposed. The owners also claimed that the authorization was invalid because the proposition did not disclose that the act provided for annual appropriations to pay the interest due on the bonds. They argued that such sum would exceed $ 50,000 and that the express consent of the people was required under the state's constitution. The court held that the word &quot;debts&quot; as used in R.I. Const. art. XXXI, &sect; 1 did not include unaccrued interest on bonds.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the taxpayer could not attack the tax administrator's compliance with R.I. Gen.

The court overruled the taxpayer's exceptions to the trial court's judgment, finding that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to pass upon the assessment's correctness because the taxpayer failed to avail itself of the statutory procedures established by the legislature as the only method by which the issue could be tested.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainant, an independent food retailer, brought six consolidated bills in equity to enjoin respondents, owners and operators of other retail markets, from advertising, offering, or selling food products below cost in violation of the Unfair Sales Practices Act (Act), R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 6-13-1 through 6-13-8. Finding important questions concerning the constitutionality of the Act affected the merits of the consolidated actions, the trial judge certified the questions to the state's highest court. The court found that, overall, the Act was a legitimate exercise of the state's police power, being referable to the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public. However, the provision requiring a retailer to recompute and exclude from replacement costs any sales not justified by existing market conditions, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 6-13-1(d), was defective for vagueness, uncertainty, and indefiniteness. That provision was therefore void but did not affect the Act's remaining provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A juvenile brought an action for false imprisonment against three municipal police officers. The action arose out of the warrantless arrest of the juvenile by the officers on information that was provided by his two juvenile accomplices that they had burglarized a local veterans' organization. The trial court denied the juvenile's motion for a directed verdict of guilty and submitted the case to the jury. A verdict of not guilty was returned in favor of the officers. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the juvenile's warrantless arrest was supported by probable cause that made his detention by the police lawful. The court determined that where an informer reasonably acquires knowledge concerning the criminal matters under investigation which relates to a particular suspect, an officer may act thereon to arrest the suspect without a warrant. The court concluded that public policy required that police officers, who have a citizen in their lawful custody, not be deterred from acting to protect the well-being of the person in custody, particularly in circumstances that arise out of an emergency situation.</SPAN></P>

The manufacturer, after learning that the seller sold its products at less than the stipulated minimum retail price, filed an action to enjoin such sale. The seller argued that the act was void on the grounds that it was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. The court, addressing the issue of the act's constitutionality, held that the act was within the legislature's police powers to protect the manufacturer's trademark. The court further held that a legislative authorization to restrict resale prices as against a seller under no compulsion to buy and acquiring with notice of the restriction was not an unlawful delegation of power to private persons to control the disposition of property of others. Thus, the court held, as applied to persons with actual notice of the stipulated minimum resale price, the act was not an unlawful delegation of legislative power. The court ruled, however, that it was an unlawful delegation of power as applied to a seller who purchased without actual notice of the stipulated minimum resale price.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a group of motor vehicle owners, sought review of a decision from the superior court (Rhode Island), which denied and dismissed their petitions against respondent motor vehicle registrar, alleging that they were improperly ordered by the registrar to pay double fees for the registration of the motor vehicles they operated for hire under the provisions of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 31-6-1(E) (1956).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motor vehicle owners challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 31-6-1(E) on the basis that it provided that the registration fees of motor vehicle for hire should be charged at double the rate of fees charged for such vehicles when not used for hire, but by way of an exception contained therein which relieved the citizens of their town from payment of double registration fees. The trial court dismissed the petitions on the ground that the statute provided for no exception to its requirement that vehicles for hire paid the double registration fee and that it made no classification that could by reason of discrimination be found to violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. On appeal, the court upheld the judgment and ruled that the statute discriminated only upon the basis of a reasonable distinction and related to the purposes for which the legislation was enacted. The legislation resulted in a closed class, so that the class created was not given any economic advantage over others who engaged in the operation of motor vehicles for hire. Therefore, the court held that the statute was not void by reason of repugnance to the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On certification of questions from a superior court (Rhode Island), the court considered claims for reimbursement of gross receipts taxes filed by petitioner taxpayer against respondent, State of Rhode Island. The taxpayer argued that R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 44, ch. 10 (1956) violated U.S. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 1, and R.I. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was an unincorporated business that was assessed a gross receipts tax under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-10-5 (1956). The taxpayer paid the assessment and filed a petition for a refund. The taxpayer argued that merchants were arbitrarily assessed different rates and that because gross receipts bore no relation to net profits or earnings, the tax was arbitrary. The superior court heard the matter, and it certified questions to the court. The court ordered the case sent back to the superior court, holding that the imposition of the tax under &sect; 44-10-5 was not so unfair as to be violative of R.I. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2. However, the exclusion in R. I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-10-5 (1956) of those businesses whose gross receipts were less than $ 30,000, while there was at the same time an exemption of only $ 5,000 provided for those businesses with total receipts whose gross was $ 30,000 or more, was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Therefore, the exclusion was void, except as to the first $ 5,000 in gross receipts. Under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-10-25, the invalid portion of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-10-5 (1956) was severable and the remainder was enforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified questions, construed part of the tax statute to be violative of the Equal Protection Clause, and returned the action to the superior court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that fellatio was not criminal, at least when performed in the circumstances revealed by the evidence, and could not be held to constitute an indecent act within the meaning of &sect; 11-34-5. The court disagreed with defendant and overruled his exceptions to the judgment of the superior court. The court found that under the provisions of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-10-1 (1956), fellatio was made criminal whatever the circumstances in which it was committed. The court determined that the legislature's intention in using the term &quot;crime against nature&quot; in &sect; 11-10-1 was to proscribe all unnatural copulation. The court noted that the provisions of related statutes revealed an intention to proscribe all copulation that took place outside of marriage. The court concluded that fellatio was criminal under the provisions of &sect; 11-10-1 and was therefore an indecent act within the purview of the pertinent provisions of &sect; 11-34-5. The court also determined that the language of &sect; 11-34-5 met the constitutional requirement of certainty in penal statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court was requested by the governor to give its opinion with respect to reapportionment of the state house of representatives in accordance with provisions of R.I. Const. art. XII, &sect; 2. The governor presented three questions regarding the validity of legislation enacted by the house in light of a recent judicial decision that the apportionment statute was unconstitutional and that the house was not properly apportioned under art. XIII.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor's first question asked whether the malapportioned house was competent to enact valid legislation. The court noted that R.I. Const. art. IV, &sect; 10, gave the legislature authority to exercise its power restricted only by prohibitory constitutional provisions. The court examined the apportionment requirements of art. XIII and held that they did not prohibit the house from exercising its legislative power for its failure to comply with the constitution in its method and basis of apportionment. The court therefore held that the house was competent to act and that its legislation was valid. On the same basis, the court also provided an affirmative response to the governor's question of whether the next house of representatives, elected under the same unconstitutional statute, would be able validly to exercise the legislative power. Finally, the court addressed the governor's question of whether the legislature's extension of time to a commission to propose reapportionment legislation was in confirmation with its constitutional duty. The court answered affirmatively and held that the legislature was entitled to a presumption that its action was taken in good faith.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the governor's three questions in the affirmative and held that the house was competent to enact valid legislation until such reasonable time that reapportionment could be provided for.</SPAN></P>
