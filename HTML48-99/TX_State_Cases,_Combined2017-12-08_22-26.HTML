Appellant sought judicial review and the trial court upheld appellee's action. Appellant sought further review and asserted that the trial court erred because it based its judicial review of appellee's decision by applying the substantial evidence rule to the record made in the agency hearing instead of to the evidence heard by the trial court. The court disagreed and held that under the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act, if the manner of review authorized by law for the decision complained of was other than by trial de novo, the review was to be conducted by the court sitting without a jury and was confined to the record with a few specific exceptions. The court therefore held that the trial court was correct in passing on the question of whether the suspension of appellant's license was supported by substantial evidence. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Nevertheless, plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the case. Plaintiff stated that the extensive legal time and expenses for the litigation, far exceeded any recovery.

Defendant contended that he did not want to be left with the stigma of a judgment for money damages. The court denied plaintiff's motion holding that the parties' action involved a question of public interest. An appellate court had discretion to hear a case involving a question of public interest, even if the case was moot.

The court held that future plans which might result in a future taking could not constitute a present taking. The court held that the remaining allegations were legal conclusions that were misleading because they failed to apprise appellees of the facts upon which appellant intended to rely to support any remaining cause of action for a present partial taking based solely on appellees' completed projects. The court held that the trial court could have reasonably concluded that appellant's petition only alleged facts supporting a cause of action for a present damaging and anticipated damage, and thus it was not error to conclude that the two-year statute of limitations under Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant university professor challenged an order from the District Court, Harris County (Texas), which either dismissed the case or rendered a take nothing judgment against him.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant university professor filed an action for the purpose of recovering salary and retirement benefits denied him when appellee university adopted a regulation requiring retirement at age 65, rather than 70, as were the terms of his previous employment contract. Appellant asserted causes of action for breach of contract, denial of due process, and equal protection. The court found that the words of his contract stated that his contractual rights were subordinate to the rules and regulations issued by the Board of Regents. The Board of Regents unanimously adopted the revised retirement policy. Therefore, the court held that this action did not violate either the state or the federal constitutional provision against the impairment of contractual rights. Also, there was no impairment of due process or equal protection because retirement at age 65 was rationally related to the objective, a younger, more vigorous faculty. The Supreme Court of Texas adhered to the rationality test. The court found the age classification to be reasonable, not arbitrary and, therefore, constitutionally permissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the United States government, challenged the decision of the District Court, El Paso County (Texas), which found that the military retirement pay of appellee's former husband was subject to garnishment in order to satisfy a child support arrearage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee former wife brought suit against appellant, the United States government, to have the military retirement pay of appellee's former husband turned over to satisfy a claim for unpaid child support. The trial court found in favor of appellee and appellant sought review. The court determined that military retirement pay was not current wages but was, instead, property. The court also determined that, as property, military retirement pay was not exempt from garnishment under Tex. Const. art. 16, &sect; 28 or Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4009. The court concluded, however, that the trial court had made findings that the former husband was in arrears and had ordered a third party, appellant, to turn over property of his to satisfy that finding without any notice to the former husband. Accordingly, the court concluded that the former husband was an indispensable party to the action. Because the procedure followed violated due process rights of the former husband and was carried out under an unconstitutional statute, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent employee died during the course of his employment. Appellant wife brought an action on behalf of her minor children to recover all the benefits for her children to the exclusion of appellees, decedent's minor children by a prior marriage, who had been adopted by their stepfather. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the appellees and order all children to share equally. Appellant sought review and contended that because the prior children were adopted, they were not &quot;minor children&quot; for the purposes of the workmen's compensation act. The court reversed and remanded. It found that adopted children were not entitled to workmen's compensation benefits, because upon legal adoption, the family relationship between the natural parent and the adopted children ended. They were no longer minor children of the natural father under the workmen's compensation statute and were the minor children of the adoptive father and their natural mother.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected appellant's contention that any conduct engaged in by appellant which endangered the child must have been directed toward the child. Rather, the court held that the statute which authorized termination only required that appellant's conduct endanger the physical or emotional well-being of the child and be committed in the child's presence. There was no requirement that the conduct be directed at the child. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's determination that appellant was guilty of committing acts of violence towards the mother while the child was present, that such acts endangered the physical well-being of the child, and that such acts were committed during the period of time up to and including immediately prior, and subsequent, to appellee's actually being given temporary custody of the child.</SPAN></P>

Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5096-6.01 et seq. (1971), against appellee builder. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee. The court reversed and rendered judgment for appellants. The court found that the contract to build a new house on appellant's property included a provision for a time-price differential that improperly gave appellee a first lien on appellants' property. The court held that a contract to provide both goods and services in the construction of a new home fit squarely within the statutory definition of &quot;retail installment transactions.&quot; The court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague under Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35 because the caption gave notice of its purpose of protecting consumers in retail credit transactions. The statute did not violate equal protection because its application was reasonably related to its purpose, and it did not provide excessive fines in violation of Tex. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff attorney challenged a judgment of the County Court of Law, Potter County, Texas, which entered a judgment in the amount of $ 3,074 for defendant, the owner of a lawn mower service, on a cross-claim for actual and exemplary damages for wrongful sequestration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff attorney contended that the jury findings on which the exemplary damages issue were conditioned, i. e., that he knew or should have known that he did not have a right to sequester the property, were insufficient to support a judgment for exemplary damages. He also argued that defendant, the owner of a lawn mower service, did not suffer damages because plaintiff posted a bond. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment against plaintiff, except the amount of damages awarded by the jury. The court held that the instructions given to the jury on certain special issues dealing with plaintiff's knowledge were defective, but plaintiff did not object to the jury instructions at trial as required by Tex. R. Civ. P. 272 and 274, so that issue was waived for purposes of the appeal. The court held that defendant suffered actual damages because he lost possession of the security for the repair bill, and the bond posted by plaintiff did not preclude recovery. However, the court found that the jury's award was excessive in the amount of $ 2,000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, holding that if defendant, owner of the lawn mower service, filed remittitur of $ 2,000 within 15 days, the judgment would be reformed and affirmed. Otherwise, the judgment would be reversed and the cause remanded to the trial court for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment that plaintiff take nothing. The court affirmed, holding that defendant's ordinances were constitutional. The court held that plaintiff suffered no denial of due process because he received notice and had opportunity to be heard. Plaintiff received written notice giving him 10 days to clean, and he received written notice giving him 60 days to pay the charges for defendant's clean-up before defendant's liens were perfected. After the liens were perfected, plaintiff sought judicial review. The court found that the ordinances provided for a reasonable and proper exercise of defendant's police power because if the vacant lot was allowed to accumulate weeds, brush, and rubbish, it could have constituted a health hazard nuisance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed finding that appellants violated Texas Securities Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 581-1, et seq. In affirming the lower court's decision, the appeals court rejected appellants' commerce and equal protection attack on the statutes. The appeals court held that a state statute affecting interstate commerce would be upheld where the statute regulated evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest and its effects on interstate commerce were incidental unless the burden imposed on such commerce was clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits. The appeals court found that Texas had a legitimate interest in taking precautions that oil and gas leases covering its lands were not the subject of fraudulent security practices. The appeals court held that any burden was incidental on interstate commerce and was insubstantial and not unreasonable. Next, the appeals court held that to successfully assert an equal protection claim, appellants were required to show more than unequal application. According to the appeals court, appellants were required to show that they fell within a protected class.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff father challenged the order of the Court of Domestic Relations in and for Dallas County, Texas, which held defendant mother was not subject to personal jurisdiction in Texas. Both parties agreed that the parent-child long-arm statute, Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 11.051 (1976), applied. Plaintiff argued &sect; 11.051 provided jurisdiction as the child was conceived in Texas and defendant lived in Texas with the child before both moved to Nebraska.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 11.051 provided jurisdiction, but that the facts, which established jurisdiction under &sect; 11.051, were constitutionally insufficient to satisfy traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. Plaintiff and the child had resided in Nebraska for a substantial period of time and necessarily the majority of witnesses who could testify to the best interests of the child, the determinative issue in the custody proceeding, were in Nebraska. The court interpreted &sect; 11.051 to include a presumption that the Texas courts were not convenient or competent forums to adjudicate claims affecting the child-parent relationship and unwarranted in asserting jurisdiction absent sufficient proof to overcome the presumption where the child and the managing conservator have resided in a foreign state for six months or more before the suit was filed. As plaintiff and the child had resided in Nebraska for more than six months before the suit was filed, the court affirmed the trial court's decision to refuse jurisdiction. The court also sustained the trial court's judgment as any judgment would not have been accorded full faith and credit under Nebraska law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court, which held defendant mother was not subject to personal jurisdiction in Texas under the parent-child long-arm statute. The court held the facts which established jurisdiction under the statute were constitutionally insufficient as the issue of the best interests of the child was better litigated in the foreign state because the child had resided there substantial time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant seller sought review of a judgment of a district court (Texas), in favor of plaintiff buyer in an action arising from the sale of a used boat, motor, and trailer. The trial court held that defendant made unknowingly false statements as to the condition of the boat, and held defendant liable to plaintiff under the Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Texas Business and Commerce Code &sect;&sect; 17.41 to 17.63 (1977).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff buyer filed suit against defendant seller alleging that he purchased a boat in reliance on a false representation that the boat was in good order. The trial court held that, although defendant was unaware that his statements were false, plaintiff was entitled to recover treble damages under the Deceptive Trade Practices Act (act), Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code &sect;&sect; 17.41 to 17.63 (1977). The court affirmed, holding that despite his innocent misrepresentation, defendant, a person selling second-hand goods previously purchased for his own use, was liable to plaintiff under the act. Defendant filed a motion for rehearing, arguing that the act could not be applied because it violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 13, 19. The court found that the act was neither unconstitutionally vague nor did it impose an excessive fine or punishment insofar as this case was concerned. The court held that because the trial court found that defendant did not know that his statements were false, the court erred in holding that the statements were in violation of the act. The court set aside its former judgment, reversed the trial court, and ordered that plaintiff take nothing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bondsman challenged the judgment of the District Court of Travis County, 201st Judicial District (Texas), which denied his application for a temporary injunction pending judicial review of the order of appellee county bail bond board, which denied appellant's application for a license to execute bail bonds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bondsman sought to review his license to issue bail bonds in the county. When appellee county bail bond board did not respond to appellant's request, appellant filed an application for a license. Appellee then denied appellant's application and appellant sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed and found that pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2372p-3, &sect; 11, a challenge of appellee's denial of appellant's application was by trial de novo and that the decision of appellee would have full force and effect pending the determination of the challenge. The court held that statutes which prohibit injunctions such as art. 2372p-3, &sect; 11 are constitutional unless appellant could show that he lost a protected property right. Here, appellant's license had expired pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2372p-3, &sect; 8(a). Therefore, the court found that appellant did not have a protected property right at the time his application was denied by appellee. The court further held that an injunction would have been improper due to the fact that injunction would have preserved the status quo, which was that appellant did not have a license.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court, which denied appellant bondsman's application for a temporary injunction because the decision of appellee county bail bond board was final pending an appeal unless appellant was deprived of a property right.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant illegal aliens challenged a summary judgment of the 126th Judicial District Court of Travis County (Texas), which decided that, by denying them tuition-free public education, appellees Houston Independent School District, the Texas Education Agency, and the State of Texas had not denied appellants their rights to equal protection under the law, due process, or other constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant illegal aliens disputed a summary judgment of a district court, which ruled that Tex. Educ. Code Ann. &sect; 21.031 (1975) did not violate their rights to equal protection or due process. The court assumed that the equal protection clause applied to appellants. Section 21.031, which provided tuition-free public education to legal aliens, did not deny equal protection of the law to appellants. Because a tuition-free education was not a fundamental right guaranteed by the United States Constitution, &sect; 21.031 was accorded a presumption of constitutionality. Classifications based upon alienage were suspect per se. However, the classification of &sect; 21.031 did not deal with alienage, but with a class based upon illegal residence in the United States. The status of an illegal alien was not an unchangeable one. Section 21.031 bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose. Public education was a social and economic function of the states. The due process clause applied to illegal aliens, but &sect; 21.031 did not deny appellants' due process by providing free education to others. Appellants' other constitutional grounds were not pleaded, so they were waived. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed. The statute that provided free public education to legal aliens did not deny appellant illegal aliens equal protection of the law. A free education was not a fundamental right, nor was classification based on alienage a suspect class. The statute bore a rational relation to a legitimate state purpose and did not abridge appellants' right to due process. Other constitutional grounds were not pleaded, so they were waived.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city filed a lawsuit against appellants, property owners, seeking recovery of paving costs and foreclosure of a paving lien upon appellants' property. Appellants filed a motion seeking a declaration that the paving assessments against their property were null and void. The trial court entered judgment for appellee. On review, appellant argued that the statute by which their property was assessed violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV. However, the court found that appellee had legislative authority to determine the propriety and advisability of undertaking street improvement projects. Furthermore, appellants did not show any abuse of power, and did not show that appellee's action was arbitrary in any particular way. Therefore, the court held that the statutory method of assessment was not invalid. Appellants also argued that pursuant to U.S. Const. amend XIV, they were entitled to a hearing prior to appellee's decision to pay for the street improvements by private assessment. However, the court found that appellants were afforded a proper and adequate hearing prior to the time the assessment actually became irrevocably fixed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant water well users sought review of a judgment of the 157th District Court of Harris County (Texas), upholding the constitutionality of the Harris-Galveston Coastal Subsidence District Act, 1975 Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant water well users filed an action seeking a determination that 1975 Tex. Gen. Laws 284, the act that created the Harris-Galveston Coastal Subsidence District with the purpose of regulating groundwater withdrawal, was unconstitutional. The district court upheld the act's constitutionality. On appeal, the court held that Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 59 set out flood control as an approved form of conservation of the state's natural resources. Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 59(c) did not prohibit permit fee financing. The purpose of the statutorily created charge was to regulate, not to raise revenues, and, therefore, it was not a tax. The legislature could have properly concluded that appellants' wells contributed to the subsidence which causes flooding and, therefore, the act did not violate Equal Protection or Due Process principles. Constitutional equal protection related to persons as such, and not to areas. Therefore, there was no constitutional requirement that the subsidence district extend into other counties, even though legitimate objects of regulation existed in those counties. Finally, there was no statutory impediment to the issuance of one-year temporary permits.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, as modified, the trial court's decision. The order was reformed to disallow collection of taxes delinquent before December 31, 1939, because such modification fulfilled the will of the legislature and provided an adequate remedy without impairing any contractual obligation owed or owned by appellee judgment creditors.

A trial court granted appellee state's summary judgment motion ordering appellants to secure licenses to the child care homes and to admit the agents of the state department of public welfare for inspection purposes. Appellants sought review. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court determined that the trial court correctly found that jury questions five and six were questions of law and that the remainder of the alleged questions were questions of fact, which were agreed to by appellee. Consequently, there was nothing left for the trial court but to apply the applicable law to the undisputed facts. The facts of the case disclosed that there was no question as to the sincerity of appellants' religious beliefs. The court did not agree with appellants' argument, that even though appellee was not served with a copy of the plea, the trial court still erred in failing to grant appellants' plea of privilege. The court held that Tex. R. Civ. P. 86 required the moving party to serve the adverse party with a copy of the plea. The plea had to be controverted only if the adverse party was served with a copy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's award to appellee theaters' recovery of taxes based on the grounds that the tax was unconstitutional and held that the tax as applied to the licensing of motion picture films was valid and constitutional. The court determined the classification was constitutional because it was not arbitrary or unreasonable, and it was based upon reality. The court rejected appellant's arguments that it is not unconstitutional for the exhibitor to be liable for payment of the tax and the distributor to be liable for collection of the tax; that the sales tax is applicable to film rentals as a tax on rental of tangible personal property; that the correct tax base is cost of rental to the lessee; and that receipts from rental of motion picture films to theaters have not been totally exempted from sales tax. The court found that the Texas Limited Sales, Excise and Use Tax, placed the incidence of the tax on the distributor as lessor instead of the exhibitor as lessee, was deleted from the tax act. The court found that this change imposed tax on the lessee who occupied the place of the purchaser.</SPAN></P>

Educ. Code Ann. &sect; 13.903 (1969), was contrary to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6252-14 and the Texas Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant school district did not renew plaintiff teachers' annual employment contracts on the basis of their age, plaintiffs sought damages and a declaratory judgment, alleging that defendant's compulsory retirement policy, pursuant to Tex. Educ. Code Ann. &sect; 13.903 (1969), was contrary to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6252-14 and the equal protection clauses of the Texas Constitution, which was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the plain meaning of &sect; 13.903 gave defendant full authority to establish a uniform retirement age. The court also found that, because &sect; 13.903 was a specific statute applicable only to retirement in school districts, while art. 6252-14 was a general statute applicable to many state agencies, &sect; 13.903, as the specific statute, prevailed, pursuant to Code of Construction Act &sect; 3.06.

The suit arose from a purchase of a mobile home from appellant mobile home corporation, which was evidenced by an order form and an installment contract. The contract was assigned to appellant credit company. Appellee alleged that appellants sold appellee property insurance at a premium that was not approved by the state board of insurance and that this was not disclosed to appellee. The court affirmed and held that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5069-7.06(3) (1971) demonstrated an intent for the disclosure be in the contract. Appellee's pleadings and amended pleadings were sufficient to show that the rate charged by appellants was not approved by the state board of insurance.

The district court set aside the commission's order, and appellant city sought review. The court reversed the district court and sustained the order of the commission suspending appellee. The court held that the evidence did not show that reasonable minds could not have reached the conclusion that the commission reached. Accordingly, the trial court erred in failing to find that substantial evidence supported the order of the commission. The court also held that the trial court erred in finding that appellee did not say the words or engage in the conduct stated, because the trial judge was not to act as factfinder.

On review, the court affirmed and found the pre-marital agreement was not in violation of Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 15. The court held the contract was sanctioned by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee individual recovered a judgment in a Louisiana trial court against appellant individual in a suit for damages resulting from an automobile collision. Appellee then sought enforcement of the award in Texas. However, appellant argued that the judgment was not entitled to enforcement, as the question of jurisdiction had not been fully and finally litigated in the Louisiana trial court. The court noted that appellant appeared before the Louisiana trial court to contest jurisdiction and that the Louisiana trial court found that it had jurisdiction over the case. Thus, the court concluded that the Louisiana trial court's subsequent judgment was entitled to enforcement in Texas. In reaching its conclusion, the court held that the Louisiana trial court's certified opinion was sufficient to establish that a final determination on the issue of jurisdiction had been reached. Additionally, the court reasoned that, even if the jurisdictional determination was a non-appealable interlocutory order, appellant's failure either to litigate on the merits of the claim in Louisiana, or to challenge the default judgment in Louisiana, rendered the Louisiana judgment binding in Texas.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff challenged the order of the Bexar County Court (Texas) that denied his petition for an injunction to restrain defendant city from enforcing its &quot;wrecker&quot; ordinance, which vested the exclusive right to remove abandoned or disabled vehicles from city streets in one wrecking service, arguing that the ordinance improperly interfered with the constitutional rights of citizens to enter contracts with a party of their own choosing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed suit seeking to restrain defendant city from enforcing its &quot;wrecker&quot; ordinance, which gave a certain wrecking service exclusive right to tow away a vehicle abandoned on a city street or that had been involved in a collision and precluded all other wrecker operators from handling such vehicles unless directed by the police. The trial court denied plaintiff's request for an injunction, and plaintiff appealed, arguing that the ordinance prohibited individuals from contracting with the wrecker of their choice in removing a disabled vehicle. In affirming, the appellate court concluded that nothing in the record compelled a conclusion that the regulation was not reasonable, for a reasonable relationship existed between the regulation and the legitimate police power objective that defendant was attempting to accomplish. Where wreckers engaged in fiercely competitive efforts to induce car owners to engage the services and where such conduct resulted in disorder and confusion at accident scenes, the adoption of the ordinance was proper in an effort to maintain order and did not unconstitutionally interfere with the contractual rights of citizens.</SPAN></P>

Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 18.18(a). Police and Public Safety officers search a building with a warrant, found claimant's numbers operation, and seized $ 711. Claimant's house was also searched and the officers confiscated a large sum of money at this address. Claimant testified that he kept the money in his clothes at his house, because the internal revenue service had a lien on his assets and had seized two bank accounts. Claimant testified that some of the money came from his paint and body shop or from his demolition business, but admitted that some might have come from his gambling operations. On appeal, the court held that the forfeiture statute was constitutional pursuant to recent precedent and that the trial court had jurisdiction to forfeit claimant's property. The court held that the state did not have to show that the money seized was from a gambling house or used for gambling purposes. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs and cross-claiming defendants appealed and argued that the ten-year limitation of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city challenged the trial court's approval, pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2324 (1976), of petitioner court reporter's fee for professional services rendered in a non-jury trial. Respondent refused to pay petitioner's fee, arguing it was unreasonably high and that that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2324 (1976) unconstitutionally delegated from the legislative branch to the judicial branch the power to set the amount of court reporter fees. On appeal, the court held that Tex. Rev. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner brought suit for declaratory and injunctive relief requesting that appellee city be prohibited from enforcing an ordinance concerning storage of vehicles on residential property. The trial court granted judgment in favor of appellee. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the ordinance was sufficient to advise anyone of ordinary intelligence that a person who engaged in certain conduct described in the ordinance was guilty of an offense. The ordinance was not impermissibly vague because the phrase &quot;incidental to the use&quot; in the ordinance fell well within the bounds of reasonable certainty. The evidence justified the trial court's finding that vehicles were stored on appellant's premises and that such storage was not incidental to the permitted residential use. The ordinance was constitutional in its application to the facts of appellant's case. The court noted that the filing of a criminal complaint against appellant did not prevent him from obtaining administrative relief, by way of a variance, from the requirements of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2372q-1 (1975) provided that the commissioners court of any county with a population of more than 1.5 million should regulate private water company rates if the company had charged residential rates exceeding 30 percent or more the highest rate charged by the water department of the largest city in the county. Appellee State of Texas filed an action against appellant private water company, seeking to enjoin appellant from charging rates in excess of those authorized by the Harris County Commissioners Court. The trial court granted the injunction, but, on appeal, the court reversed. The court found that art. 2372q-1 violated Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 56 because it was a special or local law. The court found that because Harris County was the only county in the state with the designated population and because the legislature intended to limit the life of the law to one year, art. 2372q-1 was based entirely upon existing circumstances and application of the statute was &quot;closed&quot; to other local units. Thus, the court found that the law was unconstitutional and did not vest power in the commissioner's court to regulate appellant's rates.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed, finding that there was substantial evidence to support appellant's findings and that there was no evidence that appellant acted arbitrarily or capriciously or discriminated against appellee in any way.

The court held that repeal by implication was not favored and was not proper in this case. The court held that the legislature made venue in Tex. Educ.

Appellant father made a motion to dismiss on the grounds that appellees stated no cause of action in that they did not allege him to be an unfit parent. The trial court overruled appellant's motion. Then following a hearing on the merits, the trial court granted the grandparents temporary possession rights. Appellant complained absent pleading and proof of unfitness, he had the absolute right of custody and control over the child, and that a court could not award a grandparent visitation rights over the objection of the parents. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment because Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 14.03(d) clearly gave appellees the right to judicially seek visitation rights to the child, and the court had the authority to order such visitation rights in favor of the grandparents.

The trial court declared that appellant was a delinquent child and committed him to the custody of the Texas Youth Council.

The total absence of corroborative evidence merely meant that the evidence, due to the absence of the required independent evidence, was insufficient to establish the corpus delicti. In addition, the fact that a police officer, while escorting appellant across the street from the detention center to the court room, informed him that his first statement could not be used and that he had a right to remain silent, fell far short of satisfying the requirements of the statutory scheme.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, holding that the English rule of absolute ownership provided that the person who owned the surface could dig therein at his free will and pleasure. The trial court found that plaintiffs' inconvenience fell within the description of damna absque injuria. Plaintiffs appealed, contending that this was not a water rights case and that the trial court should have considered the damage to their land. The appellate court agreed and reversed the trial court's order. The court held that if defendants were negligent in any manner, and the negligence was the proximate cause of the subsidence, the fact that they owned the water produced did not insulate defendants from liability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile was charged with a felony. The juvenile court waived jurisdiction over defendant and jurisdiction was transferred to the trial court. On appeal, defendant asserted that Tex. Fam.

III, &sect; 35, which stated that a bill could not contain a subject not expressed in its title. The court held that in deciding the constitutionality of a statute, it presumed that the statute was valid and that the legislature did not act unreasonably or arbitrarily. Further, the burden was on the one who challenged an act to establish its unconstitutionality, and both Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35, and Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 54.02, were to be liberally construed in favor of constitutionality. Finally, art. III, &sect;35 required only that the title of a statute state the general subject; it did not have to explain the details. Here, the caption to &sect; 54.02 adequately stated that the statute contained court procedures relative to delinquent children. The court affirmed, holding that defendant failed to show a violation of art. III, &sect; 35.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed, finding that under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

On appeal, the court determined that the state was required to prove not only that termination of parental rights was in the best interest of the child but that appellant had committed some act under &sect;&sect; 15.02(1) that endangered the child's physical or emotional well-being. The court found that the evidence was uncontroverted that appellant and her daughter expressed mutual love and affection.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant tax collector sought review of a judgment from the 190th District Court, Harris County (Texas), which declared that City of Houston, Tex., Code of Ordinances &sect; 44-9 was unconstitutional and void to the extent it prohibited appellee property owners from authorizing appellee tax consultants to file renditions on their behalf.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, property owners and tax consultants, filed suit against appellant tax collector, claiming that he was enforcing an ordinance so as to prohibit persons such as appellee owners from retaining appellee tax consultants to render property for tax purposes. A verdict was directed for appellees, based in part on a finding that the ordinance was unconstitutional. Appellant sought review, and the court affirmed in part, and reversed in part. It found ample evidence that appellee consultants were agents of appellee property owners for the purpose of rendering the property, and that appellee owners remained liable for their agents' actions in the rendition process. The court rejected appellant's claim that the duty to render was nondelegable, and resolved the claimed ambiguity in the ordinance by holding that an owner, or an agent in possession, whose duty it was to render the property, was permitted to delegate that duty to other agents, such as appellee consultants. Any other holding resulted in a fatal discrepancy between the ordinance's title and its text. The court also vacated the lower court's finding of unconstitutionality, as no party had pleaded that issue.</SPAN></P>

Appellee received an administrative hearing and was discharged. The jury found in favor of appellee and awarded compensatory and exemplary damages, and appellants sought review. The court reformed the judgment to delete recovery against appellant agents individually and otherwise affirmed. Given appellant agent's letter indicating that the presence of methadone in appellee constituted grounds for termination under Rule G, which prohibited narcotic use, the jury was entitled to conclude that appellant's agent was stating that appellee had used narcotics in violation of the rule. Submission of a special issue to the jury that combined elements of proof was not an abuse of discretion. A finding of knowing falsity or reckless disregard was not constitutionally required because the applicable standard of liability was negligence and actual injury.

Appellant contended that he was denied due process under U.S. Const. amend.

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that in the absence of any state case law on point and in recognition of federal authorities under which similar statutes had been upheld, the standard of commitment under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5547-51 was constitutional and not vague. The court held that the preponderance of the evidence burden used by the trial court did not violate due process and was constitutional. The court found no legal basis for appellant's contention that Tex. Rev, Civ. Stat.

Defendants, relying on Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1995, &sect; 19, filed pleas of privilege to be sued in Randall County. The trial court overruled defendants' pleas on the grounds that venue was sustainable in Potter County under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1995, &sect;&sect; 4 and 29a. On review, the court found that subdivision 29a could not, within its own terms, sustain venue. Rather, it could only be considered in conjunction with some other exception to the venue rules. Further, subdivision 29a could not, in this instance, operate in conjunction with subdivision 4 because none of the defendants were residents of Potter County. Therefore, the court held that subdivision 19 prevailed over subdivisions 4 and 29a, and the plea of privilege should have been sustained.

The trial court enjoined appellants state pharmacy board from enforcing the statute, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

On appeal, the court affirmed because the statute was not a valid exercise of police power, as it bore no relation to the safety, health, security, and protection of the general welfare of the state's citizens. The Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act more effectively controlled deceptive trade practices than a blanket prohibition on drug advertisement, and the state's interest in pharmacists' professionalism was not greatly served by legislation that kept the public ignorant of prescription drug prices.</SPAN></P>

Appellee had challenged the manner by which the electors in question, persons under the age of 65 and living in nursing homes operated by appellant, obtained their absentee ballots. The court found that there had been a failure to comply with the provisions of Tex. Elec.

Accordingly, the absentee votes were rendered void. Appellant's equal protection argument was without merit. The electors in question could have appeared and voted at the appropriate voting polls.

The trial court had decreed that appellant issue appellee a license to operate billiard tables in his business establishments. The court held that its was the trial court's duty to ascertain whether or not there was substantial evidence reasonably sufficient to support appellee's negative action. From the record, the claimed denial of cross-examination of witnesses against appellee was the only deprivation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV rights that had a semblance of proof to support it. Nevertheless, appellee's bare conclusion that cross-examination was denied did not raise an issue. A witness's opinion on an ultimate legal question was of no probative value.

The trial court denied appellant's pleas of privilege under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art.1995 &sect; 27 (1964).

On review, the court found that the Supreme Court had decided the issue and held that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

The trial court submitted special issues to a jury and granted the divorce on the grounds that the marriage had become insupportable because of discord or conflict of personalities that destroyed the legitimate ends of the marriage relationship and prevented any reasonable expectation of reconciliation. Appellant wife challenged the unequal division of the estate. Texas law provided that upon granting a decree of divorce, the court should divide the marital estate having due regard to the rights of each party. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect;3.63 (1975). There was sufficient evidence in the record, if believed, to sustain a value slightly greater for the property awarded to appellant wife than for that property awarded to appellee husband. The judgment was affirmed because the division was not unfair or unjust and there was no indication that the court failed to consider all of the evidence that was before it.</SPAN></P>

Further, the court held that the regulation was not too vague to give notice of the conduct which may be in violation and that the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's finding of a violation. The court concluded that appellant did not discharge its burden to establish the invalidity of the regulation, holding that mere absence of a definition of &quot;uncombined water&quot; in the regulation did not establish that the term was impermissibly vague. The court also concluded that appellant did not show that the board's method of determining opacity was so subjective and arbitrary as to establish that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the temporary injunction.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the injunction and ordered the garnishment. The trial court ultimately entered summary judgment in favor of appellees. On appeal, the court affirmed the summary judgment in favor of appellees and ruled that appellant failed to establish his affirmative defenses by proper summary-judgment evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient challenged the order of the lower court requiring her temporary involuntary commitment. Appellant contended that the lower court's order violated her constitutional rights to due process and that there was insufficient evidence to support the lower court's order. The court held that it had appropriate jurisdiction to review the matter and that there was no abuse of appellant's due process rights. The court found that appellant was given appropriate notice of the temporary hospitalization proceedings and an analysis of the Texas civil commitment procedure showed that there were adequate safeguards in place to protect appellant's interests against any abuses in temporary hospitalization proceedings. The court also determined that an order for temporary hospitalization under Tex. Mental Health Code Ann. &sect;38 required clear, unequivocal, and convincing proof. Despite finding that appellant's due process rights were not violated, however, the court found that there was insufficient factual evidence to support the temporary civil commitment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued defendants under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act (Act) for fraudulent misrepresentation. Plaintiff alleged that defendants' agent informed him that a car he was going to purchase would average a particular mileage per gallon and that this induced him to purchase the car. After purchasing the car, plaintiff learned that the car got much worse fuel economy. Defendants counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment finding the Act unconstitutional. The trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's claim but denied relief on the counterclaim. Defendants appealed, and the court affirmed. A prerequisite for a declaratory judgment action was the existence of a justiciable controversy. A justiciable controversy only existed between parties asserting protectable, present rights; not where the movant's interest was contingent upon the occurrence of numerous future events. Here, the only real controversy was determined by the summary judgment in favor of defendants on plaintiff's claim. Once plaintiff's claim was determined, there were no more adverse claims, and thus, no justiciable controversy between the parties.</SPAN></P>

Defendants requested that the trial court take judicial notice of the pleadings and depositions contained in the earlier cases' record, which had been litigated in the trial court. The trial court granted the motion. On appeal from that decision, the court held that Tex. R. Civ. P. 166A(e) required defendants to attached a certified copy of the records and proceedings in the earlier case to the motion for summary judgment. Because certified copies of the papers, records, and other documents from the prior case were not attached to the motion, defendants did not comply with Rule 166A(e) and were not entitled to summary judgment.

The trial court granted a temporary injunction prohibiting appellant from acting under the statute pending trial on the merits.

That this proceeding involved a temporary injunction or that appellee request injunctive as well as declaratory relief did not alter the jurisdictional nature of the &sect; 11 requirement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant &quot;mixed beverage&quot; bars challenged a judgment from the 126th Judicial District Court of Travis County (Texas), which held that appellants take nothing in an action appellants brought to recover taxes paid under protest and as a class action attacking validity of the Texas Liquor Control Act, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;666-20d, which levied a tax on gross receipts of certain permittees from sale of mixed alcoholic beverages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant &quot;mixed beverage&quot; bars, which were engaged in the business of selling &quot;mixed drinks&quot; containing alcohol, challenged a judgment from a trial court in an action to recover taxes paid under protest. Appellants also sought to file a class action attacking the validity of the Texas Liquor Control Act, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;666-20d, which levied a tax on gross receipts from sale of mixed alcoholic beverages. However, wine and beer retailers who also sold alcoholic drinks were not required to pay the tax. Appellants contended that the statute was discriminatory and unconstitutional, and that the classification for purposes of taxation had no reasonable basis. Although reference was not made to provisions of the state constitution relied upon, the appellate court inferred from argument that appellants were attacking the validity of the statute for its claimed failure to meet the requirements of equality and uniformity. The appellate court affirmed the judgment that the challenged statute was constitutional, holding that the fact that &quot;mixed beverage&quot; bars were also allowed to sell beer and wine containing less than 14 percent alcohol was not fatal to validity of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the lower court was affirmed that held appellant &quot;mixed beverage&quot; bars take nothing because appellants failed to satisfy their burden of demonstrating that the classifications resulting from the statute resulted in such discriminations and unequal treatment as was sufficient to invalidate the statute.</SPAN></P>

Relator filed a petition for mandamus to compel respondent to deliver the statement to it without advance payment and for declaratory relief on the constitutionality of art. 2324. The court held that it had no jurisdiction under Tex. Rev. Stat. Ann. arts. 1822 and 1823 to grant declaratory relief. However, because relator was a public official and interfered with the court by withholding a vital part of the record, the court had jurisdiction to issue mandamus against relator.

Prior to the hearing, appellant signed a waiver, witnessed by her attorney, stating that she did not desire to be present at the hearing. Appellant claimed that error occurred, arguing that the right to be present at commitment hearing could not be waived, the Texas Mental Health Code was unconstitutional because it did not require the state to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, that it was error not to give notice to appellant of her U.S.Const. amend.

The court affirmed the judgment and noted that appellant could waive her right to be present at a hearing and that the statute was constitutional. The court also noted that, without a statement of facts, it was unable to determine what alternatives were or were not considered by the trial court, and nothing in the record before it to indicated that the judgment was based solely on hearsay evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county committee circulated a petition to call a local option election for the sale of alcoholic beverages in within the incorporated limits of a city that sat on the border of appellant's county and an adjacent county. When appellee county clerk refused to certify that the required number of qualified voters had signed the petition, appellant sought a writ of mandamus to compel appellee to certify the results of a count of the signatures on the petition. The request for the writ was denied, and the court affirmed. Appellant failed to demonstrate clearly and unequivocally that it had a right to compel appellee to perform the ministerial act; therefore, appellant was not entitled to the issuance of a writ of mandamus. The court observed that Tex. Penal Code Aux. Laws art. 666, &sect; 32 (1975) authorized appellant to call an election but only within its county limits, and that appellant had no power beyond the county itself under Tex. Const. art. 5, &sect; 18. Therefore, appellant had no clear statutory authority to order a local option election for a city which was partially within appellant's county and an adjacent county. Thus, denial of the writ of mandamus was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school district filed suit against appellee property owner to recover delinquent personal property ad valorem taxes. The trial court, sitting without a jury, found that the taxes had not been levied as required by law and entered a take nothing judgment against appellant. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision in part and affirmed it in part. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment as to the 1971 and 1972 taxes. However, it reversed and rendered the trial court's decision that appellant could not recover from appellee taxes for 1969, 1970, 1973 and 1974. The court held that there was no evidence upon which the trial court could have properly based a finding that, as to the taxable years 1973-74, appellee's levy had not been accomplished as required by law. As to the 1969-70 taxes, the court held appellant's ad valorem taxes were properly levied by verbal motion and validated under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. 2815g-61. However, the court held that the taxes for the years 1971 and 1972 were not properly levied.

The trial court denied injunctive relief; appellants challenged the judgment, and the court affirmed. After affirming that jurisdiction was proper, the court held that the caption of the Act satisfied Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35 because the Act was amendatory and the constitution did not require such captions to specify changes made so long as the general subject was disclosed. Sections 13 and 14 of the Act aimed to prevent consumer deception and protect the public's financial safety and thus were justifiable exercises of state police power. The Act did not violate equal protection because its regulation of those engaged in mobile home sale or manufacture was reasonable, and it did not violate the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution because it complied with federal law and was not an obstacle to Congress's objectives in related laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an oil company, challenged penal ordinances enacted by appellee city that limited the size of gasoline tanker trucks that could deviate from designated delivery routes on city streets. Appellant wanted to use a 9,000 gallon tanker for deliveries to its retail stations, an act prohibited by the ordinances, and sought injunctive and declaratory relief in district court, which held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the merits but also filed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court described a two-part test for determining when an equitable court had the power to decide whether a penal ordinance was valid: when irreparable harm would result to vested property rights and when the ordinance was void. The court held that appellant had no vested property right in the public streets, which were incidental to its business. Further, the court found that the penal ordinances were well within the police power of the city and not unreasonable or void. Hence, the district court's decision that it had no jurisdiction to determine the validity of the ordinances was affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff bank brought an action against defendant car dealer to collect a sum allegedly due on certain automobile lease contracts. Plaintiff brought a motion for temporary injunction asking for delivery of the leased automobiles to plaintiff pending trial on the merits. The trial court rendered an order directing defendant to deliver the leased automobiles or to post a bond in the approximate value of the cars. Defendant challenged the trial court's order, and plaintiff moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The court overruled the motion to dismiss the appeal and held that the trial court's order was a temporary mandatory injunction. The court reversed the order and dissolved the injunction. The court held that the injunction order was invalid because it did not state the reasons an injunction was granted, and because plaintiff did not post a bond.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant engineering firm brought an action to recover sums alleged to be due it under the terms of a written contract entered into between appellant and appellee city.

The trial court granted summary judgment to appellee, holding that appellant's action was barred by the statute of limitations, and the contract was void pursuant to Tex.

The court affirmed, because the executory express contract for permanent improvements created debt with no payment provision, in violation of Tex. Const. art. 11, &sect;&sect; 5,7.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged the decision of the 3rd Judicial District Court, Henderson County, Texas, which held that the zoning ordinance was invalid and null and void, and ordered appellant, its secretary, and all other officials to grant appellee applicant's building permit to construct a building for the operation of a package liquor store.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment declaring the zoning ordinance invalid, null, and void. The property of appellee applicant was zoned &quot;residential&quot; by the zoning ordinance. The court held that the zoning ordinance did not prohibit the building of a residence upon a commercially zoned area, nor did it prohibit the erection of a commercial building upon an area zoned residential. The court found that it described a certain area as commercial, and then it declared all other property residential. The court found that the ordinance did not describe what type or kind of residential structures could be built. The court found that the ordinance did not provide any criteria or guidelines for appellee's secretary to follow in granting or refusing building permits; therefore, it was implied that the secretary had discretionary authority without restriction in issuing or denying permits. The court concluded that it was not the legislature's intent to validate the ordinance when appellee had not availed itself of the power to enact a zoning ordinance and that such failure was a substantive defect. The court found that it had not appointed a zoning commission nor had it attempted to do so.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review and the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that appellant was the sole minor child of deceased workman who was killed in an industrial accident for which death benefits were payable. Appellant's mother had remarried and her new husband adopted appellant. The adoption statute&nbsp;Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 46a, prevented the recovery of death benefits by appellant because she was no longer the workman's minor child under the workmen's compensation statute&nbsp;Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 8306, &sect; 8a. The court determined that appellant lost the right to recover from her natural father, but she was given the right to recover from the adoptive father. The court held there was no violation of the equal protection clause of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because appellant was not deprived of a right but simply had that right transferred from one parent to another.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of appellee insurer in appellant workmen's compensation claimant's action for total disability benefits. The court found that appellant's last injurious exposure to asbestos occurred before the repeal of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 8306, &sect; 25 (repealed 1971), and held the limitation period in &sect; 25 controlled appellant's action and time barred his claim. The court found that, under &sect; 25, appellee was relieved of liability upon the expiration of three years following appellant's last injurious exposure to asbestos and the court read the provisions of &sect; 25 into the parties' contractual arrangement. The court held that retroactive application of amendments to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 8306, &sect; 20 (amended 1971), which would have used the date of appellant's cumulative injury to establish the date his disability was caused and thereby would have moved forward the beginning of the limitation period, would have unconstitutionally impaired appellee's substantive right to rely upon the statutory scheme as a defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a raid on a dice game, the police seized appellant gamblers' cash, which was forfeited to appellee state as gambling proceeds. The police had a search warrant for one house but entered another, searched appellants, and seized the cash. The search warrant was invalid as to appellants' house, and there was no other valid ground to sustain it. An undercover police officer, who was present at the dice game, could have arrested appellants because they were gambling in his presence and could have conducted searches incident to the arrests, but he remained in the background and did not make any arrests, searches, or seizures. The other officers could not have conducted any searches or made any arrests because no offenses were committed in their presence. The undercover officer, possessing sufficient probable cause to make an arrest, did not communicate any information to the arresting officers. Thus, any searches made incident to appellants' arrests were invalid. Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged the judgment of the District Court, Bexar County (Texas), which found that an ordinance which contained a fuel and gas adjustment charge was an invalid delegation of legislative authority and that those monies collected from appellee independent school districts under this ordinance and deposited in appellant's general fund constituted a tax on public property in violation of Tex. Const. art. 8, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to the increased cost of fuel and gas, appellant city passed an ordinance with a rate adjustment clause which adjusted the charge to customers based on the cost of fuel and gas. Management of the utility systems was in a local agency, the City Public Service Board of San Antonio, which billed customers and dispersed payments according to legislative mandate. Some of the revenue was directed to appellant's general fund. Appellee independent school districts claimed that the ordinance improperly delegated legislative authority and that any of the charges against them which resulted in revenue deposited into the general fund were an illegal tax prohibited by Tex. Const. art. 8, &sect; 2. In reversing the decision of the lower court, the court found that the rate adjustment clause was tantamount to a mathematical formula which the board applied to the cost of fuel and gas. Because the board had no discretion in adjusting the formula, the ordinance did not improperly delegate legislative power. The court found that the portion of the monies that appellees paid which ultimately went into the general fund was at best a use tax and therefore not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment because the ordinance of appellant city that contained the rate adjustment charges gave the City Public Service Board nothing more than a mathematical formula by which to set rates and was therefore not an invalid delegation of legislative power. The charge paid by appellee independent school districts was a use tax which was not prohibited by the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, school district, tax assessor collector, and boards of equalization and trustee, sought review of the order of the 14th District Court of Dallas County, Texas, which granted appellee airlines' petition for declaratory judgment and permanent injunction, exempting appellee's leasehold interest from taxation, tax liability, as well as from liens or threats of actions to enforce tax collection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee airlines obtained a declaratory judgment and permanent injunction against appellants, school district, tax assessor collector, and boards of equalization and trustee, which exempted appellee's leasehold in a 15.49 acre tract and improvements at the airport from taxation, tax liability, and threats of actions to enforce tax collection. On appeal, the court found that the tract and improvements were a public transportation facility within the meaning of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7173 (1971), as the tract and improvements were used in safe and efficient operation of the airport. The court also held that art. 7173 was not unconstitutional because it was a valid legislative act, and such acts were presumed to be constitutional unless the infirmity was clearly manifest. However, the court held that the relief granted by the trial court was too broad and extensive, and that there was no support in the record for injunctive relief, as there was no showing of irreparable injury or the absence of an adequate remedy at law. Therefore, the court modified the trial court's judgment to limit appellee's tax exempt status to a one year period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment of the trial court to declare that appellee airlines' 15.49 acre tract and its improvements were exempted from taxation for only a definite period of time. However, the court held that the injunctive relief could not be sustained. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court as modified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother sought review of the judgment of Juvenile Court No. 3, Harris County, Texas, which issued a directed verdict to appellees, the father and his wife, on appellant's petition for a bill of review to set aside a judgment that terminated her parental rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother signed a statement given to her by appellees, the father and his wife, that she relinquished her rights to her son. Shortly thereafter, appellees obtained a decree of termination. Appellant petitioned for a bill of review to set aside the judgment of termination, which was denied. In affirming the judgment, the court found that appellant had not shown any fraud on the part of appellees with respect to her relinquishment of rights. The statement that she signed clearly set out that she was giving up these rights, and it contained a statement of a notary that appellant had verified that she read and understood the statement. There was also no fraud shown in the later termination proceeding. Appellees had no obligation to notify appellant of court dates, and appellant made no showing that the judgment of termination occurred by accident or mistake. The court also found that appellees had not violated any notice provision of the statute dealing with relinquishment of these rights. Rather, under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 15.03(d) (1975), appellant had the right to revoke the relinquishment up to the time the judgment of termination was entered against her.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment because there was no showing that appellees, father and his wife, had perpetrated a fraud on appellant mother regarding the termination of her parental rights. Appellant signed a document which clearly stated that she freely relinquished her rights to her son, appellees had no obligation to inform appellant of court hearings in the termination action, and no right to notice was violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a corporation and a guarantor, filed an action to enjoin the sale of property pursuant to the terms of a note and deed of trust in favor of appellee lienholder. A temporary restraining order was issued, and the trial court appointed a receiver for the property. A trustee subsequently sold the property at public auction, and in response, appellants filed a trespass to try title suit. The two actions were consolidated, and appellee counterclaimed for a deficiency judgment. The trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment, and appellants sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed. Appellants were precluded from challenging the order that appointed a receiver because they failed to file an appeal within the 20-day period required by Tex. R. Civ. P. 385. Summary judgment on appellants' trespass to try title claim was proper, because appellants' failed to pay or tender the amount of indebtedness due, and there was no evidence that trustee was forced to resign. Sale by substitute trustee was proper because he was not required to repost notices of sale. Further, interest rate of loan was not usurious, and appellee properly established amount of deficiency.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee corporation filed suit to recover franchise taxes paid to the state under protest. The trial court entered judgment for appellee. Appellant state comptroller contended that the trial court erred in voiding the franchise tax assessed against the percentage of appellee's taxable capital and measured by its gross receipts from business done in a federal enclave because such allocation was statutorily permitted. The court reversed and held that caselaw principles applicable to the oil and gas production tax were applicable with equal force to the franchise tax because the definition of &quot;income tax&quot; contained in 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 110(c) of the Buck Act, encompassed business-privilege taxes in both instances because each tax related to and was measured by income or receipts. The court noted that the Buck Act defined &quot;income tax&quot; in terms of a tax measured by either net income, gross income, or gross receipts and found that the legislative intent behind the Buck Act was to include any state tax within the definition of income tax within &sect; 110(c).</SPAN></P>
