</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff child filed a complaint alleging that defendants, physician and others, were guilty of negligence in the prenatal care of his mother and that, as a proximate result, he suffered serious and permanent injuries. The Third Circuit Court of Davidson County (Tennessee) denied the physician's motion for an order precluding expert testimony and held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-26-115(b) did not apply to causation experts. The physician appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to interrogatories, the child notified defendants that he expected to call two expert witnesses from New York and Washington D.C. to testify as to the causation of the child's injuries. The physician contended that the testimony should be excluded because the experts did not meet the geographical limitations of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-26-115(b) and the child contended that &sect; 29-26-115 did not apply to causation experts. The court reversed and remanded in part and affirmed in part. The court held that under &sect; 29-26-115 the child had the burden of proving all three elements of his malpractice cause of action specifically set out in &sect; 29-16-115(a) and that the evidence to establish each of these elements, including causation, had to come from witnesses meeting the geographical limitations of &sect; 29-16-115(b). Thus, the trial court erred in ruling that &sect; 29-26-115 did not apply to causation experts. However, it did not follow that the testimony of the child's experts should be excluded because nothing in &sect; 29-26-115 prohibited the use of relevant medical expert testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was vacated to the extent that it held that the statutory geographic limitations for expert witnesses was not applicable to a causation expert, but the order denying the physician's motion to exclude the child's expert testimony was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant alternate operator service providers (providers) sought review of a final order from the Tennessee Public Service Commission at Nashville, Tennessee, which directed local telephone companies to amend their billing procedures for long distance calls under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-5-322 (Supp. 1988).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the commission issued an order, which directed local telephone companies to amend their billing procedures for long distance calls, the providers sought review. The court struck the part of the final order which improperly regulated rates, modified the order, and remanded. No local exchange carrier was permitted to provide billing and collection services to a long distance service provider or carrier unless the long distance service provider or carrier established an account with the end user being billed by customer subscription, use of an inter-exchange carrier credit card, commercial credit card, or other evidence of customer choice of the particular long distance service provider or carrier, and the establishment of such an account was certified to the local exchange carrier. To the extent that the final order constituted rate regulation, it was arbitrary and capricious in that the commission did not have sufficient evidence to evaluate and establish rates. In all other respects, the order was within the statutory and constitutional authority granted to the commission under the relevant statutes and the Constitutions of Tennessee and the United States.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant ex-husband challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of Davidson County (Tennessee), which found in favor of petitioner ex-wife in her action under the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA). The ex-wife's petition was filed in Louisiana, where the parties' divorce had been granted, and was forwarded to the trial court in Tennessee where the ex-husband resided.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ex-husband sought review of the trial court's judgment ordering his payment of child support arrearages as well as future child support payments. The ex-husband contended the Tennessee trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction due to the absence of a judicial officer's signature on the order certifying the ex-wife's petition to the Tennessee court and that the trial court erred in refusing to consider the ex-wife's alleged interference with his visitation rights as a defense to the URESA support enforcement action. The court on appeal affirmed the trial court's judgment, concluding that (1) the issue of the omission of a Louisiana judicial officer's signature, as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1641, was waived because the ex-husband failed to raise that issue in the trial court proceeding; (2) the ex-wife's alleged interference with the ex-husband's visitation rights could not be raised as an equitable defense in the URESA action, and the sole issue for determination by the trial court in Tennessee as the responding state was enforcement of the previously established child support obligation; and (3) the trial court had authority to enforce the arrearage payments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant property owner challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of Washington County (Tennessee), which sustained the motion of defendant city to charge the costs the city incurred in abating an alleged public nuisance on the owner's property to the owner. The owner contended that the city court lacked jurisdiction to authorize the city's abatement of the nuisance and then to charge the costs incurred to the owner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city court found the owner guilty of violating Johnson City, Tenn., Mun. Code &sect; 15-297 for his storage of wrecked motor vehicles as a public nuisance and imposed a fine on the owner. The circuit court on the owner's de novo appeal found defendant guilty and ordered his abatement of the nuisance or his liability for the costs if the city abated the nuisance. The owner sought review of the circuit court judgment allowing the city to charge the cost to him. The owner also contended that, in the absence of authority by the city court, the circuit court hearing the matter de novo lacked the authority to grant the challenged relief. The court on appeal reversed that segment of the circuit court's judgment, concluding that the city court lacked the authority under 1939 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 189, &sect;&sect; (1), (2) to charge the abatement cost to the owner and that the circuit court's jurisdiction on appeal was only co-extensive with and not greater than the city court. The court determined that the effect of the circuit court's exceeding the jurisdiction of the city court rendered void all of the judgment exceeding the city court's imposition of a fine for the owner's ordinance violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that part of the circuit court's judgment that was determined to be void, affirmed the remainder of the judgment, and remanded the matter.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 47-25-101 et seq., and certain insurance statutes for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The optometrists, a Tennessee professional corporation, filed suit against the insurance company, a Georgia corporation, alleging an unlawful restraint of trade. The trial court dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, holding that the case fell within the reach of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.S. 1, because the dealings between the parties placed the case under the umbrella of interstate commerce and the Sherman Act gave federal courts exclusive jurisdiction. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that, although there were some intrastate implications, the critical point was that, to the extent intrastate commerce was affected by the actions of the insurance company, it was of a nature only incidental to the predominant agreement between a Tennessee corporation and a Georgia corporation. Therefore, a Tennessee state court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the matter. The court also rejected the optometrists' assertion that it could proceed under state insurance laws, stating that the allegations made by the optometrists did not support such a claim and, at least under one statute, the optometrists lacked standing.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed. Because the devisees resided outside the county, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 30-2-603 only required the clerk to give notice by publication. There was no proof that publication notice was given. In addition, notice by publication was not sufficient to comply with due process in this case because the devisees' names and addresses were known to the executors. Post-hearing notice did not satisfy due process. The only pre-hearing information given was the proposed final settlement, and the accompanying letter did not include information as to the date, time, or place of the hearing. The information was thus insufficient to give the devisees actual notice of the hearing. The finding of laches was erroneous because there was no showing that the delay prejudiced the executors' ability to produce evidence supporting the final settlement, and the record did not establish that the devisees acquiesced in the final settlement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The road at issue was a right-of-way acquired by the federal government when it acquired some of the owner's land for a radar base. Eventually the base was abandoned, and the government sold the land to grantees, who subdivided the land. The grantees and their subsequent transferees were granted a right-of-way over the road at issue for ingress and egress. The county road department had occasionally worked on the road prior to the passage of ch. 232, which maintenance allegedly served to make it a public road under ch. 232, &sect; 11. The trial court found that ch. 232 was not intended to make every road that had at any time been maintained by the county prior to its passage a public road and consequently dismissed the suit. The court affirmed, agreeing with the trial court's interpretation and also finding that the title of ch. 232 did not encompass such a method of acquiring a right-of-way. Further, as interpreted by the county, ch. 232, &sect; 11 was constitutionally suspect as taking private property without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

When the buyer took the new vehicle to the seller for work, the seller refused to return the vehicle until the buyer compensated the seller for fraud involving the trade-in vehicle. The buyer obtained a writ of possession with the surety acting as the buyer's surety, and the seller filed a third-party action against the buyer for fraud. The court entered a judgment in favor of the seller and held the surety liable. The surety sought review, and the court reversed. The court held that the surety only agreed to be liable on the writ of possession and not for all debts of the buyer. Also, the terms of the bond were not ambiguous because the bond clearly indicated the conditions under which the surety would be liable. The court remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The opponents argued that the rezoning resolution adopted by the county commissioners was void because: (1) the reselling of the tract was contrary to a comprehensive zoning plan; (2) the review was by certiorari and accordingly limited, and the trial court should have excluded all evidence offered by the county on matters not addressed by the county commission; and (3) the rezoning issue was not fairly debatable and, therefore, was an arbitrary act. The court said that the legislative body was not bound by any comprehensive plan, but had the power to deviate from it, if it chose, as long as it did not act unconstitutionally in so doing. The opponents sought a declaratory judgment of the validity of the rezoning, thereby activating Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 27-9-111, which provided that either party could introduce such evidence as it desired. A judicial inquiry into zoning matters was limited to determination of whether a rational basis existed for legislative action, and if the issue was fairly debatable, the inquiry ended. The question of whether the tract should have been rezoned was fairly debatable, and the court could not substitute juridical action for legislative discretion.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that when the commissioner sent out notices of a rulemaking hearing, which would address the commission's new rules regulating title insurance rates, the title companies were not included in the mailing. The court ruled that the trial court misinterpreted Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-5-203(d), by holding that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 56-35-122 only required that the written notice be sent, not received. The court ruled that the commission's evidence of notice was insufficient to support a presumption that notices were mailed in the usual course of business. The secretary who prepared the notices conceded that she had no independent recollection of preparing or mailing them. She also admitted that she could not describe the department's standard procedures for giving notice of a rulemaking proceeding because she had never sent out rulemaking notices before.

The court affirmed the judgment and held that: (1) the county was not immune from the provisions of the Hazardous Waste Management Act of 1983, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 68-46-201 et seq., which was enacted after the state's tort liability act and was therefore controlling; (2) the county was the property's owner despite the fact that it never recorded the deed, as the conditions of the release of the former owner's debt to the county created a presumption of acceptance of the deed, and there was no evidence of non-acceptance nor overt disavowal of ownership; and (3) the county was not denied due process, as there had been no adjudication as to the extent of the county's liability, only that the county owned the property and was subject to the reclamation procedures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents had a son who was placed in the care of the department because he was frequently absent from school.

Failure to comply with the order would terminate the parents right to their child. When the mother refused to accept treatment, the court ordered termination of the parent/child relationship. On appeal, the court set the judgment aside and sent the case back to the trial court. It held that the parent's rights could not be terminated in the absence of some willful act by the parents.

The mother did not contest the termination of her parental rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the parents were divorced, the children were removed from the mother's custody because of neglect. The father failed to comply with the foster care plans by failing to establish a stable home environment, failing to keep in touch with the Department, and changing jobs and residences frequently. The trial court found that there was clear and convincing evidence to terminate the father's parental rights pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 37-1-147(d), 37-2-403(a)(2), and on appeal, the court agreed. The children had been removed from the father for over a year, and the father's life-style would have reasonably subjected the children to neglect. Moreover, the father refused to attend counseling on parenting skills, and he had a problem with alcohol. Termination of the father's parental rights was in the best interest of the children under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 37-1-147(d). The father's failure to comply with the reasonable foster care plans supported the termination of his parental rights under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 37-2-403(a)(2), which indicated that the father was unfit to be a parent. Failure to comply with the plans was a proper basis for terminating the father's parental rights.</SPAN></P>

An administrative law judge (ALJ) of the Board held that &sect; 67-5-212(a)(1) was unconstitutional to the extent that it required a per se exemption of parsonages from property taxation. The Assessment Appeals Commission reversed the ALJ, and the Board affirmed the judgment of the Commission. Appellants contended that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-5-223, which authorized administrative agencies to promulgate a declaratory order as to the &quot;validity&quot; of a statute, bestowed upon the Board jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of a statute. The court found that administrative agencies did not have authority to decide constitutional questions. The word &quot;validity&quot; as used in &sect; 4-5-223 was not intended to give administrative agencies the power to determine constitutionality of State statutes. It was not necessary to exhaust administrative remedies pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-5-223 and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-5-224 before resorting to the Tennessee trial courts for adjudication of the constitutionality of a Tennessee statute.</SPAN></P>

Pub. Acts ch. 410 (Act).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner had assessed a severance tax against the taxpayer upon minerals severed from the ground for the year before the effective date of the Act. The commissioner contended that the Act became effective when a version of it had been enacted the year before. The court affirmed, finding that the chancellor had correctly held that taxing the taxpayer before the effective date of the statute would amount to taxing an act after the act had been performed. This amounted to imposing or creating a new obligation in respect to an act already passed. Thus, it would violate the prohibition against retrospective laws contained in the Tenn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20. The court found that 1984 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 953 was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority because when a law becomes effective could not be placed into the hands of counties or municipalities. Thus, to correct the perceived defects in ch. 953, 1985 Tenn. Pub. Acts. ch. 410 was enacted. The court found that ch. 410 was a completely new act and could not be used to retroactively tax transactions already performed prior to its effective date.</SPAN></P>

The Commission ordered the driver's license suspended for one year. The driver challenged the order of the Commission, which was affirmed by the trial court. The driver appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that a patrolman sitting as a magistrate in the Commission's hearing had not violated her due process guarantees of the U.S. Const. amend. V and XIV or of the U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8. The court stated that the highway patrol officer was not an investigator of the facts surrounding the driver's arrest and was merely determining if the driver refused to consent to the breath alcohol test and whether she was informed of the fact that her license would be suspended upon her refusal to consent. The signature of the officer that administered the test not being notarized at the time the officer signed it had not prejudiced the driver.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 8-35-303. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 49-5-203 and held that the county was obligated to honor a contract with the city employees after the city abolished its school system. The court modified the judgment and held that the county was required to provide former city employees the substantive rights they previously had under a repealed city charter. In all other respects, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Under &sect; 49-5-203, the former city teachers' rights were preserved after the school system was abolished. The county had no discretion in hiring or not hiring the former city employees and had no discretion regarding their tenure status. The city employees received comprehensive protection and continuity to their pension rights under City of Knoxville, Tenn., City Charter &sect; 1380.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Shelby County (Tennessee), which, upon a jury's verdict, entered judgment in favor of defendant purported father in a paternity action in which the mother alleged that defendant was the natural father of her two children. The trial court granted defendant's motion to exclude the results of certain blood grouping tests performed on the mother and children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One year after a motion by defendant to compel blood testing of the mother and children, the testing was conducted. The mother filed a motion to admit the results pursuant to recent amendments to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 24-7-112, as amended by 1983 Tenn. Pub. Acts 445. By the same motion, the mother also sought to have another amendment to &sect; 24-7-112, 1983 Tenn. Pub. Acts 459(3), declared unconstitutional. The trial court held that the challenged amendment was not unconstitutional and the blood test results would not be admitted into evidence. In affirming the decision, the court held that the mother failed to present on appeal the issue of the constitutionality of the amendment, and therefore, the mother had waived the presentation of the issue. Further, the court did not reach the mother's issue concerning the admission of the blood test results because the mother agreed that the results would be used at trial if, and only if, exclusion of defendant was established. The statement of evidence indicated that defendant could not be excluded as the father. Thus, the results did not conform to the terms of the stipulation between the parties, and the mother was bound by that stipulation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer challenged the lower court judgment as it affirmed the decision by appellees to terminate his employment.

In addition, the police officer asserted that appellees' actions deprived him of his employment without substantive and procedural due process under U.S. Const. Amend. XIV. The court held that the police officer's termination was proper because he was allowed a pre-discipline hearing and an exhaustive post-termination hearing. The police officer had notice of the charges and the opportunity to respond both by presenting his own witnesses and by cross-examination of the witnesses presented by appellees.

The father had filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the petition was barred by the doctrines of res judicata and/or collateral estoppel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children's mother had filed a petition in a juvenile court to establish paternity. The father filed a motion to dismiss the petition as barred by the then applicable two-year statute of limitations under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-2-103 (1975), and his motion for summary judgment was granted. The period ran from the date of birth of the children. The mother took no further action. The statute was amended to extend the limitations period of both the mother of a child and the TDHS to one year beyond the child's age of majority under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-2-103 (Supp. 1987). In reversing the decision, the court held that neither the doctrine of res judicata or collateral estoppel applied to the case. The first case was brought by the mother, not TDHS, and TDHS was not in privity with the mother. In addition, the issue of paternity was neither litigated nor decided on the merits because the action was dismissed as barred by the statute of limitations. Further, the amended &sect; 36-2-103 expressly authorized TDHS to institute a suit in its own name to establish paternity and that right was in no way dependent on the mother's right to bring the action.</SPAN></P>

The gas company argued that the matter was not res judicata and that the Commission's determination of the value of the municipal gas system was incorrect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The gas company was a public utility which purchased a municipal gas system. The exact cost of the system was unknown, but the gas company requested a statewide rate increase. The Commission determined that the value of the municipal system was lower than what the gas company claimed, and it denied the request. The gas company's motion to reconsider was rejected by the Commission. The gas company appealed, and a chancellor ruled in favor of the Commission, but the gas company voluntarily dismissed its appeal. The gas company filed a new rate petition, and the Commission denied it. The gas company petitioned for direct review, and the court remanded. The rulings of the Commission had no res judicata effect because they were never truly final and conclusive. In addition, the Commission in setting rates did not act in a judicial capacity. Therefore, the Commission was not bound by the chancellor's judgment for res judicata purposes. The Commission's refusal to allow the gas company to capitalize costs expensed in order to increase the book value of the municipal system was proper, but the Commission's order did not comply with Tenn.

The trial court dismissed the actions. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the possibility that the members of the labor union or the inmates might in the future have been transferred to a private facility that might possibly have been operated by a private contractor did not create a presently existing controversy as to which a declaratory judgment would have been in order. The statute related only to the possible operation of a correctional facility by a private contractor. It did not authorize a private contractor to operate the prison where the members of the labor union were employed or where the inmates were incarcerated. There was no showing of imminent, threatened, or even probable transfer of either the labor union members or the inmates to a private facility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Tennessee State Senator filed an action under the Declaratory Judgment Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 27-14-101 et seq., against defendants, various State officials, for a declaratory judgment contesting the constitutionality of 1986 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 866, commonly known as The Mandatory Seat Belt Law (Act). The Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) granted defendants' motion to dismiss the action. The Senator appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Senator alleged that the Act was unconstitutional for several reasons, one of which was that the provisions imposing fines for only second or subsequent violations would result in arbitrary enforcement, in violation of Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, because the law provided for penal sanctions only after a defendant had received previous warning citations and provided for no system for communicating the issuance of warning citations between various law enforcement authorities. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment dismissing the complaint. The court found that the Senator had alleged no right or interest which might be affected by the enforcement of the Act. Although the Senator was an alleged non-user of seat belts, even should he violate the Act, he could not be arrested unless he was apprehended for the violation of yet another law which might never occur. Also, the allegation that the Senator had received a warning citation from a police officer for violation of the Act was insufficient to give him standing to bring the action or to create a justiciable controversy because a citation could not result in any fine, penalty, confinement, or deprivation of any right.</SPAN></P>

The father denied paternity and sought a dismissal based upon the two-year statute of limitations set out in a relevant statute. The trial court declared the statute to be unconstitutional, and the state supreme court later upheld the constitutionality of the statute. Subsequently, the United States Supreme Court reversed the state supreme court's decision and remanded the cause. The case was later transferred to the chancery court for a jury trial on the issue of paternity. A verdict was returned finding the father to be the child's natural father. On appeal to the court, the trial court verdict was affirmed and the cause was remanded. The mother then filed a motion to set aside child support and attorney fees and to reduce arrearages to judgment. The trial court awarded the mother limited back child support from the date of the order that transferred the cause to the chancery court up to the child's 18th birthday. The court reversed in part the judgment, by holding that the mother was entitled to back child support from the time paternity was established.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners filed an application for extraordinary appeal from an order of The Chancery Court for Davidson County at Nashville (Tennessee) that overruled their motion to amend their complaint, which sought to set aside a tax deed executed to defendant purchasers. The action was remanded by the Supreme Court of Tennessee for the limited purpose of determining whether the property owners had received adequate notice of the tax sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the action was remanded, the property owners sought to amend their complaint in order to raise a constitutional attack on the procedures employed by the Attorney General (Tennessee) in conducting tax sales. The trial court, in denying the amendment request, relied upon the remand order from the Supreme Court, which limited the trial court to considering whether it was error to hold that the publication of notice of tax sale in a particular newspaper was adequate notice to the property owners when there was no evidence in the record on that issue and without permitting the introduction of such evidence in a trial on the merits. The court affirmed the judgment, explaining that neither a trial court nor an appellate court had the authority to expand a limitation placed by the Tennessee Supreme Court upon a remand. The court reasoned that the law of the case, which was established on appeal, controlled at later trials and appeals of the same case. The court emphasized that pleadings could not be amended after a cause had been remanded for a restricted purpose.</SPAN></P>

XI, &sect; 8 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Defendants claimed that the appeal was frivolous.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied his motion to continue the hearing and granted the summary judgment. On appeal the patient claimed that &sect; 29-26-115(b) was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment below, concluding that it was improper to raise the constitutionality issue for the first time on appeal. Further, he failed to notify the attorney general under Ten. R. Civ. P. 24.04. Denial of the continuance was not error because the patient had enough time to prepare his case. The court rejected the validity of the patient's affidavits, ruling that they were based on hearsay and that they failed to contradict defendants' affidavits. The court also held that medical malpractice actions that involved issues of negligence and proximate cause, as well as claims of injuries or infections, were not within common knowledge but required expert testimony. Because the patient failed to offer affidavits from medical experts to defend against the motions, summary judgment for defendants was proper.</SPAN></P>

The decision found that the retrospective application of an amendment to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 28-1-105 would disturb a vested right of the motorist.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Tenn. R. App. P. 9, the court granted an interlocutory appeal. The court found that the sole issue was whether the 1985 amendment to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 28-1-105, the savings statute, acted retrospectively. The savings statute provided that the jurisdictional limits of the general sessions court did not apply to actions originally commenced in general sessions court and subsequently recommenced pursuant to the statute in a circuit or chancery court. The statute in no way indicated that the claimant had to take a voluntary nonsuit in general sessions court in order not to be bound by that court's jurisdictional limit. The court held that statutes changing jurisdiction of a court were considered to be remedial in nature. The court concluded that the retrospective application of the 1985 amendment did not impair a vested right of the motorist and that the statute was constitutional under both the state and federal constitutions. Furthermore, the 1985 amendment in no way affected the merits of the case. It merely changed the monetary jurisdiction of the circuit court in cases commenced in general sessions court.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed as to the automobile engine, but affirmed as to the remainder of the automobile. The statute declared that vehicles on which the identification number had been altered were contraband subject to forfeiture. The body of the vehicle was not the body to which its vehicle identification number was originally attached. The transmission bore no number at all.

The suspension had been served.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An administrative law judge ruled that the applicant had not given false information on the application related to prior legal proceedings in which the applicant was a named party. However, on reconsideration of that administrative decision, the Commissioner of the Department of Commerce and Insurance, Tennessee, ruled that false information had indeed been given. Consequently, the Commissioner granted the license, but ordered a retroactive suspension to run concurrently with the time that the application had been pending. Thus, the applicant received the requested license, the suspension having been already served. The applicant unsuccessfully sought judicial review. The court affirmed on appeal, finding no error. The court found that the Commissioner, under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4-5-314 and 4-5-315, had timely reconsidered the action of the Securities Division. In any event, the action was moot because the applicant had received the license he sought.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for the Thirtieth Judicial District at Memphis (Tennessee) denying his application for writ of habeas corpus. Petitioner filed the writ with the trial court following a 10-day jail sentence handed down by the juvenile court. The juvenile court imposed the sentence pursuant to the findings and recommendations of its referee, a licensed lawyer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The referee found that petitioner, an adult, was able to comply with the juvenile court's previous order requiring him to pay child support, that he was able to work, and that he willfully refused to work in order to avoid his obligations. The referee recommended that petitioner serve 10 days in jail. This recommendation was confirmed in a decree by the juvenile court judge, a non-licensed lawyer. Petitioner claimed that under the Tennessee Constitution, a judge that was not licensed to practice law could not make any disposition of a juvenile that operated to confine him or deprive him of his liberty. Affirming, the court held that the mere adoption of the referee's findings by a non-licensed lawyer acting as a juvenile judge did not violate the Tennessee Constitution. Petitioner was properly tried before a lawyer referee, with appointed counsel at his side. The court further found that petitioner's right to refuse to testify against himself was violated at the criminal contempt hearing, however, his right to due process of law had been left unimpaired, and the error alleged was not jurisdictional or prejudicial to petitioner, therefore there was no ground for habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

The owners failed to appeal to the zoning board; they instead appealed to the chancery court. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and held that the owners were not entitled to a variance. The court noted that the owners did not seek relief or raise any issue, which they could not have raised in the city court or on appeal to the circuit court. The owners elected not to exercise their right to appeal the judgment handed down by the city court within 10 days. Instead, they permitted the time for appeal to expire and then filed suit seeking the same relief they could have sought in the circuit court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The land owner operated a large salvage yard; he attempted to expand operations on tract of land that lay within the regional planning zone of the city.

The trial court held that the board did not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner regarding its decision not to rezone the property. On further appeal by the land owner, the court affirmed the judgment. The court found no error in the chancellor's holdings, noting that the chancellor had transcripts of earlier proceedings and also heard extensive proof by numerous witnesses.

The trial court set aside the forfeiture because the commissioner had not rendered his opinion within the time limit contained in &sect; 4-5-314(g). The court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court held that it would review the action on its merits, even though the trial court had not decided the case thereon, because both the court and the trial court were to use the same standard to review an agency's determination. The commissioner's 251 day delay in rendering the forfeiture order was not prejudicial to the corporation. The corporation failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to the return of the truck.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the action by summary judgment on the basis that the judgment upholding the will in a previous will contest was res judicata. Prior to the filing of the action, a circuit court had determined the validity of the will. The previous contest had been filed by 12 different parties that were all relatives of the deceased. The contestant argued that he did not receive notice of the prior proceedings and claimed that the lack of notice deprived him of due process. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, finding that the contestant's averments of lack of notice did not establish a basis as a matter of law for voiding the circuit court judgment. In proceedings in rem, all persons in interest were parties, and all parties were presumed to have notice. Notice was served upon the thing itself. The court found that it was inappropriate to consider the contestant's challenge to the constitutionality of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 32-4-101 et seq. because the contestant raised the constitutional issue for the first time on appeal. No opportunity had been afforded for the introduction of evidence that might have been pertinent in determining the validity of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant alleged father sought review of a judgment of the Chancery Court of Putnam County (Tennessee), which admitted into evidence in a paternity case the results of blood grouping tests taken from appellee mother and the child, over the father's objection, and thus applied 1983 Tenn. Pub. Acts 459 and 1984 Tenn. Pub. Acts 971 retroactively as to the father.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother filed her complaint to establish paternity. The father requested, and received, an order requiring the mother and the child to submit themselves to a blood grouping test under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 24-7-112. The mother failed to comply with the order until nearly a year later. The blood grouping test established a 99.94 percent probability of paternity by the father, and the mother moved to have the results admitted into evidence under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-2-107 (1984). In affirming, the court found that the admission of the blood test results disturbed no substantive rights of the father that matured under prior law, but instead affected procedural, evidentiary proceedings. Thus, there was no constitutional violation. The chancery court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to dismiss the action because of the mother's failure to submit to the blood tests for a year. The mother had given a reasonable explanation in that she was forced to act without the advice of counsel for a period of time while a motion to disqualify her counsel was pending, and the circumstances indicated no occasion for fraud.</SPAN></P>

The churches each contributed money in order to defeat the referendum to a political campaign committee. However, none of the churches filed a campaign financial statement pursuant to the Act. The churches were notified that they had to comply with the provisions of the Act, but instead filed an action to declare the Act unconstitutional as applied to the churches. An agreed order was entered stating that the failure of the churches to file reporting and disclosure reports as required by the Act would not be considered as a willful violation. The trial court affirmed the constitutionality of the Act as applied to the churches. The court reversed and held that the Act was not applicable to the churches in a referendum election. The churches were political campaign committees within the meaning of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 2-10-102 (10) but because the risk of corruption was not present in a popular vote on a public issue the state failed to prove a compelling interest for the state imposed restrictions, including the statement of contributions, on freedom of speech.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the lower tribunals' decisions and found that the Board properly denied the claims because the dependants had received an amount greater than the maximum State employee death benefit as proceeds of life insurance that was paid for by State funds. Under &sect; 9-8-201, that was all that the dependents were entitled to receive. The chancery court did not err in holding that it lacked jurisdiction to review the Board's alleged misinterpretation of &sect; 9-8-201, which resulted in its denial of the claims. In oral argument, the representatives contended that the insurance was procured upon the decedents' lives without the required approval. Under the statute, it was unlawful to spend State money for insurance to protect the decedents without the approval of the Attorney General and the Commissioner of Finance, and the proceeds of any insurance bought with State funds with or without such approval reduced pro tanto the Board's award.</SPAN></P>

A jury returned a verdict for the mother. The father sought review, and the court affirmed. The court rejected the father's claim that blood test evidence was improperly admitted against him at trial. At the time that the case was filed, the court found that the statutes limited the admissibility of blood test evidence to cases in which exclusion was established. The court noted that those statutes were amended to allow for the admission of such evidence on the motion of either party, even if not exclusionary, where the trial court determined that the tests were of probative value. The trial court held that the amendments applied to allow admission of the blood test evidence, even though the statutes were amended after the action was filed. The father complained that this action violated Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, which precluded the retrospective application of a statute that created a new right or took away a vested right. Because the blood testing statutes were procedural, the court held that the father had no vested rights in the statute. Thus, the trial court's action was valid.</SPAN></P>

Further, the trial court did not err in disallowing cross-examination of the minor's expert witness concerning malpractice lawsuits against him because it was hearsay or in admitting the testimony of a nurse who alleged that the minor's medical records were altered, because the physicians failed to object to the testimony.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff father filed suit against defendant metropolitan government in the Circuit Court of Davidson County at Nashville (Tennessee) for emotional distress and lost opportunity to bury the body of his deceased son due to the failure of the metropolitan police department to deliver messages to the father's home regarding the death of his son. From a non-jury judgment in favor of the father, the government appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lifeless body of the father's son was found in his apartment in Los Angeles, California. The same day, the government's police department received a &quot;telex&quot; message about the death, requesting the department to notify the next of kin. A second request was sent two weeks later. About two months after the death, the Los Angeles coroner caused the body of the son to be cremated. The father first learned of the death of his son nine months later by letter from the Los Angeles coroner. The father suffered mental anguish as a result of losing the opportunity to conduct a normal funeral and burial of his son. The inquiry was whether the government was under any duty to the father to deliver the messages sent. The court held that the facts shown did not demonstrate actionable negligence. Stated otherwise, the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the father, did not support a judgment for the father. Stated in accordance with Tenn. R. App. P. 13(d), the uncontradicted evidence preponderated against the judgment of the trial judge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and the suit was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were divorced in Alabama. While an appeal was still pending in that state with regard to custody of the parties' minor child, the mother moved to Tennessee and filed a complaint in the trial court seeking custody. The trial court was initially of the opinion that it was proper to entertain the suit and entered a temporary order granting certain injunctive relief to the mother and reserving other matters until the final hearing. Thereafter, the Supreme Court of Tennessee issued an opinion relevant to the issue of jurisdiction. Based upon that opinion, the trial court entered an order declining to exercise jurisdiction. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that: (1) the general rule of retrospective application was appropriate in the instant case, and the exception was inapplicable; and (2) a change as to the authority of a Tennessee court to hear a case such as this was procedural and did not impair a vested right. In so holding, the court noted that the recent caselaw cited by the trial court was by a court of last resort while earlier, contrary caselaw was not and that the case at bar was a classic example of the type of case that the Act was enacted to resolve.</SPAN></P>

Appellees, a proposed developer and a property owner, had sought such a rezoning.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner held the title to the property at issue. The proposed developer had an option to buy the property if the property was rezoned as multi-family residential. The multi-family residential classification allowed 25 units per acre. The proposed developer had agreed to only 12 units per acre. The board had asked appellees to submit plans for the development. Appellees never complied. The board found that it could not enforce 12 units per acre. It denied the requested rezoning. The chancery court found that the board's decision was not fairly debatable in that it was arbitrary and capricious. On appeal, the court reversed the chancery court's ruling and remanded the case. The court found that the board's decision denying the rezoning was fairly debatable because it was supported by substantial evidence in the record. Therefore, the court reinstated the board's decision. Appellees then filed a motion to consider post-judgment facts, arguing that while the case was pending, the board rezoned the property to single family dwellings without a request to do so. The court denied the motion because the arguments were for a separate legal action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To secure payment of a note, the mortgagor executed a trust deed that provided that on default, the mortgagor waived equity of redemption. After the property was foreclosed on, the purchasers at the foreclosure sale sold the property to the subsequent purchasers for a profit. the mortgagor sought to exercise his statutory right of redemption under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 66-8-101 and tendered into court the price paid at the foreclosure sale and interest. The chancery court held that the mortgagor was not entitled to redemption because he did not tender the price paid by the subsequent purchasers. On appeal, the court held that application of 1984 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 774 to interpret the mortgagor's waiver of &quot;equity of redemption&quot; as a waiver of the statutory right of redemption violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Tenn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20, barring legislation that impaired the obligation of contracts. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 66-8-106 required the mortgagor to pay to purchasers at a foreclosure sale or to anyone claiming under those purchasers the amount bid or paid by the purchasers at the sale. Under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 66-8-112, the mortgagor was entitled to recover rent.</SPAN></P>

On remand, a rental amount was to be determined as well as damages owed to the subsequent purchasers by the purchasers at the foreclosure sale. A subsequent petition to rehear was overruled.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded for a redetermination of custody. The court held that the trial court erred in basing its custody determination at least in part on the tender years doctrine, as the supreme rule in custody cases to which all others yielded was the welfare and best interest of the child.

Code Ann. &sect; 46-2-101, which authorized the City's acts, was unconstitutional. The City Council and state senator moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim and for failure to timely perfect the appeal. The State moved to dismiss the constitutional claim. The trial court dismissed the complaint and plaintiffs appealed. The court found that there was no genuine issue of fact as to whether there fraud by the partnership or its members. The court found that the requirements for organization of a cemetery company had to be met prior to engaging in cemetery operations, and not prior to obtaining the land or a variance. The court found that the provisions of the Act were not broader than the caption and the Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act allowed landowners to apply to the county tax assessor for a classification of their property as agricultural, forest, or open space land to which the value for tax assessment purposes was to be calculated based, inter alia, on farm income, soil productivity or fertility, or topography, rather than on its fair market value. Appellants contended that the Act violated, inter alia, Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 28 that set forth classifications for real property and provided that farm property was to be assessed at 25 percent of its value. The trial court dismissed the action and the court affirmed. The court held that the Act was constitutional because &sect; 28 did not prohibit the legislature from creating subclasses of real property and the restricted use of the property under the Act resulted in the same values as any other similarly classified property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the widow and mother of decedents, appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Davidson County (Tennessee), which granted a motion for summary judgment filed by defendant, a prior owner of land, in plaintiff's action for the wrongful death of her husband and two children by drowning.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On June 2, 1981, plaintiff's husband and two children were drowned in a flooded culvert near their home. Defendant had owned the land, which he sold on March 31, 1977. While he owned the land, he had contracted for the construction of the culvert, which was part of a drainage system. The system was maintained by defendant after its construction until he sold the land. Plaintiff's complaint alleged that defendant had negligently designed and constructed the culvert and was liable as a landowner for the unreasonably dangerous condition. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment on the ground that it was barred by the four-year statute of limitations in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 28-3-202. The court held that it was uncontroverted that, on March 31, 1977, when defendant sold the property, the construction thereon was complete. The defect in the drainage was latent and defendant was unaware of the defect. Also, he had no connection with the property after March 31, 1977. The limitation period in &sect; 28-3-202 began to run on March 31, 1977, when he completed the work and sold the land. Because the decedents died more than four years after that date, the suit was barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and remanded the cause for the collection of costs and any other necessary proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court issued a writ of attachment, signed by the Circuit Court Judge for Sevier County, to the Sheriff of Bradley County, directing him to attach the property located in Bradley County. The sureties claimed, among other things, that the creditor never served a summons on the creditors, and the record failed to reflect the order of publication for the writ, or publication itself. The court held that the attachment was void in its inception. Under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 20-4-103, in an action commenced by the attachment of property without personal service of process, and in cases where suit was brought to obtain possession of personal property, or to enforce a lien or trust deed or mortgage, or where it related to real property, the attachment may have been sued out or suit brought in any county where the real property, or any portion of it was located. The creditor's bill of attachment should have been brought in Bradley County.

The trial court entered a judgment of paternity against the father and ordered the father to pay the mother's deposition expenses under Tenn. R. Civ.

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision to allow the mother to introduce the director's deposition into evidence.

The assistant superintendent was protected by the private act and under an employment contract between the county education association and the board. On appeal, the board and the superintendent argued that the private act was contrary to the general education law and was therefore unconstitutional, because Tenn. Const. art.

Code Ann. &sect; 6-52-301 et seq., ch. 116, 1983 Tenn. Pub. Acts, for failing to exercise certain corporate powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged that a forfeiture of the city's charter was warranted because the city failed to exercise certain corporate powers. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment that refused to declare the forfeiture. The court concurred with the chancellor's finding that, at the enactment of the Act, grounds already existed for the forfeiture of the city's charter. However, the court disagreed with the chancellor's ruling that the Act did not constitutionally apply to such pre-existing grounds. The issue on appeal is whether the Act penalized omissions which occurred prior to the enactment of the Act and, if so, whether the Act violated Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. The court held that as applied, the clear meaning and intent of the Act was that if, prior to the effective date of the Act, the city had failed to exercise its powers as set out Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-52-302, it was subject to forfeiture. The court also held that as interpreted the Act did not violate Tenn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20, which prohibited retrospective laws. The court concluded that Act did not purport to impair any contractual or vested rights retroactively and was therefore not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife brought a house to the marriage, and she placed it her name and the husband's name after the parties' marriage.

The trial court applied &sect; 36-5-101 retroactively and awarded the wife temporary support although the husband was granted a divorce. The husband was also granted a portion of the house by the trial court. The court reversed in part, modified in part, and affirmed in part, holding that &sect; 36-5-101 could not be retroactively applied because it created a new right and, thus, its retroactive application violated Tenn.

In February of 1984, the matter came to trial and the trial court admitted over the objection of the alleged father the deposition of a doctor in which he stated that blood tests revealed that there was a 99.79 per cent chance that the alleged father was the father of the child. A jury returned a verdict in favor of the mother and the alleged father sought review, arguing that the blood tests should not have been admitted. On appeal, the court held that the applicable law was the former Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-228 which applied to paternity actions filed prior to July 1, 1983 and which only allowed blood tests at the request of the defendant and only in cases where exclusion was established. The statute was not unconstitutional because it applied indiscriminately to all cases pending before its amendment took place. The blood tests were improperly admitted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father, a Vietnam veteran who had lost both legs, an arm, and an eye, received $ 3500 a month from the Veterans Administration and Social Security. The Veterans Administration had allotted $ 90 per month as benefits to his two minor children. The trial court ordered the father to pay $ 800 per month child support. The father argued that the trial court was without authority to order him to pay child support from monies received from the Social Security Administration and the Veterans Administration and that the Veterans Administration had already determined that the children were entitled to $ 90 per month. The mother urged the court to grant her attorney's fees. The court affirmed the order of child support, holding that such support was an obligation growing out of parental status and public policy, not a debt; therefore, Veterans Administration funds and Social Security payments could be used to pay support under a child support order. The court concluded that the father should be given a credit for the $ 90 per month paid by the Veterans Administration and that the trial court should determine whether the mother was entitled to attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners petitioned the trial court for a statutory writ of certiorari to review the city council's action. The trial judge ruled that review could only be had by common law writ of certiorari. It found that the city council's decision was not illegal, arbitrary, or capricious. The court said that review under the common law writ of certiorari, pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 27-8-101, was limited to whether an inferior board or tribunal had exceeded its jurisdiction or had acted illegally, arbitrarily, or capriciously. Review under the statutory writ at Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 27-8-102 was by trial de novo. Legislative enactments were tested by declaratory judgment. The action by the city council was not legislative because the proposed subdivision, although its lots were smaller than its neighbors, conformed to the existing zoning regulations and no change was sought in those rules. Moreover, the case was accompanied by a record of the evidence and proceedings before the land use control board, as was typical in an administrative action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant would unhitch the trailer and drive the tractor to his home. Defendant asserted that he was not violating the town's ordinance because he was using the tractor for personal use and not for commercial transportation once he dropped off the trailer. Defendant also argued that the ordinance was vague and overbroad and denied equal protection. On appeal, the court disagreed. The truck did not lose its status as a &quot;commercial vehicle&quot; when the tractor was temporarily detached and driven to defendant's home. The purpose of the ordinance was to deter damage to city streets. That purpose applied regardless of where defendant was headed. The court further noted that the storage of the tractor meant that it was used &quot;for trade or commerce&quot; within the town, that the ordinance was not limited to trucks passing through, or that the truck was not for &quot;inconsequential private use&quot; or fell within an exception for loading and unloading. Moreover, the ordinance did not discriminate against certain types of vehicles or unfairly grant an exception for school buses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 2-5-205 (1979) candidates could obtain a place on the ballot by two avenues. The first was by the Secretary if he, in his sole discretion, determined that a candidate was advocated or recognized in the national news media throughout the United States. The second was by a petition that was signed by 2,500 registered voters of the party whose nomination was sought. The Secretary refused to place the candidate's name on the ballot based on national recognition, but instead of attempting to get on by petition the candidate brought the action and sought a declaration and a mandatory injunction. On review the court held that dismissal was proper. The court noted that the courts had drawn the line on deciding hypothetical, academic, or abstract questions and there had to be a showing of a substantial controversy between parties having adverse legal interests, or sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant a declaratory judgment. Because the case lost its character by the passing of the primary election, there was no present, live controversy, the question involved was deprived of its practical significance, and the question was moot or academic.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 49-3-101, et seq., were in violation of the Constitution of the State of Tennessee in that it unlawfully provided for the taxation of property on a discriminatory basis. The Chancery Court of Anderson County (Tennessee) granted the County summary judgment, and the taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The County had raised the issue of the taxpayer's standing to bring suit. The court held that the taxpayer had standing, since his allegations fairly alleged the county was acting without authority to impose an unlawful tax or increase his tax burden. In addressing the merits, the court found that there were three school systems in Anderson County, the County school system and that of two cities. One of those cities operated schools educating students in grades K through six. Since that city did not undertake to educate its residents in grades seven through 12, the County did so. The second city provided schools for all grades. The taxpayer alleged the levies on two bonds were discriminatory because they were not imposed on all residents of the county, including the two cities. The court, in affirming the decision, found that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 49-3-1005(b)(1) provided an exemption to those property owners living in municipalities which operated school districts independent of the county school district, in order to prevent the inequity of double taxation. The statutory scheme provided a flexible method for financing the needs of the school system and was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner former wife challenged a decree from the Chancery Court, Part II, of Hamilton County (Tennessee), which denied the former wife's claims against respondent former husband for child support and medical expenses after the parties' child reached the age of 18 and for payment of the child's educational expenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former wife filed an action against the former husband under the Uniform Enforcement of Judgments Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 26-6-101 et seq., to enforce a Georgia divorce decree and recover child support, medical expenses, and educational expenses. The trial court found that the former husband was liable for all child support and medical expenses up to the time that the child reached her majority. The court held, however, that it was without jurisdiction to award child support and medical expenses for the child after she became 18 years of age and that the foreign judgment was not final and enforceable with regard to the child's educational expenses. The former wife appealed, and the court reversed the judgment in part. The court concluded that, under Georgia law, child support and medical expenses could be enforced after the child reached the age of 18. The court held that the trial court erred in not considering the claim for educational expenses that the child incurred prior to and after she reached her majority. A legitimate dispute as to what expenses were chargeable to educational expenses under the decree did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction over the matter.</SPAN></P>

The court modified the decree and remanded the case for a determination of child support and medical expenses and the educational expenses, if any, to which the child was entitled. The court affirmed the decree to the extent that it was not modified.</SPAN></P>

The father contended that the prior order that increased the amount of child support was invalid because it did not bear the personal signature of the trial court judge. In addition, the father contended that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-5-219 was invalid because it was inconsistent with Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8. The court affirmed the trial court judgment because there was no rule of law that prohibited the trial court judge from affixing a stamp of his name as his signature on the prior child support order. The court presumed that the evidence presented before the trial court and referee was properly introduced and warranted the judgment entered because the father failed to file a statement of evidence or a transcript of the proceedings for proper review.

Gov't Nashville &amp; Davidson County, Tenn., Ordinance 77-649, adult entertainment was limited to certain districts, and a 1,000 foot dispersal restriction prevented adult entertainment in the proximity of churches and schools. After appellant filed an action challenging the ordinance's constitutionality, the trial court held unconstitutional that part of the ordinance which restricted adult entertainment to certain districts. However, the trial court applied the elision doctrine and found the ordinance's 1,000 foot dispersal restriction to be constitutional. Thereafter, appellant sought review, claiming that the trial court erred in applying the elision doctrine. Upon review, the court held that the ordinance's unconstitutional provisions could be elided in the absence of a severability clause. In upholding the elision doctrine's applicability, the court held that the 1,000-foot dispersal restriction was not dependent upon and inter-related with the unconstitutional provision.

Code Ann. &sect; 57-3-208 (Supp. 1984) for the applicant to seek a retail liquor license with the state Alcoholic Beverage Commission (ABC). The applicant filed the action pursuant to &sect; 57-3-208(d).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city refused to grant the certificate under a city ordinance that restricted the number of retail liquor stores in the city to four, the number then existing. The applicant alleged that the ordinance was arbitrary and capricious and violated the Tennessee Constitution. He prayed that the ordinance be declared invalid and that he be issued the certificate. Proof at trial included testimony concerning the location of the existing retail stores, their availability to the citizens of the city and the surrounding trade area, the circumstances concerning the passage of the original ordinance, and various rules and regulations of the ABC. The chancellor concluded that no individual citizen would have to drive more than two miles to a retail liquor store, that there was a ratio of one retail store per 2,700 persons in the city, and that there was no arbitrary or capricious action of the city in limiting the number of stores. The court upheld the judgment granted to the city. The legislature was allowed to regulate liquor under its broad police power, and that power was properly delegated to the city. The city had not unreasonably restricted the availability of alcoholic beverages.</SPAN></P>

The issue was whether a contractor had a vested right to bid on municipal contracts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City appealed to determine the validity of a city ordinance empowering the City to &quot;debar&quot; or prevent from bidding on municipal contracts any person convicted of certain criminal acts after January 1, 1979. The prospective bidders were barred because of convictions for bid rigging. The court found that &quot;a new disability in respect of transactions or considerations already passed&quot; did not apply to the instant case. The parties agreed there was no executory contract between the City and a prospective bidder which was affected by the ordinance. The court opined that if the opportunity to bid was a vested right, then the ordinance had impaired that right and had to be declared void, but if the opportunity to bid was a mere expectancy, a contingent right, or a privilege, then the ordinance was valid. The court held that the ordinance neither impaired a vested right nor imposed a new disability on a contractual obligation, so it was not constitutionally infirm. The court concluded that the chancellor erred when he found the ordinance in conflict with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 12-4-601 because the ordinance, by its own terms, had no application if the state decided to invoke the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, and it dismissed the case, dividing costs equally among the prospective bidders.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected plaintiffs' continuing treatment theory. The court found no evidence of a continuing trust and confidence in the hospital for treatment or of continuing negligent treatment by the hospital; no expert evidence with respect to the alleged continuing negligent treatment; and no evidence of fraudulent concealment of the fact of erroneous diagnosis. The court ruled that it was forbidden from considering the constitutional question because it was not presented to the trial court.

The court affirmed, holding in its de novo review that the testimony of the caseworkers and the guardian ad litem as to the children's physical and living conditions supported the termination. Also, the adoptive home was stable and the children seemed to have adjusted well while there. The court also relied on the guardian ad litem's report, which cited specifically the dangerous physical conditions, the parents' limited mental abilities, and the parents' lack of efforts to remedy the problem areas. Further, termination was appropriate given the factors in &sect; 37-246.

An award of child support was not precluded by the wife's previous agreement and the action of the trial court was correct insofar as it awarded child support. However, knowing the proclivities of normal 15 year old children, the court found it difficult to accept the trial court's order that a child of that age should directly receive $ 60 per week to provide for her own necessities. The court ordered that, on remand, the clerk of the court be directed to pay the child support payments to the wife for the use and benefit of the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, but remanded to require that child support payments be made to the wife and not the child.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and remanded the case finding that the department's decision was based upon substantial evidence within the meaning of Tenn. Code Ann. 59-1045. The court reasoned that there was sufficient cause to arrest, that the driver was arrested and offered a breath test that he refused. The court also rejected the driver's argument that procedural irregularities required that his driving privileges be reinstated. The court reasoned that the driver and his counsel participated fully in the hearing and raised no issues. However, the court did find that the trial court improperly failed to entertain the driver's constitutional challenges to the implied consent law under Tenn. R. App. P. 36(a). The court reasoned that the administrative agencies were ill equipped to handle such claims and further, such claims could be raised at any time.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association contested the application presented to the board of zoning appeals for approval of construction adjacent to the association. The court had, in a separate case, affirmed the chancellor's ruling on appeal permitting the construction. Instead of contesting that decision, the association brought a declaratory action pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-14-10 et seq. The association contended that the makeup of the board, by having members serve on another board, was illegal. The court affirmed the dismissal, finding that the declaratory judgment action was improper. The declaratory judgment act was designed to settle controversies before they reached other tribunals and was not intended to usurp the prerogatives of a tribunal before which a proceeding was pending or attacking the decision of another tribunal where adequate means of review were available. The court determined that it was not necessary to invalidate every decision of the boards because proper procedure would require that the association specify the action to be invalidated and make all persons interested parties to the suit. It was necessary to show which members of the boards were incompetent and why.</SPAN></P>

However, the cashier refused to accept their check because it was a few dollars short of the full amount. The cashier suggested that the customers go inside and make arrangements for partial payments. They declined to do so because they were anxious to go away on a trip. Their service was terminated that day, and as a consequence, the plumbing in their home froze and resulted in extensive property damage. They sued for wrongful termination of service.

The action originated under the &quot;contested cases&quot; provision of the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4-5-108 to 4-5-120, by which the employee challenged his dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee argued that no substantial or material evidence supported the action of the chancellor and that the chancellor erred in not admitting into evidence a letter written by the employer's counsel to the district attorney general after the hearing before the hearing examiner. In affirming, the court could not say that the decisions of the employer and the chancellor were unsupported by evidence that was both substantial and material. Furthermore, a concurrent finding between the agency and the trial court on any issue of fact was conclusive upon the court. It was clear that the chancellor had concurred in the finding of the employer that, insofar as drug transactions between the employee and another employee were concerned, the other employee testified truthfully at the hearing. Thus, that finding was binding on the court. The court concluded that the chancellor was correct in refusing to admit the letter into evidence because it did not in any way affect the merits of the case against the employee, and, as it was not part of the record in the administrative hearing, it did not qualify in the exception for the taking of additional evidence under Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The church corporation was organized as a local church of the United Presbyterian Church of the United States and acquired three tracts of real estate, by three separate deeds.

The grantees of the two remaining tracts were the trustees of the local church. The congregation of the local church decided to withdraw from the fellowship and conveyed all three tracts to the church corporation. The court concluded that (1) the deed conveying the property to the trustees under the care of the United Presbyterian Church of the United States implied a trust in favor of the general church, and that this tract of land was properly the property of those remaining loyal to the denomination; and (2) as to the other tracts, there was no language in the deeds or other instruments that implied a trust, and therefore ownership of these two tracts was properly vested in the church corporation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Amusement Tax Act imposed taxes upon any amount paid for admission to any place of amusement. The taxpayer owned and operated a chair lift and gondola system at the 1982 World's Fair and was required to pay an amusement tax by the city. The taxpayer sought to recover the tax, contending that the chair lift and gondola were not places of amusement, but rather transportation. The city claimed that notwithstanding the fact that the system may have been utilized for transportation, the system also provided amusement and was taxable under the Amusement Tax Act. The trial court found in favor of the city, but the court reversed. The court concluded that the real purpose of the system was to provide transportation. The record established that a need for a transportation system existed, a transportation system was installed, and the system was in fact utilized as a transportation system by the fair authorities. Just because those facilities were located within a place of amusement did not render them places of amusement.

On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly denied the grandparent's petition. Specifically, the court held that since the Tennessee adoption statute provided for notice to and consent by the natural parents of the child to be adopted, the court found no infirmity in the statute, constitutionally or otherwise, in its failure to extend that notice to the grandparents. Furthermore, the court rejected the grandparent's argument that they should have been permitted to intervene in the adoption proceedings after the court held that there was nothing in the statute granting the grandparent's that right.

Code Ann. &sect; 9-8-207(d)(2). He then filed a petition for writ of certiorari from the Board's decision claiming that the Board exceeded its statutory authority by improperly construing the time the action accrued. On appeal from the judgment dismissing his action, the court affirmed, holding that, based on Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 20-13-102(a), the trial court did not have jurisdiction and properly dismissed the suit. There was no exception to the rule that the State could be sued only with its consent, even in civil rights matters. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 9-8-207(a) provided that the Tennessee Board of Claims was to hear allegations of deprivation of rights secured by the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent, a patient at a state mental hospital, drowned on July 25, 1978, while on an outing supervised by hospital employees. On July 24, 1979, petitioner's counsel filed an unsworn wrongful death complaint with the Board. Petitioner's counsel was informed of the omission of his oath the next day, but did not file a sworn affidavit in support of the complaint until July 30, 1979. The Board disallowed the claim because no sworn petition was filed within one year from the date on which the cause of action accrued as required by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 9-8-207. The chancellor affirmed. On appeal, the court rejected the father's claim that the unsworn complaint constituted substantial compliance with &sect; 9-8-207, noting that legislative enactments permitting suits against the State of Tennessee, being in derogation of the sovereign immunity exemption from suits, were strictly construed. The court also ruled that the father's claim that &sect; 9-8-207 was unconstitutional was without merit because the bar imposed by a duly enacted and reasonable statute of limitations did not deprive the father of his day in court in derogation of his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

Injunctive relief was granted pending an administrative hearing, where a chancellor upheld the revocation pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-5-116 but declined to dismiss the case.

The permittees had no standing to challenge the remaining provisions of &sect; 39-6-609(b)(2) because they no longer qualified for permits, and the secretary's decision was supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

It sought a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was unconstitutional and an injunction against its enforcement. The trial court found in favor of the city, and the company appealed. The court noted that the projected expenses for enforcing the ordinance exceeded the projected amount of fees collected and that the fees bore a reasonable relation to the expenses involved, even though the fees were different than those charged for a variety of other items such as vending machines, laundry machines, restaurants, and snack bars.

The court upheld the trial court judgment and remanded to the trial court. The court found that from all of the testimony, it would jeopardize the welfare of the child to vest custody with the wife because the record indicated the husband was the most stable and emotionally mature parent at the time. The court held that it was not necessary to find that the ex-wife was unfit in order to award custody of child to the husband and that the child's best interests were served by the award of custody to the husband, with liberal visitation to the wife. The court reasoned that the trial court was in a far superior position to assess the qualities of the parties because of the ability to view the witnesses and assess their demeanor, mannerisms, and characteristics not apparent in the transcript.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dealer was issued a state permit to sell fireworks subject to any valid private act or municipal ordinance prohibiting or restricting the sale or use of fireworks. The dealer filed an application for a restraining order to prevent the police department from carrying out threatened arrests of the dealer's employees for the violation of Nashville, Tenn., Metro. Code &sect; 17-2-46. The trial court denied the restraining order on the grounds that 1947 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 58 applied. The court reversed and dismissed the case. The Act had been declared constitutional by the Supreme Court of Tennessee, and the words &quot;possess&quot; and &quot;use&quot; were in the act when its constitutionality had been declared. The court rejected the dealer's contentions that Tenn. Const. art. 11, &sect; 9 (effective November 19, 1953) operated in an ex post facto manner to create an infirmity of constitutional magnitude in the Act or that the passage of the General Fireworks Statute, Tenn.

The city argued that, because the annexation was by referendum, as provided in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 6-51-104, 6-51-105, rather than by adoption of an ordinance pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 6-51-102, 6-51-103, the court did not have jurisdiction to review the annexation by referendum because Tennessee statutes expressly authorized court review only in annexation by ordinance cases.

The jury in the trial court found that the putative father was the father of the child and defendant's motion to set aside the jury verdict or, alternatively, for a new trial, was overruled. The court held that &sect; 36-224 clearly stated that the Department was permitted to establish paternity at any time while the child was a minor if the child was a public charge or was liable to become a public charge at the time the proceeding was instituted; therefore, defendant's contention that the Department's action should have been dismissed because the child was not a public charge at the time was without merit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The managing partner employed the representative on behalf of the partnership to sell the partnership and its assets. Under a proposed contract submitted by a buyer, the representative was to receive a commission from the total purchase price that included a building and real estate. The partnership refused to close the sale. The representative filed suit to recover the commission, but the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of defendants. On appeal, the court affirmed. The representative was not a licensed real estate broker and had not applied for such a license. Under the Tennessee Real Estate Broker Licensing Act of 1973, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 62-1302 et seq., the representative could not recover any commission. The representative was required to have a broker's license even if the sale was an isolated act. The almost licensed doctrine did not apply because the evidence showed that the representative had only made a single phone call the licensing authority to inquire as to whether he needed one. There was no evidence of fraud on the part of the partnership or other parties.</SPAN></P>

Priv. Acts, ch. 181 unconstitutional because it offended Tenn. Const. art. 11, &sect; 8 that required the enactment of general laws and forbid invidious discriminatory class legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The private act authorized the board of county commissioners to create a county planning commission and vested the proposed commission with all of the authority, duties, and responsibilities granted to regional planning commissions by various sections of the Tennessee Code Annotated and with sole and exclusive planning and platting authority within a region, including the entire county except for the territory within the municipal limits of incorporated municipalities. The trial court determined that the private act circumvented Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 13-1-106 that allowed for the creation of regional planning commissions and stripped the cities' regional planning commissions of power that they had been granted by the general law. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment in favor of the cities and their regional planning commissions. The general law was mandatory. There was no evidence to support the county's argument that there was a reasonable basis for treating the county different from other areas. The private act was unconstitutional because it offended an obligatory general law that created a uniform state policy for the creation of regional planning commissions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action brought against defendants, the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County (Metro) and various state officials, plaintiff liquor store owner appealed from the judgment of a trial court (Tennessee), which upheld the constitutionality of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 57-3-205 and Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Tenn., Code &sect; 5-2-3(1) (1977) and which upheld Metro's denial of a certificate of compliance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under &sect; 5-2-3(1), liquor stores were permitted only in urban services districts and within satellite cities within the county. The owner was denied a certificate on the sole basis that the proposed location for the liquor store was outside of the Metro Urban Services District. The owner contended that such restriction was unreasonable, but the trial court found, and on appeal, the court agreed, that lack of adequate police protection in the General Services District provided a reasonable basis for the restriction. The court rejected the owner's argument that the entirety of the county, and not simply the Urban Services District, was a municipality within the definition of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 57-3-101, and thus the General Services District was not a civil district in which retail liquor sales were permitted under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 57-3-108. Equal protection was not violated by the geographical restrictions because the equal protection clause related to equality between persons, rather than between areas. Finally, while other boundaries could have been just as legitimately drawn, it was sufficient that the geographical restriction was reasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which upheld the constitutionality of the subject statutes and ordinances, and which upheld the denial of the certificate, and remanded the matter to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 33-604 (Cum. Supp. 1982). Respondent's discharge from the mental facility did not render her appeal moot because, based on her history of brief hospitalizations and the likelihood that she would be hospitalized again, the appeal was capable of repetition, yet evading review. The court affirmed the order of commitment finding that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination did not apply to statements made by respondent to an examining psychiatrist because the judicial hospitalization proceeding was civil in nature. The purpose of such proceedings was to provide medical treatment for the mentally ill and any deprivation of liberty was part of that treatment. Respondent was not denied the right to confront the witnesses against her because, although hearsay evidence was erroneously admitted without any attempt to bring it within the exception provided by the Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act, Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During his tenure, the clerk also acted as clerk of the court of general sessions. After he left his position, he sued to recover additional salaries for his additional role, arguing that, under the statute providing for compensation of the clerk of the general sessions court, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 18-4-201, the county was required to supplement the fees earned by his office to pay him the maximum salary specified by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 8-22-102. The court disagreed, stating that its reading of the statutes was that, if the fees from all the clerk's offices were not sufficient to pay the minimum salary, the county was required to supplement them to bring his salary to the minimum level. If the total fees from all his offices were equal to or greater than the statutory minimum, then the county had no requirement to supplement fees, but the clerk was permitted to retain fees as salary up to the statutory maximum. The court held that the clerk was not entitled to any relief because the county was not required to guarantee the clerk the maximum statutory salary if the fees from his offices as circuit court and general sessions clerks did not reach that amount.</SPAN></P>

Although the husband was paid workers' compensation benefits for his wife's death, he filed a common law action against the employer for the wrongful death of his wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties entered into a stipulation of facts. The employee, while acting within the scope of her employment, was abducted from the convenience store, in a robbery attempt and later killed. The husband acknowledged that prior existing authority in the appellate courts upheld the constitutionality of the exclusivity provisions of &sect; 50-908. Section 50-908 provided that the rights and remedies granted to the employee subject to the Workmen's Compensation Law due to personal injury or death by accident excluded all other rights and remedies of the employee, his personal representative, dependents, or next of kin, due to such injury or death. Because the issue before the court had been passed on by the Supreme Court of Tennessee, the court was not at liberty to depart from precedent decisions. The husband argued that the trial court erred in failing to hear testimony on whether the employer had knowledge of an unusual danger of assault upon its employees and was liable for its failure to warn. The stipulation was entered into in lieu of producing live testimony on the facts. The husband was not allowed to take a position on appeal inconsistent with that taken in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court, after a trial on the merits, entered judgment for appellee out-of-state resident (resident) and counter defendant. The trial court allowed the litigants' attorney to withdraw the day of trial without objection from the litigants. The litigants' motion for new trial was overruled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue on appeal was whether the trial judge erred in refusing to grant the litigants' motion for continuance. The resident filed the action in February 1977. The case was set for trial in January 1981. At the litigants' request the case was continued to March 2nd and then to March 30th 1981, due to one litigant's service in the legislature. At the March 30th trial date, the same litigant sought a continuance on his own behalf as a member of the legislature. After considering that for the second time the resident had traveled from out-of-state and was prepared for trial whereupon that same morning the litigants filed for a continuance, the trial court denied the continuance. The court affirmed, holding that where the litigant stated that he was a member of the legislature and was unable to try the case in one day and that he needed a continuance, the litigant's request fell short of the statutory minimum which would be necessary to bring the litigant within Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 20-7-106.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient sought review of the decision of the trial court (Tennessee), which entered a directed verdict for defendant doctor in the patient's medical malpractice action for injuries sustained by the patient when she jumped from the window of her hospital room.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was admitted to the hospital for her psychotic condition. The doctor prescribed medication and put her on a suicide watch. The patient, however, jumped from her second story hospital room and suffered severe injuries. During trial, the patient offered expert testimony of a non treating doctor who specialized in psychiatry. The defendant doctor specialized in the field of internal medicine and cardiology. The trial court admitted the testimony and then directed a verdict in favor of the doctor. The court reversed and held that the admission of the expert testimony was proper, but that the failure to prescribe the proper drug was testified to be a proximate cause of the patient's injuries by the patient's expert. Therefore, whether or not such was actually a proximate cause was a matter for the jury. The court found that the doctor was not responsible for the patient's psychotic condition and that when the hospital elected to accept the patient with psychiatric disorders, the prime responsibility to afford reasonably safe facilities and reasonable attendance to the patient's needs to prevent self injury was the hospital's and not the doctor's.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's entry of a directed verdict for the doctor and remanded for a newt trial on the issue of whether the failure to prescribe the proper drug was the proximate cause of the patient's injuries.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 8-23-103(d) was unconstitutional, and that he was entitled to back pay. Appellee state officials also sought review of the decree, which overruled their motion to dismiss the action on sovereign immunity grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge, who was first appointed and then elected to serve out the remaining term of his predecessor, asserted that &sect; 8-23-103(d), which became effective during the judicial term he was serving, was unconstitutional. The judges who took office prior to the effective date were allowed an annual adjustment of their base salaries, as set forth in &sect; 8-23-103(c), whereas the application of &sect; 8-23-103(d) placed the limitation on the judge's annual adjustments. The chancery court construed &sect; 8-23-103(d) so as to allow the application of the limitation only to those judges appointed or elected after the effective date and the court reversed. First, the court agreed that the action was not barred by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 20-13-102(a), the sovereign immunity statute, because it was not an action against the State. Next, however, the court rejected the chancery's court construction of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 8-23-103(d) and concluded that, on its face, the second sentence of &sect; 8-23-103(d) violated Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 7. The court reasoned that the chancery court impermissibly rewrote the statute, which amounted to an act of judicial legislation, and held that the judge was entitled to back pay.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the chancery court's judgment and declared unconstitutional the statute limiting judges' salary adjustments and remanded the cause with directions to enter judgment awarding back pay to the judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, residents of a subdivision, sought review of the decision of the Chancery Court for Coffee County (Tennessee), which entered a judgment for defendants, group home operator, Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, and state attorney general, and denied the residents' requests for injunctive and declaratory relief in an action challenging the placement of a group home in an area zoned low density residential.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents lived in a subdivision zoned as low density residential. Pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 13-24-102, the operator located a group home for unrelated handicapped persons within the subdivision. The residents filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment declaring Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 13-24-101 to 13-24-104&nbsp;unconstitutional and also sought injunctive relief. The trial court entered a judgment for defendants. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the challenged statutes did not take or impair the residents' property rights because zoning restrictions did not create vested rights. Further, the challenged statutes were a valid exercise of the state's police power because the statutes were a reasonable exercise of the legislature's power to address the integration of handicapped persons into society. Moreover, the challenged statutes were not violative of the equal protection provisions of Tenn. Const. art. 11, &sect; 8 or U.S. Const. amend. XIV because the handicapped classification had a reasonable basis and did not operate arbitrarily. Finally, the operator was entitled to the protection of the challenged statutes because it was not operating on a commercial basis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision denying the residents injunctive relief and denying the residents' request to have certain statutes declared unconstitutional in the action challenging the placement of a group home in an area zoned low density residential. The cause was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that an insurance policy placed a duty on the county to file a claim timely. The court concluded that the county clerk was unaware of the insurance coverage, but as so as the county clerk became aware of the coverage, she gave written notice to the appropriate county official of her intent to seek attorney's fees and expenses from the county. The county failed, until nearly three years later, to discharge its duty to the county clerk and this delay defeated recovery under the policy provisions. Therefore, the court concluded that under agency principles, the county was liable to the county clerk to the extent of coverage provided in the policy had it discharged its duty as an agent and given timely notice of the claim. The court rejected the county clerk's contention that the legal fees incurred were an expense of the office reimbursable under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 8-22-108, holding that &sect; 8-22-108 the legal fees paid in the county clerk's personal defense did not inure to the benefit of the office of the clerk.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners owned three tracts of land. The deed for two tracts of land contained a reservation of mineral rights; however, the third tract did not contain a reservation of mineral rights. The putative owners alleged that they were the owners of tract three, and both parties were able to trace their ownership to the original owner. On review, the court noted that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 28-2-109 created a prima facie presumption of ownership. The court held that there was no showing that the property owners paid a separate tax on the mineral estate of the tract. The court reasoned that the property owners would have had to obtain title to the mineral estate by adverse possession. In addition, the court stated that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 28-2-110 did not prevent the putative owners from defending their title when they failed to pay taxes for 20 years. The court held that the estate of the putative owners was a freehold in the mineral rights that included the oil and gas. The court concluded that the conveyance of the mineral interest rights created a separate estate; therefore, the property owners had to establish adverse possession of the mineral rights separately from the surface.</SPAN></P>

The State argued that the chancery court lacked jurisdiction under Tenn.

On appeal, the court found that the chancery court erred in finding it had jurisdiction. The court determined that petitioners' right to legal counsel was the same under the Act as under the habeas corpus statutes pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 37-1720.

Furthermore, the requirements of due process were not as compelling in cases such as this as in cases involving the possibility of confinement of the juvenile in a correctional setting.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The division of water control denied the applicant's request for a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit to discharge water into a creek in conjunction with coal mining. The Tennessee Water Quality Control Board (board) affirmed. The lower court affirmed. The applicant appealed. The court affirmed because the standard that the division relied on, the Tennessee Anti-Degradation Statement, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 1200-4-3.06(1), was not unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the board sufficiently commenced a hearing within 60 days from the receipt of the petition, was not required to complete the hearing in 60 days, pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 70-332(a), and properly placed the burden of proof on the applicant. The permit denial was supported by substantial and material evidence, including the results of a survey of the creek waters made after the denial of the permit and expert testimony that further mining in the watershed would pollute and destroy the county's last remaining trout stream, which was protected under the Tennessee Water Quality Control Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 70-324 et seq.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant property owner sought review of the order of the Chancery Court for Montgomery County (Tennessee), which granted the summary judgment motion of plaintiff city that dissolved a temporary injunction enjoining the enforcement of Clarksville, Tenn., Ordinance 6-1967-68 art. VIII, &sect; E (Repl. 1974).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1964, the city annexed the property owner's land. The owner operated an auto salvage business on the property. In 1967, the city passed Ordinance 6-1967-68 art. VIII, &sect; E. Under the ordinance, the salvage business was a nonforming use. The owner had two years to conform to the ordinance for the property's residential district and five years to conform for the property's commercial district. The owner obtained a temporary injunction enjoining enforcement of the ordinance. Thereafter, the chancery court granted the city's summary judgment motion and dissolved the injunction. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the enforcement of the ordinance did not violate Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 13-7-208 because there was no change in the status of the zoning applicable to the owner after passage of &sect; 13-7-208. Further, the use of amortization techniques to force zoning changes upon pre-existing lawful land uses was constitutional if reasonable. However, summary judgment was improperly granted because the chancery court should determine whether the zoning ordinance was facially reasonable, and, if it was, whether it was reasonable as applied to the owner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision granting summary judgment and dissolving the temporary injunction. The cause was remanded to the chancery court to determine whether the zoning ordinance was facially reasonable. If the ordinance was reasonable, the chancery court should determine, after an evidentiary hearing, if the ordinance was reasonable as applied to the property owner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A landowner sought rezoning of a portion of his property to sale produce on a proposed major thoroughfare. The Land Use Control Board of Shelby County recommended the rezoning of the property over the protest of the objectors. The County Commissioners authorized the rezoning. On certiorari, the circuit court held that the zoning change had no substantial relation to the public welfare and was an arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of police power. The trial judge found the rezoning was not in accordance with an approved comprehensive plan and that there was no evidence of the development of land in the area creating a demand for commercial facilities. On appeal, the landowner contended there was evidence before the County Commissioners to support the rezoning or at least make the question fairly debatable. The court determined that the circuit court erred in reversing the County Commissioners' action because whether the rezoning may or may not have conflicted with the plan was simply a judgment call of the legislative body. Because there was proof that commercial use at the site would have been either beneficial or harmful to the general public, the issue was fairly debatable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order and upheld the County Commissioners' rezoning action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State sought review of a judgment of the trial court (Tennessee) in an eminent domain case. It contested the right of appellee owner, a public utility, to recover expenses for relocation of its telephone lines located on poles along a public sidewalk. The State had condemned a strip of land along the street in front of the owner's central office. The portion taken from the front of the owner's property was a strip 30 feet wide.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's telephone cables were carried from its office to the street on overhead trusses suspended between utility poles. When the lines reached the street, some went directly across to poles on the other side and some were attached to poles on the near or west side that ran with the street. A five-foot wide sidewalk ran along the west edge of the street and the utility poles were set in the sidewalk. The jury found that the State owned the sidewalk, but it awarded an amount for removing the utility lines that covered the expenses for removal and reinstallation all along the street. On appeal, the court noted that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-16-114 provided that whenever a person acquired an interest in real property and such acquisition required the removal of fixtures or equipment, the reasonable expenses of the removal were to be considered in assessing incidental damages. However, what required the relocation of the utility poles was the use of property already in the State's possession, with the exception of the lines that crossed the 30-foot strip taken by the State. Under the statute, a landowner was entitled to be compensated for removal of items only on land that was taken.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the amount of the jury's award for the removal and relocation expenses and remanded the cause to the trial court for a determination of the amount due the owner for the removal and relocation of the owner's property located on the land taken. It taxed the costs on appeal to the owner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Tennessee Health Facilities Commission and a hospital, sought review of an order of the Chancery Court, Part II, of Davidson County (Tennessee), which reversed the Commission's decision granting the hospital a certificate of need. The commission contended, in part, that plaintiff, the Georgia-Tennessee Regional Health Commission (the regional agency), had no standing pursuant to the Tennessee Uniform Administrative Procedures Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital's application to add surgical beds was referred to a state agency and to the regional agency. The regional agency was designated and federally funded, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 3300K-300T, to investigate and report to the Commission on health facility applications in the region. The regional agency recommended disapproval. The Commission reconsidered its original disapproval and granted the certificate of need. The regional agency filed suit to overturn that decision. On appeal, the court held that the regional agency was not an aggrieved person within the meaning of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-5-177 because, by statute, it was a subordinate agency to the Commission in the administrative program regarding health facilities in the state. As such, its interests merged into those of the Commission and it had no standing to take a position before the courts contrary to that of its superior. The Commission had not included an apparently optional provision provided in 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 300N-1(b) that would have provided standing. However, to avoid an unnecessary remand, the court also held that the decision granting the certificate of need was not supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Consistent with its holding that the regional agency had no standing, the court reversed the chancery court's decree, but it ordered that if it was later determined that the regional agency had standing to maintain this suit, then the cause would be remanded to the chancery court for further remand to the commission for further findings of fact and re-certification to the chancery court.</SPAN></P>

The mother appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action was previously before the court on the mother's appeal challenging the constitutionality of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-108, which provided for the appointment of a guardian to consent to a child's adoption if the parent was incompetent to give consent. The state supreme court ordered the court to determine whether the statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment appointing the guardian and dismissed the mother's appeal. The court had previously interpreted the statute to vest in a guardian the authority to consent to an adoption only upon an independent determination that the parent was presently so incompetent, and likely to so remain, as to be unable to assume the care and responsibility of a minor child and that such action was in the best interest of the child. The construction of a statute, which restricted a standard to constitutionally permissible bounds, could cure a vagueness problem. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The standard it established was as explicit as possible for carrying out the state's duty to protect minor children without unnecessarily infringing upon the rights of the parent.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the Board was not required to invoke a &quot;clear and convincing&quot; standard of proof to establish gross misconduct.

The citizens alleged that they had been deprived of due process and that they had standing to bring their action for declaratory relief as voters or as taxpayers.

The citizens failed to allege any special interest or injury to themselves as opposed to the public in general, and therefore they lacked standing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant judge sought review of a judgment from a chancery court (Tennessee), which held that the judge's correct salary was $ 9,800 per year as established by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 16-1109(C) rather than &sect; 15,000 per year as established by &sect; 16-1109(D). Because the judge had continued to practice law, the trial court held that the judge's pay was restricted by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 16-1113 (amend. 1978).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After taking office in 1974, the judge continued to practice law. Thereafter, the judge filed a declaratory judgment action, seeking a determination of his salary rights. In holding that the judge's salary was $ 9,800 per year as established by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 16-1109(C) rather than &sect; 15,000 per year as established by &sect; 16-1109(D), the trial court held that the judge's pay was restricted by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 16-1113 (amend. 1978) because he had continued to practice law. Upon review, the court rejected the contention that 1974 Tenn. Pub. Acts 808, which amended Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 16-1109 but which was partly allocated to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 16-1113 (amend. 1978), was unconstitutional on grounds of insufficient caption because the Act's subject matter was not broader than its caption. The court also held that the judge was not deprived of equal protection or due process merely because the pay of judges of counties of a different class was made different by statute. Finally, the court held that the judge could not benefit from &sect; 16-1113's 1978 amendment because Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 7 forbade alterations in a judge's salary during the judge's term.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed with the adoptive parents' contention that a final judgment in a sister state was ordinarily conclusive upon the merits in every other state, but held that it was not obliged to give full faith and credit to any judgment of a state which was violative of Tennessee's public policy or the Federal Constitution. The court found that the natural father did not have notice of the Georgia adoption proceedings and that the child's mother did everything she could to keep the natural father from his child and to deny him an opportunity to be heard in Georgia. The court further found that the natural father had established, through his sperm and through his efforts to find his natural child, such a relationship with the child as to entitle him to due process of laws in any proceeding adverse to his parental rights and that no court could have constitutionally deprived the father of his child without giving him notice. The court concluded that to deny the natural father due process of laws would be repugnant to the Federal Constitution and the public policy of Tennessee, refused to afford full faith and credit to the Georgia decree, and rendered the decree nugatory.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court agreed with the contention of appellees that there was both warrant in the record and a reasonable basis in law to support the Board of Review's interpretation of the disqualification statute denying the employee's claim for benefits within the context of the specific circumstances of the employee's separation from work. The employee's disqualification for benefits was based upon the circumstances of her own creation that surrounded her separation from work that she had already accepted, and it did not force her to abandon one of the precepts of her religion as a pre-condition to eligibility.</SPAN></P>

The amount was subsequently modified several times until the husband filed a petition to terminate the alimony contending that the award was based on an unconstitutional statute because Tenn.

The trial court denied his petition, and the husband appealed asserting that the trial court erred in finding that he was barred from raising a constitutional challenge to the alimony decree. The court affirmed the judgment holding that the doctrine of res judicata was properly applied by the trial court prohibiting the husband from attacking the divorce proceedings because no appeal was taken at the time. The court concluded that it made no difference whether the decree was based upon good or bad law because the husband was not making payments under any statute, constitutional or otherwise, but that he was making his payments by virtue of a the trial court's decree from which no appeal was timely taken.</SPAN></P>

The husband appealed, claiming that the trial court erred in failing to reduce child support payments, to determine whether the husband had a duty to provide educational expenses for his children after they reached the age of majority, and to terminate alimony payments on an additional ground.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband was granted a divorce and the decree, including the incorporated property settlement agreement, provided that the husband would pay to the wife $ 12,000 per year as child support and alimony, with $ 250 per month for each child, and the remainder to be considered alimony. The agreement provided that when the children reached 18 years of age, the wife would continue to receive $ 12,000 as alimony until she remarried, and that the husband would pay for college education through a four-year degree. The trial court discontinued alimony, however, refused to reduce child support or to make a determination on the husband's liability for their college education. The court affirmed, as modified, and remanded for enforcement of the modification. The court held that given the fact that the husband's reported income was less than the annual alimony required and that the wife could find some type of employment, it was proper to reduce the alimony. The court held, however, that he was not entitled to terminate alimony completely and the wife's misconduct in living with another man could not be a consideration, and there was no justification for the reduction of child support.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner was the proprietor of a retail grocery business. The city passed a zoning ordinance restricting certain signs within the city limits. The owner's property was annexed into the city.

The owner filed an action against the city for a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of the ordinance and for an injunction restraining the city from prosecuting him for violations of the ordinance. The city filed a motion to dismiss the action. The chancery court denied the motion. On appeal, the court reversed the chancery court's order and dismissed the owner's action. The court held that an action for a declaratory judgment would not lie where the identical questions presented involving the same parties were before another court in a separate proceeding. The court determined that all of the issues raised by the owner in the chancery court could have been raised as a defense in the city court action.

The taxpayers were taxed under the Business Tax Act, but for certain years were also assessed taxes by the City and the county for personal property taxes pursuant to the Property Tax Act. The taxpayers paid the taxes assessed under the Property Tax Act under protest and later filed their complaint in the chancery court seeking a refund of the taxes paid. On motion for summary judgment, the chancellor held that the taxpayers were entitled to the refund because they could only be taxed under the Business Tax Act. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the taxes levied under the Business Tax Act were a gross receipts tax and taxes assessed under the Property Tax Act were ad valorem taxes or a tax based on the value of the article taxed. The court concluded that the taxpayers could not be taxed under both acts. The court found that Tenn. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district proposed a bond issue to build a new school. Plaintiffs filed suit against defendants in an effort to block the proposed bond issue with resultant taxes against their land. Plaintiffs contended that the district had been deactivated sometime during the 1930's and could not be reactivated under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 49-233 because it did not meet the statute's requirements. The trial court dismissed the suit, holding that the district had not been deactivated. Upon review the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that although the county's board had received state funds on behalf of the district, the district never gave up its control of its school system, and thus the district had not been deactivated. The court found that plaintiffs did not prove an abolition of the district as allowed by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 49-402 or a transfer of the district's school system administration to the county school system as allowed by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 49-403.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was in the business of buying, selling, distributing, transporting, and merchandising wholesale grocery items. The taxpayer asserted that all goods acquired or held by it were for resale only and that the property constituted inventory and was exempt from ad valorem taxation under Tenn.

The taxpayer further claimed that during a random audit in 1978, it was informed by the county assessor's office that it was erroneously paying a tax upon inventory located at a facility. Specifically, it was being taxed on merchandise listed in the 1977 Tangible Personal Property Tax Schedule as inventory, despite the fact such property was exempt. The court held that because the taxpayer was not asserting that it had been grossly, fraudulently, or intentionally overvalued or discriminated against, the administrative remedies pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 67-801-67-801 did not have to be pursued. However, as the taxpayer did not sufficiently allege duress, it was foreclosed from attacking the payment in court without first exhausting its administrative remedies pursuant to Tenn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, certain municipalities and their residents, appealed the judgment of the Chancery Court of Weakley County (Tennessee), which dismissed their action against defendants, tax authorities and certain individuals.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' complaint was based on the fact that municipal residents paid the same tax as other county residents, but the tax revenues were not used to improve the streets in the municipalities. Plaintiffs claimed that 1949 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 640 violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment unless a portion of the revenues were allocated to the municipalities located in the county. The chancery court dismissed the complaint and plaintiffs appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the tax was uniformly applied to all county residents. The county was the basic form of government and all county residents could be taxed for maintenance and improvement of county roads. Residents of municipalities were also county residents and were subject to the same tax. Municipal residents were responsible for maintaining their own streets, but they were also responsible, as county residents, for maintaining county roads. The court could not decree the allocation of tax revenues. The court applied the rational basis test to the equal protection argument and found no constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient appealed an order of the trial court (Tennessee), which granted defendant municipal hospital's motion for partial summary judgment in the patient's medical malpractice action. The hospital had asserted that the amount of its liability was limited by the Tennessee Governmental Tort Liability Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 23-3301 et seq. On appeal, the patient alleged that the Act contravened the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was admitted to the hospital, where she was administered a wrong medication. She brought suit against the hospital, which admitted liability but claimed that as an instrumentality of the city that its liability was limited in amount by the Act. On appeal from a grant of partial summary judgment in favor of the hospital, the patient alleged that the Act contravened the due process and equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 8 and 17. The court held that the operation of a municipal hospital was a traditional governmental function. The Act purported to apply to municipalities in the exercise of their proprietary, as well as their governmental, functions, as set forth in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 23-3307. The court affirmed the order, finding that the provisions of the Act that extended immunity to municipalities operating in their proprietary capacities was a valid legislative enactment. The Legislature could reasonably have found that it was unreasonable to hold a city liable for the torts committed by its agents in the performance of their duties; the court found that such concerns compelled the extension of liability by the Legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company requested a rate increase and presented evidence of probable increases in certain expenses and investments, and attrition. The commission denied the request. On appeal, the court held that the chancellor properly invalidated the commission's order because the order was not supported by substantial evidence. The court determined that the commission ignored the company's uncontroverted evidence that substantial increases were to take place in the company's expenses and investments without the company compensating the increase in revenue. The court ruled that the commission's decision was, therefore, based upon speculation, and not substantial evidence. The court, after reviewing the record, reversed its supersedeas order vacating the chancellor's order, which had authorized the company to temporarily effectuate its proposed rate increases. The court held that because, as a matter of law, a rate increase would have been allowed had the commission properly considered the uncontroverted evidence, it authorized a temporary implementation of rate increases not exceeding ten percent of existing rates.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed that decision. The court found that the circuit and chancery courts had the inherent powers necessary to insure the adequate fulfillment of their judicial functions, that the judges had adequate courtroom facilities, and that under the facts of the case, under either the higher standard of clear, cogent, and convincing proof or merely a preponderance of the evidence, the judges had failed to show such reasonable necessity for the use of the courtroom that would allow them to utilize their inherent powers.

The company's business was in operation prior to the passage of the ordinances and the company came within the protection afforded by &sect; 13-708. It was irrelevant that the company was not the fee owner of the land but only held a leasehold interest because to construe &sect; 13-708 in a manner that excluded lessees from its protection was contrary to legislative intent.

Code Ann. &sect; 63-401 defined chiropractic as the science of palpating, analyzing, and adjusting the articulation of the human spinal column and adjacent tissues by hand. Pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 53-4122, the collection of human specimens could have only been performed by physicians, dentists, or licensed laboratory personnel under the immediate supervision of a physician or a recognized technologist. Under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 63-122 the board had the power to enforce compliance with statutes that related to chiropractic practice..</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Wildlife Resources Agency sought review of a decree by a chancery court (Tennessee) in favor of plaintiff bank. The bank sought to protect its security interest in a vehicle, which the Agency declared to be contraband and ordered sold as property of the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Agency seized a vehicle that was used to transport a female deer in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 51-425. The bank had a perfected security interest in the vehicle on which there was a balance owing. At issue was the constitutionality of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 51-709, which purported to extend to owners and others who had an interest in property seized as contraband under the Fish, Game and Wildlife Resources Statutes the right to assert their interests in seized property. The bank alleged that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 51-709 was unconstitutional in that it failed to provide for a fair and impartial hearing and violated the bank's right to due process of law. The court reversed. Although a very comprehensive and elaborate claim procedure existed, it was meaningless as to innocent claimants of seized property. The only issue that could be determined under &sect; 51-709 was whether property seized was used in such a manner as to be declared contraband under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 51-707. There was no provision permitting an innocent claimant to prevail once seized property had been declared to be contraband. When applied to innocent claimants, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 51-709 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decree of the trial court and ordered entry of a decree ordering the Agency to sell the vehicle at public auction. The proceeds were to be first applied to the payment of the claim of the bank. The balance of the sales price, if any, was the property of the State.</SPAN></P>

The department alleged that the patient suffered from gangrene of both feet that required the removal of her feet to save her life, and that she lacked the capacity to appreciate her condition or to consent to necessary surgery. The chancellor and the trial court found that the patient's life was critically endangered; that she was mentally incapable of comprehending the facts which constituted that danger; and that she was, to that extent, incompetent, thereby justifying state action to preserve her life. On appeal, the patient contended that &sect; 14-2301 was unconstitutional. She challenged the provision of the statute authorizing ex parte preliminary orders without a hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The controversy arose because the Tennessee Legislature provided that county officials could join the TCRS without providing that this might not be done to obtain duplicate benefits, that is, that a county official must relinquish his rights in one system in order to obtain rights in another. After the county officials had paid the necessary amounts to buy into the TCRS, the Legislature undertook to retroactively declare and enforce a public policy against dual public pensions. The trial court found that 1975 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 315, &sect; 1 was constitutional and provided that the county officials were to receive a refund of the money they paid into TCRS. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the two retirement systems through which the county officials must claim membership in the TCRS specifically excluded members of other public retirement systems. The court ruled that 1975 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 315 was merely a reiteration and clarification of pre-existing law relating to the superseded systems which plaintiffs undertook to join in entering the TCRS. The court further found that the county officials had no standing to challenge 1975 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 315, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contracts at issue were made before the enactment of the reimbursement statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was admitted to the hospital with respiratory problems, including a collapsed lung. She was placed on a respirator and later suffered a pulmonary embolism, and although she was revived, she suffered brain damage and was semi-comatose. Her family filed the action for a declaratory judgment that her husband be appointed her guardian with authority to remove her from the respirator. The trial court appointed the husband her conservator. While the appeal was pending, the patient died. On appeal, the court dismissed the appeal as moot, except that it reversed the imposition of costs against the patient's physician. The court found that it could not decide a moot question unless the action involved an issue of public interest. The court determined that the question of the family's right to terminate the use of the respirator affected only the rights of the parties and was not a public issue affecting public rights. The court concluded the appeal was moot. The court found that under Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility filed suit to require the complex to purchase water from it instead of KUB, based on an amendment to Tenn.

The complex, although located outside of the municipality's boundaries and within the utility's certificated area, purchased water from KUB under a 1972 agreement. The Tennessee Public Service Commission issued an order finding the utility had the exclusive franchise to provide service within its certificated area, but, due to a lack of jurisdiction directed the utility to pursue an action in a court of equity for relief. On appeal from a judgment of dismissal, the court rejected the utility's argument that the trial court employed the wrong standard in reviewing the Commission's order, noting that the suit was an independent action and not an action to review or enforce a Commission order. Also, the court held that the amendment operated only prospectively and had no effect on the 1972 amendment. The court held that the trial court did not err in finding that it would have been inequitable to have granted the requested relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff students and defendant, a law school faculty, appealed an order of a chancery court (Tennessee), which enjoined the faculty from holding meetings without complying with Tennessee Open Meetings Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 8-4401, et seq., and held that the Open Meetings Act did not prohibit voting by secret ballot at the meetings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Students instituted an action against the faculty, alleging that the meetings of faculty committees violated the Open Meetings Act. Both the students and the faculty appealed the decision of the chancery court. The court held that the faculty committees existed by virtue of having been created by the law school dean. The committees derived their authority from the dean. Their authority was to make recommendations to the dean. The dean was not a public body; he was an administrative officer. Consequently, the faculty meetings and committee meetings were not subject to the provisions of the Open Meetings Act. It was true that the existence of the university and its board were traceable to an act of the legislature. However, that fact did not mean that when the law school dean asked a given number of faculty members to serve on a committee to assist him in decision making, the committee has its genesis in the legislature. Even with respect to matters pertaining to curricula, the faculty did not exercise any governmental authority, nor did it have the power to make recommendations to a governing body, which would bring it within the provisions of the Open Meetings Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers challenged the decision of the Law and Equity Division of the Court of Gibson County (Tennessee) that declared 1975 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 95 to be constitutional and refused to enjoin the sale of bonds issued by the Bradford Special School District (Tennessee) pursuant to the provisions of the Act in the taxpayers' action seeking a finding that the Act was unconstitutional as an improper delegation of legislative power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers argued that it was error to fail to find the Act to be unconstitutional as an improper delegation of the legislative power to the people, a violation of the provisions of Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 3 and art. XI, &sect; 3, and that the District failed to comply with the notice requirements of the Act. The court affirmed the judgment, opining that the Act was constitutional. The court explained that private acts giving the people a right of adoption or rejection of rights or responsibilities was not an improper or unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. The court noted that the Act provided that notice of an election had to be given at least 20 days prior to the date of election by publication in a newspaper circulated in the school district. Although it was conceded that the official notice was delayed by four or five days, the court concluded that with the wide circulation of news, together with a letter explaining why people should vote against the bond issue, which was delivered to everyone in the district, and a door to door canvass of voters that occurred, the short delay in publishing the official notice was relatively unimportant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sections 64-1404(g), (h), (j) prohibit the dispensing opticians from advertising in Tennessee. The trial court determined that the challenged statute was not violative of any constitutional guarantees. However, the court determined that there is an aspect of professionalism and skill employed by the dispensing opticians, even though there is also an element of mere retail selling of a standardized product. The court found that the State's interest in the quality of service and professionalism of dispensing opticians was protected by other provisions of the regulatory scheme that more directly affected those qualities than did the ban on advertising. By prohibiting advertising by dispensing opticians, Tennessee was seeking to protect its citizens in a manner that was violative of the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dealers filed a suit for declaratory judgment against the county, contending that a recently adopted resolution amending the zoning regulations of the county violated the provisions of both the federal and state constitutions. The amendment established single-unit mobile home districts, prescribed their minimum size, as well as the minimum frontage and area for building sites within the district. The dealers' principal objection was directed to that provision that provided that such districts should not be smaller than five acres. The chancellor found the ordinance constitutionally permissible and entered an order dismissing the complaint, from which the dealers duly perfected their appeal. They argued that the ordinance bore no relation to the health, morals, or safety of the community and because it was adopted purely for esthetic purposes, it could not be sustained. The court held that the zoning ordinance relating to mobile homes did aid in the protection of the health, safety, and general welfare of the people and was a valid exercise of police power. It was therefore constitutional.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court rejected the distributors contention that the distiller was estopped from challenging the constitutionality of Rule 0100-3-.13(7) because it had accepted the benefits of the rule in the past. The court held there was nothing in the record that supported the conclusion that the distiller accepted specific benefits under the regulations, which was an equitable proposition. The court also rejected the distributors contention that the grant of summary judgment was erroneous because all facts material to the resolution were not admitted because no affidavits were filed in opposition of the motion. The court held that in light of the facts before the trial court summary judgment was proper. However, the court held that the trial court erred in holding Rule 0100-3-.13(7), violated the state and federal constitutions, and erred in ruling the Commission and its regulatory predecessors had no statutory basis to promulgate Rule 0100-3-.13(7).</SPAN></P>

The juvenile court found that the juvenile was not amenable to treatment or rehabilitation as a juvenile through available facilities and that he was not mentally retarded or mentally ill and that the interest of the community required that the juvenile be placed under legal restraint or discipline. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the finding. The language of Tenn.

The jury awarded meager damages to both. The trial court granted the southbound driver's motion for new trial. As to the passenger's new trial motion, the trial judge said it was &quot;well taken&quot; but instead of granting it offered an additur to the northbound driver. The amount of the additur and the verdict was still much less than the passenger felt entitled to but the northbound driver took the offer and judgment was entered accordingly. The passenger appealed the judgment but the court affirmed. The court held that forcing an additur on the passenger here did not violate the Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 guarantee of a jury trial. While a forced additur to a jury verdict obtained by misconduct such as passion, prejudice, or caprice would deny a fair trial to the passenger, the court did not find such misconduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widening of the state highway was to provide the landowner with only one entrance to his property. The trial court found that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 54-540 to -542 gave the commissioner the unlimited power to regulate and limits the landowner's access to the road, but that the landowner was entitled to be compensated for the loss of his access rights. The court reversed, finding that the purpose and intent of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 54-540 to -542 was to afford the regulation of construction within the rights-of-way of state highways and not to authorize the regulation or restriction of the rights of access of abutting property owners.  Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 54-540 to -542 did not deprive the landowner of any property right, nor authorize any regulation or action which deprived him of any property right, and thus Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 54-540 to -542 were valid and constitutional and no rights to compensation to the landowner arose by their passage or exist by their existence.The court noted that if the landowner was denied a permit for a driveway in the future, then he could bring an action for compensation in inverse compensation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county judge argued, among other things, that it was error for the trial court to authorize employment of two additional deputies at a particular salary, that it was error to increase the salary of the present deputy, and that it was error to direct the quarterly county court to make the necessary appropriation to pay the maximum salary fixed by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 8-2403 and the expenses of his office, including the salary of his deputies. On appeal, the court held that the trial court had jurisdiction to hear and pass upon the application of the Sheriff for an increase in the salary of the then existing deputy sheriff and the appointment of two additional deputies and to fix their salaries. The court also held that while the county judge was a necessary and proper party in a proceeding of such kind, nevertheless, where it appeared that a mandamus directed to the quarterly county court in its legislative capacity could have been or was required to obtain the relief sought, the members of that court should have been made parties defendant and brought before the trial court prior to the issuance of a mandatory order such as the trial court entered in the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The medical board filed an action against the foreign corporations for violations of the medical board's rules prohibiting advertising.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a county, a judge, a county tax assessor, and a county trustee, appealed the decision of the chancellor (Tennessee), which granted a declaratory judgment to complainants, a university and its lessees, individually and as class representatives of other lessees. The chancellor enjoined defendants from collecting taxes on the university's exempt property. Intervenor Equalization Board of the State of Tennessee was also a party defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The university changed the boundaries of its original reserve of 1,000 acres, which was created via its charter of incorporation, when it was apparent that the county was going to assess the leasehold estates of the university's lessees. The university contended that the property found within the boundaries of the reserve were tax-exempt for both the fee simple and the leaseholds. The court agreed insofar as the original reserve was concerned, but otherwise reversed the chancellor's judgment. The court found that an exemption from taxation, granted to the university in its charter prior to the Tennessee Constitution of 1870 and then accepted and acted upon by the university, was a contract binding upon the State, which could not be impaired by subsequent legislative acts or constitutional provisions. Thus, the property within the original reserve, which could not be changed by the university, was exempt as to both the fee simple and leasehold estates. However, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-502(8) was unconstitutional to the extent that it purported to grant tax-exempt status to a leasehold estate that was not being used for an educational purpose and was not part of the original reserve.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and set aside the chancellor's judgment in its entirety except as it pertained to the original reserve by the university, which was affirmed. The case was remanded for enforcement of the decree and for other proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The annexation ordinances were validly passed and the residents filed a quo warranto proceeding challenging the city's ordinances of annexation. The parties in the quo warranto proceeding dismissed the suit by agreement. In the meantime, the Legislature passed an act applicable to the city which provided for a &quot;variable tax plan&quot; under which the taxpayers of the annexed areas would be taxed only to the extent of the contemplated services actually being rendered by the city. If the ordinance was declared unconstitutional, then the residents were not liable for taxes that had accrued before that adjudication. The quo warranto proceeding was dismissed with prejudice. The ordinance was declared unconstitutional and the residents filed this proceeding to get a refund of the taxes that they had paid to the city. The trial court denied the refunds. On review, the court held that the municipality could not &quot;de-annex&quot; the territory after the lapse of 30 days, so the annexed territories were part of the City of Chattanooga and the residents of the annexed territories had to pay the same taxes as the people living within the original boundaries.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the manufacturer's express warranty had expired at the time of the accident.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorneys sought review of a judgment by the Chancery Court of Johnson City (Tennessee), which dismissed the attorneys' petitions for a decree of reinstatement. Appellee bar associations had previously permanently disbarred the attorneys and forever enjoined and prohibited them from engaging in the profession of lawyers or in the practice of the law in any form or manner whatsoever, directly or indirectly, in the State of Tennessee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chancellor denied relief to one attorney on the grounds that the attorney failed the residency requirements because the proof showed that he was, at the time of the hearing, and had been a citizen and resident of New York State since late 1939. As to the other attorney, the chancellor denied relief on the basis that he had failed to carry the burden of proof of showing that he was a proper person to be entitled to the privilege of practicing law. The attorneys filed the petitions based upon amended Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-310, claiming that they were entitled to reinstatement. Under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 29-308, 29-310, in force when the attorneys were disbarred, such reinstatement was not permitted. The bar associations argued that the amended Code section was an encroachment by the legislative department upon the function of the judicial department of government. The court agreed with the bar associations, holding that &sect; 29-310 constituted an attempted exercise by the legislative branch of government of those powers properly belonging to the judicial branch of government. It was violative of Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 2, and art. VI, &sect; 1, and therefore void.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and found that because the apartment dweller had invited the injured party to assist him in the erection of the antenna, insofar as the work to be performed was concerned, the apartment dweller owed to the injured party the duty to exercise ordinary and reasonable care in the performance of the task at hand. Thus the apartment dweller owed no duty to maintain the utility poles, but was under the duty to afford the injured party, as a work invitee, ordinary care and prudence under the circumstances. Any prejudice to the injured party regarding an instruction relating to a local ordinance was not evident to the court. The court also found no proof of gross negligence in this case and was of the opinion that the trial court was correct in withdrawing that issue from the jury.</SPAN></P>

The common law writ of certiorari did not bring up for determination any question except the question whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction or acted illegally, arbitrarily, or fraudulently.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county tax assessor assessed property taxes against the property owner. The property owner appealed to the County Board of Equalization, which sustained the assessment. The taxpayer then appealed to the State Board, which certified a significant reduction of the subject assessment. The county appealed and the appellate court invalidated the reduction and found that it was not determined by a lawful quorum. The taxpayer appealed, claiming that the county was not a party before the State Board and thus had no right to complain. On appeal, the courtruled that a taxpayer was entitled to a hearing by a quorum of the State Board whenever another taxpayer was relieved of a tax burden and the county, as the representative of all taxpayers, was entitled to the same right. That right was denied by the State Board's determination. Thus, the court affirmed the invalidation of the State Board's decision on the grounds of a lack of quorum. However, the court remanded the matter to the State Board for a proper assessment of taxes, after a proper investigation and consideration of the evidence, determined by a quorum of the State Board.</SPAN></P>

Defendants filed a demurrer, which was sustained by the trial court. On appeal, defendants argued that the trial court should have found the Act to be in violation of the state constitution and Metro. Gov't Nashville &amp; Davidson County, Tenn., Code Laws ch. 19.01. The judges argued that the trial court erred in holding that the pay increases in the Act did not apply to the judges' courts. The court held that the Act was not unconstitutional because it could be interpreted in a way that would not put it in conflict with any of the constitutional provisions cited by defendants. However, that interpretation resulted in the conclusion that the Act did not apply to the judges' courts or entitled them to a pay increase. The court rejected the judges' contention that they were entitled to a raise because their duties had been increased. The judges' pay could not legally be decreased in accordance with their duties, either. The Act applied only to the Court of General Sessions, which did not include the judges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a testator's son, challenged a decree of the Chancery Court of Putnam County (Tennessee), which ordered a sale of land for the purpose of partition. Defendant, a second son, did not make an appearance. Complainants, the testator's grandchildren, contended that it would have been to the parties' advantage that the land be sold. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the grandchildren, which led to the chancellor's decree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the son argued that the property should have been partitioned and not sold as a whole. The court found that the factual data regarding the land supported the opinions of the witnesses for the grandchildren and the jury that it was manifestly to the advantage of the parties that the land should be sold and the proceeds divided instead of partitioned in kind. The land had once been used for a dairy and could again be used for the same purpose. The son also argued that the trial court erred in finding that his plea in abatement failed to present any issues of fact. The non-appearing second son did not sign the agreement under which the plea in abatement was filed. The court held that where an instrument had been executed by only a portion of the parties between whom it was purported to be made, it was not binding on those who had executed it. The son argued that the decree did not fix a minimum sale price for the land. The court held that there was no showing that a fixed sale price was to the benefit of the parties. Therefore, it had to be sold for the best price it could bring, whatever that price was. There were no statutory requirements for a minimum price.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the jury's verdict and modified the chancellor's decree so that the new order of sale directed that the property be offered in two parcels for separate sale, and also offered for sale as a whole. As modified the chancellor's judgment was affirmed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the court ruled that the Department was in privity with the mother, who had initiated the original proceedings against the alleged father. The proceedings initiated by the Department were not started until more than one year after the dismissal of the mother's cause.

The trial court awarded all of the property to the wife in a divorce action. The court affirmed, holding first that the trial court had jurisdiction and rejecting the husband's contention that 1949 Tenn. Acts ch. 54, which conferred jurisdiction, violated Tenn. Const. art. 2, &sect;17 because the omission of certain amendatory acts invalidated the Act under consideration. The Act, which amended the original General Sessions Court Act of Warren County, was broad enough to effect any incidental changes to the original Act. As for the award of the property to the wife, the award was within the discretion of the trial court and was not abused. Circumstances of acquisition, maintenance, and improvement created equities between the parties, which the trial court was authorized to adjust. The parties had obtained the real property from the wife's father through gift or purchase at a generous price. The wife assisted in or completely performed all improvements and maintained the property after the husband's desertion, so she acquired a substantial equitable interest in it overt the bare joint title.</SPAN></P>

The collateral heirs contended, and the Chancellor held, that the language &quot;born to them in lawful wedlock&quot; in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-126 granted to the collateral relatives of the adoptive parents the right of inheritance. After reviewing the language in the rest of the statute and its history, the court disagreed and held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-126 failed to provide expressly or by implication that collateral heirs of an adoptive parent could inherit from an adopted child. Since adoption statutes had to be strictly construed as in derogation of common law, the State took by escheat.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a judgment for plaintiff for hospitalization expenses not paid by another insurance policy, and defendant appealed. The court on review held that the policy term &quot;incur&quot; meant to become liable for and not, as defendant contended, to pay for. The court held that defendant was liable for charges resulting from plaintiff's hospitalization although the expenses were not actually paid by plaintiff. According to the court, the record showed that plaintiff was a paying patient. The court rejected defendant's claim of unconstitutional discrimination by the hospital in its system of charges where all patients were charged the same rates. The court held that defendant's refusal to pay benefits was contrary to Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife challenged only that part of the decree divesting her title to the land. The wife argued that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-825 was unconstitutional as authorizing a taking of property in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court held that since &sect; 36-825 was enacted after title to the property became vested, it could not be applied in a manner to effect a complete divestiture of title upon a dissolution of the marriage solely because of the wife's fault. However, the court enjoined the wife from disposing of her interest in the tenancy by the entirety because the husband had made substantial improvements to the property and the wife had squandered her earnings. The court based its holding on the considerable equitable interest of the husband and disregarded the legal title. The court noted that the amendment empowered the court, upon dissolution of the marriage, to settle property rights upon equitable principles and did not violate either of the constitutional provisions here invoked. The court held that the amendment should be broadly construed and liberally applied to accomplish its objective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife claimed that the enforcement officers falsely arrested her and subjected her to malicious prosecution. The enforcement officers argued that the wife had engaged in transporting minnows that were bought from an unapproved hatchery, and had transported minnows into the state without a transportation permit. The husband claimed that he was damaged by the death of the minnows involved. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 51-214 and 51-436 was designed to prevent the delivery of minnows within the state from an unapproved hatchery and to prevent the delivery of minnows by persons without the proper license and permit. The court determined that the enforcement officers were vexed that they lost the wife in traffic. Under those circumstances, the enforcement officers charged the wife with two offenses. The court concluded that the enforcement officers did not arrest and swear out warrants against the wife in good faith. The court found that the husband could have prevented the death of the minnows simply by driving the minnow truck to the courthouse where the wife was to post cash bond and then be released.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurance company sought review of a judgment by a trial court (Tennessee), which was entered in favor of appellee, a company that was the beneficiary under several life insurance policies. The trial court granted a recovery to the beneficiary for the face value of the policies. The case involved the validity of the purported conversion of life insurance from ordinary life to paid-up participating insurance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company filed the bill for a declaratory judgment adjudicating the extent of its liability upon the three life insurance policies. When the policies were issued and at the date of the insured's death, he was the president and managing head of the beneficiary. For many years, the beneficiary had paid the premiums on all of the policies. The company later amended each of the policies to provide that in event of default in the payment of premiums the cash surrender value should be used to purchase paid-up participating insurance. No further premium payments were made, and the policies were thereafter converted by appellant to paid-up participating insurance. This resulted in a reduction of the insurance from $ 100,000.00 to $ 59,767.00, for which the company conceded liability. The validity of the applications made to amend the policies to provide for the purchase of paid-up participating insurance, rather than extended term insurance as set forth in the applications, depended in part at least upon the constitutional validity of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 48-706. The court agreed with the company that the trial judge erred in holding &sect; 48-706 unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and a decree was entered adjudging the company not liable for any amount above that already paid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board filed an action which sought a declaration that the bookkeeping company was engaged in public accountancy and an injunction restraining such practice. The trial court held that the bookkeeping company was not engaged in public accountancy, but enjoined the company from advertising that it maintained a staff of tax experts. The trial court also denied the board's motion for a new trial. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that only those persons who held themselves out to the public as skilled in the knowledge, science, and practice of accounting and as qualified and ready to render professional accounting services, represented themselves to be either a public accountant or a certified public accountant, and performed the work of an accountant for more than one employer were practicing public accounting and had to be licensed.

Plaintiff's leg was seriously injured when his clothing became entangled in a sprocket. On defendants' appeal, the court overruled all of defendants' assignments of error. Merely permitting plaintiff to work violated the Tennessee child labor laws, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 50-711 to -712, even though plaintiff was never formally employed. Defendants' contention that &sect;&sect; 50-711 to -712 were unconstitutional was without merit. Plaintiff's questions on voir dire regarding connections with liability insurance companies may have suggested that defendants had such insurance, but the questions fell far short of constituting evidence to that effect. Counsel asked questions to determine whether or not to strike jurors based on the answers given. Such questions so asked were proper because someone who was connected to an insurance company was likely to look more favorably on the side of defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dealt with the issue of whether or not the real estate was exempt from taxation by the City. The city argued that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-502 was unconstitutional and void under Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The chancellor's decree held that the subject property was exempt from taxation and that the assessments made by the City were void and of no effect. The court found that a brief history of the institute and of the acceptance thereof by the State, under the wills of donors, pointed out that the City was attempting to assess so much of the property as was held by way of investment and not physically used in the work of the institute but the income of which was devoted to the exclusive use of the school's work.</SPAN></P>

The county and the town had no representation on the power board. The act provided the county and the town with representation on the power board. The City alleged that the act was a deviation from the general act in the residence requirements and the number of members comprising the power board and that the act constituted vicious, unreasonable, and arbitrary class legislation in contravention of Tenn.

The company's trucks used in transporting property in interstate commerce constituted its only other property in Tennessee. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court stated that because the tax was an ad valorem tax measured by the value of property, and was not a privilege tax on the company's right to conduct an interstate business, it was not proscribed by the commerce clause and did not violate the due process clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions. Further, the company received the benefit of Tennessee's laws, its roads, and its other facilities thus enabling it to carry on its business in Tennessee.

On appeal, the court modified the injunction to allow time for the operator to conform his property to the prevailing health standards. The court found that the great weight of the evidence sustained the finding of the chancellor that the storage of junk on the operator's lot, in addition to having become an eyesore, caused mosquitoes and rats in large numbers to congregate, breed, and cross the street and converge around the neighbors' homes. The court noted that the operator admitted that he was not in compliance with an ordinance. However, the court also noted that the storage of junk was not illegal and did not per se amount to a nuisance.

The court affirmed and declared the statute constitutional because it did not purport to give the power to tax property which had no situs in Tennessee, as it taxed property that was regularly within the state but at irregular intervals.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff aunt appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Shelby County, Division Three (Tennessee) in favor of defendant assistants in the aunt's action for personal injuries caused by an assault upon her. The case arose out of a custody proceeding between defendant mother and her husband, the aunt's brother. No special defenses were pleaded under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 20-921 and the case was non-suited as to defendant mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The assistants averred that at the time of the incident, they were lawfully helping the mother obtain her child. The mother had taken the child from the aunt's home and the assistants were in the process of driving away when the aunt threw herself on the moving vehicle in an attempt to prevent them from leaving the scene. According to the assistants, any injuries received by the aunt were the direct and proximate result of her unlawful and negligent conduct. On appeal, the aunt argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred when it submitted to the jury a defense of assault and battery on the part of the aunt as a justification for the wrongful acts of the assistants. According to the aunt, the charge was error because the assistants failed to plead any special defenses as required by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 20-921. The court found that the assistants' plea charged no assault other than a possible assault on their automobile. In fact, they specifically averred that there was no assault and battery on either of them by the aunt. Admission of evidence pertaining to the divorce proceeding between the child's parents was similarly erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court set aside the judgment in favor of the assistants and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents lived in the neighborhood where the salvage company operated its business and maintained wrecked automobiles on its property. The residents filed suit to enjoin the salvage company from storing and removing parts from wrecked automobiles by using wrenches, hammers, and torches, and from engaging in the burning of tires, grease, and oil, which caused noxious odors and smoke. The trial court determined that the salvage company's operation was a nuisance and issued an injunction prohibiting further operation of the salvage company's business. The salvage company appealed and the court modified the injunction, holding that the evidence did support the trial court's finding that the salvage company's operation created a nuisance but that it was not justified in enjoining the complete operation of the business. The court modified the injunction to prohibit only the offensive activities and remanded to the trial court for enforcement.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was probable cause, as a matter of law, which could have led the tortfeasor and the police to believe that the victim was guilty of the crime for which he was later indicted. The court determined that the burden was on the victim to prove want of probable cause and he had failed to do so. The court found no element of malice in the case. The court determined that the tortfeasor merely wanted to stop the victim and others from taking parts from his junk yard and he had a right legally and morally to do so.

In a subsequent suit, the ordinance was found to be unconstitutional. Thereafter, the cab company demanded a refund of the street taxes that it had already paid. When the city refused, the cab company filed suit to recover the street taxes. The city argued that the tax payments were voluntary and that the cab company had adequate remedies at law. The trial court entered judgment for the cab company. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the cab company was not entitled to recover the street taxes that were illegally collected because the street taxes were not paid under protest but were paid voluntarily. The evidence showed that the cab company paid the street tax for 11 years without protest under the mistake of law that the tax was valid. Thus, the court held that the street taxes were paid voluntarily and not under duress and the trial court erred in awarding the cab company a recovery of the street taxes.</SPAN></P>

He also argued that his injuries were covered by the municipality's liability coverage. The trial court struck the worker's amendment and granted the municipality's motion for a directed verdict. The worker sought review. The court affirmed. It found that a municipal port project was not significantly different from a municipal airport, which was a governmental and not a private, proprietary function. Furthermore, the legislature had specially declared that the port project was a governmental function. Because the power to grant or deny a remedy under private action was within the legislature's control and because the port by its nature was a governmental function, immunity barred the worker's action. Furthermore, while a municipal insurer could be liable even if the city was immune, the worker failed to allege that the municipality carried liability insurance.</SPAN></P>

The decree granted an injunction to prohibit appellants from maintaining picket lines and engaging in picketing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants engaged in picketing and a strike in an effort to force the county municipal electric system to engage in collective bargaining. They were enjoined from engaging in any picketing of any facility of the system and from intimidating, harassing, or molesting the system's agents, servants, and employees. The system was organized under the Municipal Electric Plant Law of 1935, codified at Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 6-1501 through 6-1537. On appeal, there were two questions of law, one of the constitutionality of the enabling law and whether appellees could lawfully maintain the suit, and one of whether the system could lawfully enter into a collective bargaining agreement. The court upheld the constitutionality of the law. It noted that the commissioners were either de jure or de facto county officers with authority to bring the suit, but even if they were not officers, the county superintendent was an officer and was a named complainant with authority to bring a suit. The system, even acting in a non-governmental capacity was not authorized to enter into a labor contract. The injunction was proper because even peaceful picketing for an unlawful purpose could be enjoined.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decree and remanded the cause to the chancery court for enforcement and supervision of the decree.</SPAN></P>
