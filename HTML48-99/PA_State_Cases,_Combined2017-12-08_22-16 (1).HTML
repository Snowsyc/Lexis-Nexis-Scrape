</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, on two occasions, was the contact person spoken to when a state trooper attempted to obtain sexual services for money. Appellant, in a consolidated trial, was convicted of four counts of promoting prostitution, and single counts of resisting arrest and criminal conspiracy. On appeal, the court affirmed appellant's convictions. The court held that 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5902 did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 because the statute was neutral in its classification and the method of punishing the prostitute and the promoter as the providers, to a greater extent than the client who purchased such services was rationally related to the legitimate purpose of eliminating prostitution. The court held that the activity by the state trooper did not violate appellant's rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV because appellant did not display a reasonable expectation that he would have retained as private the information obtained by police. The court held that consolidation was proper because evidence of one crime would have been admissible in a separate trial for the other.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A municipal court judge acquitted appellant of involuntary manslaughter but convicted him of recklessly endangering another person (REAP) and homicide by vehicle following a two-car accident in which appellant's passenger died. Appellant filed notice of appeal for trial de novo in the court of common pleas and then, based on double jeopardy, filed a motion to quash the information that charged him with REAP and homicide by vehicle, which was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that double jeopardy did not bar trial de novo because crime of which appellant was acquitted required higher level mens rea or scienter, i.e., recklessness, which did not mean that the lower level mens rea of culpable negligence required to establish homicide by vehicle could not be established or that it was foreclosed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A criminal complaint alleged that appellant father had not paid support for more than two years. Appellant denied paternity of the child and alleged the complaint was barred by the statute of limitations. The complaint was amended and alleged that appellant's last contribution was made within the limitations period. Appellant was convicted of having neglected to support his minor child. The court reversed and held that evidence of a single contribution was sufficient to show contribution to support, but the evidence was required show that it was made in circumstances that inferred that the father recognized the child as his own. Proof of either would have extended the period of limitations. If the evidence of the circumstances that surrounded a voluntary contribution were insufficient to have found that the contribution amounted to an acknowledgment of paternity, it would not have extended the period of limitations. There was no basis for an inference that appellant's purchase of lunch less than two years prior was either regarded by the mother or was intended by appellant as a renewal of contribution or an acknowledgement of paternity.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that &sect; 5902 was unconstitutional, the evidence was insufficient, and that the lower court erred in not finding entrapment under 18 Pa. Cons.

</DIV>

Appellant took the money for the massage and after the massage the officer asked it there was anything else to the massage. Appellant quoted the officer prices for intercourse and the officer paid appellant. Appellant removed her clothes in preparation for the sex act. After appellant received the money and put it into her purse the officer placed her under arrest. Appellant was tried and convicted of criminal solicitation under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 902, and prostitution under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5902(a)(1). On appeal, the court affirmed and held that appellant failed to raise any specific constitutional challenge to the statute at trial and therefore waived the constitutional arguments. The court further held that the sex act did not have to occur for the evidence to be sufficient to prove that appellant was engaged in sexual activity as a business. The court further held there was no entrapment under 18 Pa Cons. Stat. &sect; 313, because the officer's behavior was not such as would have induced an innocent person to act as a prostitute.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the evidence was sufficient to prove that appellant placed the advertisement and that the advertisement clearly referred to his opponent.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted on charges of statutory rape, indecent assault, indecent exposure and corruption of minors. Defendant argued that he was denied procedural due process when the trial court erred in denying the admission of testimony as to the minor victim's past sexual conduct with a third person. Defendant had allegedly reported such conduct to the victim's mother and maintained that the evidence was relevant and admissible for the limited purpose of showing that the victim's bias caused her to fabricate the charges against him. The court held that in enacting the rape shield law, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3104, the legislature intended that evidence of a victim's past sexual conduct with third persons was not admissible for any purpose. The court held that the trial court did not err in disallowing the testimony. The court questioned the constitutionality of the statute, noting problems it created in the face of the accused's right to confrontation, but added that the constitutionality of the law was not raised and it could not raise the issue sua sponte. The court affirmed the judgment of sentence, but recognized the constitutional difficulties that the law presented.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's car crossed the median and crashed into two cars.

A second complaint was filed alleging the same facts and charging defendant with driving under the influence as well as homicide by vehicle under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3732 (1977). At the second preliminary hearing the trial judge ruled that the blood test was inadmissible and dismissed the driving under the influence charge. Defendant filed a motion to quash the preliminary hearing transcript, on the basis that she could not be held on the remaining charge as the commonwealth had failed to prove she otherwise violated a provision of the motor vehicle code. The motion was granted, and the commonwealth appealed. The court reversed the order and held that the commonwealth did not need to bring a separate charge for the violation of a motor code provision that resulted in death in a homicide by vehicle charge. The court held that defendant was on notice of the traffic law she violated, driving in the wrong lane, which caused death because the underlying accident was referenced in the charge.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 1921(b), when the words of a statute were clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of the statute was not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.</SPAN></P>

Appellant also contended that the trial court erred in barring spectators from the courtroom when the victim testified, and in surrounding him with guards during the trial. A jury convicted appellant of incest and statutory rape of his 12-year-old daughter. The victim was 14 years old at the time of the trial. She testified that appellant had raped her. Appellant argued that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence because his own testimony contradicted the victim's account, and that her testimony was unreliable because she was only 12 at the time and waited 5 days to report the rape. The appellate court held that the victim's slight delay in reporting the incident only raised issues of credibility for the jurors to resolve. The appellate court, however, vacated the conviction because the record failed to reveal whether the lower court actually ordered the removal of spectators, and whether appellant objected to any such orders. The appellate court therefore remanded for a hearing to supplement the record on that issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted appellant of murder of the second degree, aggravated robbery, and conspiracy. The court affirmed those convictions on appeal, and concluded that the record included sufficient evidentiary findings to sustain appellant's conviction for murder. The court also found that the retrial of appellant on the murder charge after he was convicted of robbery was rational. Although appellant's murder sentence had to be concurrent with, and could not exceed, his robbery sentence, a second sentence could have influenced decisions as to whether he served his maximum sentence. The court further held that reducing the voir dire peremptory challenges between appellant's trials was not an invalid ex post facto application of the law because it did not make a previously noncriminal act an offense, aggravate a crime, increase an offense's penalty, or alter the evidence rules. The court also found that the reference to appellant's gang membership was appropriate because it did not establish that he committed criminal acts, the jury was told to not use it as evidence of guilt, and it was probative of the credibility of the prosecution's chief witnesses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was charged with homicide by vehicle, Motor Vehicle Code, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3732 (1977). The trial court sustained appellee's demurrer. Appellant commonwealth sought review. The court held that &sect; 3732 fixed accountability only for negligent vehicle or traffic violations, but did not impose strict criminal responsibility. Accordingly, the order that sustained appellee's demurrer was affirmed because the evidence was not sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellee's conduct amounted to a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would have observed in her situation. Appellee also sought review of her pre-trial petitions that sought a declaration of the unconstitutionality of &sect; 3732. The court held that appellee's unexcused failure to raise alternative constitutional theories in her original petition was a waiver of the alternative theories. The court addressed appellee's original constitutional challenge, that where a summary offense is an essential element of the charged indictable offense, an accused is absolutely entitled to a finding of guilty or not guilty on the summary offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order that sustained appellee's demurrer to the charge of homicide by vehicle was affirmed because the offense governed deaths that resulted from negligent violations of the rules of the road, and the evidence was not sufficient to go to the jury. Appellee's contention that the statute that established the offense was unconstitutional was without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Obscenity Statute, appellee district attorney filed a complaint in equity against appellants. Appellants were a corporation that operated an adult book store, an alleged officer of the corporation, the store's manager, and the assistant manager. By special findings, a jury determined that each of 15 magazines and five films admitted into evidence by appellee were obscene. The trial court filed a decree that enjoined appellants and their agents, servants, and employees from selling or advertising the magazines and films or any of like or similar kind. Appellants sought review. The court held that the injunction was a prior restraint because it endeavored to impose a final restraint upon publications and films not yet determined to be obscene in a judicial proceeding. Accordingly, it violated the United States Constitution and the Pennsylvania Constitution, and the court struck the language about items of like or similar kind. Also struck was the language that purported to enjoin persons or entities not named in the complaint. That language was surplusage and was at odds with the plain language of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.

Defendant also argued that the state committed reversible error in summation by stating a personal opinion as to witness credibility and that a statement he made to police should have been suppressed as the product of an illegal arrest. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the jury could have found defendant guilty of first-degree murder, so it was acceptable to have treated the case as a potential capital murder case. The court also found that the state's remarks in summation were not error because they were meant to urge the jury to make a fair inference from the facts, and even if they were improper, they were harmless where defendant admitted the shooting but based his defense on other grounds. The court found the statements made to police were not the product of an illegal arrest because the police had probable cause to arrest defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the decision of the lower court that sentenced appellant under the minimum sentencing procedure of the Sentencing Code because the legislature's grant of authority to the courts to establish a minimum sentence was not arbitrary and capricious. Moreover, both the ABA Project and Model Penal Code recommended the use of minimum sentences. The court reasoned that because the United States Supreme Court preferred minimum sentences to no-minimum sentences, that minimum sentences could not be unconstitutional. Finally, the court determined that appellant's claim that quasi-judicial officers, such as parole and probation professionals, were better trained to measure the rehabilitative needs of individual prisoners was better addressed to the legislature than to the courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, along with her husband and son, entered a home without permission, removed furniture, and moved with it to another state. Subsequently, a police officer conducted two warrant searches of defendant's home and seized several items of furniture. Defendant was convicted of receiving stolen property, pursuant to 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3925 (1973). On review of the judgment of sentence, the court affirmed. The court found that the prohibition in &sect; 3925 against retaining and disposing of stolen property made the offense ongoing and therefore, the trial court was not denied jurisdiction. The court found the searches were constitutional because the first item seized was very similar to that described in the warrant and the second item was within the officer's plain view. The court found that the judge's mention of the state's theory of the case in opening comments did not prejudice the defendant.

Appellant contended that respondent did not commit a &quot;wrongful act&quot; and did not sustain a &quot;loss.&quot; The court held that the language of the insurance policy was written in broad terms and appellant was liable.

Appellant argued that &sect; 5301 was unconstitutionally vague because the informations charged him with &quot;mistreatment,&quot; and, since &quot;mistreatment&quot; was not defined in the code, he was not given fair notice that his conduct was forbidden. He also claimed the evidence was insufficient to support the criminal conspiracy convictions. The court found that appellant struck and kicked three inmates without justification or excuse during disciplinary hearings conducted by him in his official capacity. Appellant should reasonably have understood that his conduct was proscribed by the statutory prohibition of &quot;mistreatment.&quot; The jury made the reasoned deduction from that evidence that appellant and the guards had an agreement or understanding among themselves to use physical violence against the prisoners during the hearings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was initially charged with 54 counts of writing illegal prescriptions. At the time of trial, the prosecution chose to try appellant on only four counts. He was convicted of all four counts. On appeal, he argued that the undercover officer was wrongfully allowed to testify as to all of the prescriptions he obtained. The court held that while generally the commonwealth could not introduce evidence of other criminal activity, this was an exception to the general rule of inadmissibility. The evidence was admissible to show a common scheme or plan and it was necessary to show appellant's state of mind and good faith in writing the prescriptions. The court found the statute which proscribed writing illegal prescriptions was not vague and was easily understood. It also ruled that the absence of a particular voir dire question did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Nor did counsel's failure to pursue an entrapment defense cause ineffective assistance; any error was rectified by the entrapment instruction. The court found that appellant was a licensed physician at the time the prescriptions were written and the decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2706, defendant was guilty if he threatened to commit any crime of violence with the intent to terrorize. In looking at the legislative history, the court concluded that the purpose of &sect; 2706 was to punish those who had the intent to terrorize another person and not those who only made threats in anger.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and co-defendant were convicted of gambling. Both were fined, but defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment, while co-defendant received probation. Defendant sought review. The court vacated sentence and remanded for a new sentencing hearing, at which the trial court was to place on the record its reasons for imposing different sentences for defendants. On remand the trial court imposed the same sentence, based on the facts that co-defendant had a serious heart condition and defendant lied in her testimony. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court judgment holding that co-defendant's health was a valid consideration in imposing sentence. The court found that the trial court's consideration of the false testimony was justified where defendant's misstatements were willful and material, and the verdict necessarily established that she lied and was supported by substantial credible evidence. The court held that the trial court observed defendant's testimony and considered her false testimony only in light of other information relevant to its determination of a proper sentence. Defendant's sentence was thus not so harsh as to amount to an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The wife then gave birth to a premature infant, who was stricken with the disease. Appellants sued for wrongful birth and brought suit on behalf of appellant infant for wrongful life. The trial court dismissed appellants' suit. The court affirmed the dismissal of the wrongful life claim. The court held the infant had no fundamental right to be born as a whole, functioning human being. The court held damages would be impossible to calculate, as the worth of never being born could not be ascertained. However, the court reversed the dismissal of the wrongful birth claim. The court held that there were viable claims of negligence and misrepresentations on the part of both doctors.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), which convicted and sentenced him for driving under the influence of alcohol, under 75 P.S. &sect; 3731(a)(1), in a nonjury trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction and sentence for driving under the influence of alcohol, under 75 P.S. &sect; 3731(a)(1). Appellant claimed that he was denied equal protection of the laws by being refused for consideration in the Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (ARD) program, that results from the breathalyzer machine were erroneously admitted, and that it was error to admit testimony regarding his intoxication. The court affirmed appellant's conviction, holding that appellant had no right to demand acceptance into ARD because under Pa. R. Crim. P. 175-185, whether a criminal defendant would be considered for ARD was wholly at the prosecution's discretion. The court found that it was error to admit the results from the breathalyzer machine because the health department had not yet certified the machine, but the error was harmless in light of the evidence of appellant's intoxication. The court held that the testimony of the officers as to appellant's observed state of intoxication was proper because intoxication was not a condition outside the realm of understanding or powers of observation of ordinary persons.</SPAN></P>

The court held that whether appellant was accepted into the Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition program was wholly within the state's discretion. The court found that admission of uncertified breathalyzer machine results was harmless and that police testimony regarding appellant's state of intoxication was admissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the decision of the Court of Common Pleas, Montgomery County (Pennsylvania), which convicted defendant of murder in the first degree after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court reversed the result of defendant's first trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The outcome of defendant's first trial was reversed. Defendant challenged his conviction of murder in the first degree in a second trial. The court affirmed the conviction. The court first determined that evidence defendant sought to have admitted was properly excluded by the trial court because it did not bear on the elements of the M'Naughten test regarding defendant's claim of insanity or related to issues which were for the court to decide rather than the jury. The court also determined that the trial court had properly excluded or modified jury charges requested by defendant so that the charges accurately reflected the M'Naughten test. The court concluded that the trial court had no authority to consider the suppression of evidence that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had determined, as part of the appeal from defendant's first trial, was admissible. The court found no abuse of discretion in the refusal of defendant's request for a change in venue after the trial court had taken reasonable steps to avoid any impact from pretrial publicity. Finally, the court noted that defendant had failed to properly preserve an issue related to alleged prosecutorial misconduct for review.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 4323(a), for failing to support a bastard child. The court affirmed.

Instead, the court found that the statute applied to either parent and was not, therefore, violative of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 28. The court determined that the trial court did not err when it declined to declare a mistrial because of comments made by the Commonwealth during closing argument and made by the complainant during trial. In particular, the court found that defendant failed to lodge a timely objection to the Commonwealth's comments and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to declare a mistrial as the result of the complainant's comments during her testimony.

The court reversed, and state's petitioned for reconsideration was granted. The court modified its decision, as defendant was required to come forward with some evidence of authorization to possess a controlled substance before state needed to disprove authorization beyond a reasonable doubt. The court concluded that the issue of defendant's authorization was not supported by any evidence, thus the lower court was not required to submit it to the jury, and the charge that the jury could infer non-authorization from appellant's flight and discarding the heroin was not prejudicial to defendant. The court overruled Commonwealth v. Stawinsky, 234 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prosecution challenged an order of a suppression court that suppressed the results of a blood test performed on appellee, who was charged with driving while intoxicated. The issue on appeal was whether appellee was under arrest at the time the blood test was performed, which would have made the blood test a lawful search incident to an arrest. A state police trooper ordered the blood to be taken while appellee was unconscious in the emergency room of a hospital. The appellate court noted that although appellee was unable to consent to the test, his consent would not have been necessary had he been placed under arrest. This was never done. The appellate court also noted that the officer never informed the hospital staff that appellee was under arrest and was not to leave the hospital upon regaining consciousness. Appellee was arrested 18 days after the blood sample was taken. The appellate court affirmed the order of the suppression court because no arrest was made before the blood sample was taken, and the taking of the blood sample was therefore not a search incident to arrest and was properly suppressed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder. At trial, defendant entered evidence indicating that he was intoxicated at the time of the shooting.

A jury convicted defendant of murder of the third degree for killing the victim with a shotgun, and acquitted him of charges of murder of the first and second degrees and voluntary and involuntary manslaughter. Defendant appealed contending that the court denied him due process by erroneously instructing the jury that evidence of voluntary intoxication could not serve to reduce murder of the third degree to manslaughter. The court concluded that 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.

Ann. 4323, for neglect to support a bastard. Prior to indictment being found, the trial court dismissed the charges on the ground that the statute had been ruled unconstitutional. No appeal was taken. Subsequently, the constitutionality of &sect; 4323 was upheld. Appellant then instituted a second criminal action against appellee pursuant to &sect; 4323. The trial court granted appellee's motion and quashed the information on the ground that the doctrine of double jeopardy or collateral estoppel precluded appellee's prosecution on the second criminal complaint. On appeal the issue was whether either the doctrine of double jeopardy or collateral estoppel barred the second complaint. The court reversed, holding that appellee was not placed in jeopardy in the constitutional sense under the first criminal complaint because appellee's motion to quash the transcript was granted prior to jeopardy ever attaching. The court also held 18 Pa. Cons.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital under a petition filed by her husband pursuant to the Mental Health Procedures Act, 50 P.S. &sect; 7303 (1976). Appellant sought to bar the testimony of her husband and physician as privileged. On appeal, the court remanded the order. The court held both the husband and doctor could testify. It held that a spouse who testified at a mental health proceeding in &quot;good faith&quot; relative to the mental condition of his wife was not automatically placed into a position &quot;adverse&quot; to her and in fact was the strongest and most active protector of her best interests. The court believed appellant's physician and husband were the two people who were in the best position to detect and observe her mental disability. However, even though the record showed appellant posed a &quot;clear and present danger&quot; to others, the trial court erred in having appellant committed because the certificate attached to the petition did not satisfy the requirement that a physician needed to give the reasons as to why the involuntary treatment was necessary. Because it failed to do so, appellant was deprived of her right to question the physician.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that 25 P.S. &sect; 3234 was overbroad and vague in that it provided a criminal penalty for references to an opposing candidate and was not limited to types of advertisements. Further, he called the provision a prior restraint of free expression in contravention of U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV. An equal protection argument was also raised, alleging that those candidates in urban areas with more ready and diverse forms of media coverage could give the required notice more expeditiously than those in rural areas who may have had available only periodic press coverage. The court considered that the goal of the statute was validly a part of the legislative prerogative under its police power. The court found it was a very limited restraint of free speech, applicable to those already and by their choice in the public arena as candidates. It was not unjust or unconstitutional to hold them to this duty of disclosure to their opposition, and to punish for violations thereof, when the end sought was clean, fair campaigning, a laudable goal for general conduct.</SPAN></P>

Defendant wrote a prescription for 30 dexedrine. The officer returned to defendant's office on three more occasions each time receiving a prescription for dexedrine. Defendant gave two other officers prescriptions for a controlled substance without getting the officers' medical histories. Defendant was charged and convicted of violating 35 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 780-113(a)(14). Defendant sought review of the decision and the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 780-113(a)(14) was not unconstitutionally vague because the statute did not have to delineate the precise circumstances which constituted the bounds of the permissible practice of medicine. The court held that &sect; 780-113(a)(14) gave defendant reasonable notice that his dispensing of medication without obtaining the patience's medical history, did not meet the requirements of the law.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant's representation to the victim that he was 21 and the testimony of defendant's sister established that he was 18 at the time of the offense. Her testimony was sufficient to establish his age because it was based on her positive knowledge and remembrance of the year and approximate date of his birth. The court found no constitutional invalidity in &sect; 3102, because mistake as to the age of the victim has never been a constitutional defense to statutory rape. In addition, the court held that the clear terms of &sect; 3102 represented the legislature's clear desire that, with respect to certain sexual offenses, a defendant could not prove his reasonable belief regarding the victim's age as a defense.</SPAN></P>

Cons. Stat. &sect; 3927, and for the sale of unregistered securities pursuant to Pennsylvania Securities Act, 70 P.S. &sect; 1-201 et seq. Post-verdict motions were filed and denied and defendant was sentenced to a prison term.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's corporation had been financed by investors who were general creditors of the corporation. Inevitably, bankruptcy resulted. The receiver found that no ledgers or books were kept, large sums of invested money were redirected to defendant's own use, and the corporation had issued additional unregistered promissory notes. Defendant was convicted of theft violations under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3927, and securities violations pursuant to Pennsylvania Securities Act (Securities Act), 70 P.S. &sect; 1-201 et seq. On appeal, the judgment of sentence was affirmed. The court dismissed the contention that the definition of &quot;security&quot; in the Securities Act was unconstitutionally overbroad. The court found the statute clearly defined security to include a note. Constitutionally permissible definitions were severable from the infirm ones, if any, by Securities Act, 70 P.S. &sect; 1-703(b). Also, failure to pinpoint the dates the investment monies were misappropriated was not fatal to the commonwealth's case because the evidence left no doubt that the money was misappropriated and the jury decided that defendant had accepted the money with the intent to misuse it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment of sentence against defendant for violations of the Pennsylvania Securities Act and theft of investor's funds was affirmed. The court determined that the trial court's jury instructions were sufficient and proper, challenged voir dire questions proposed by defendant were properly excluded, the Securities Act was not unconstitutionally overbroad, and the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County (Pennsylvania), following a conviction on four assault charges. Defendant claimed that the mandatory life sentence was unconstitutional, counsel was ineffective, the evidence was insufficient, and that a preliminary hearing before a non-attorney and errors in jury selection denied due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon while already serving a sentence of life imprisonment, and was given a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. The court affirmed. The mandatory sentence did not violate the federal or state constitutions. The trial court did not err in permitting prior convictions to be used to impeach defense witnesses, or in ruling that a letter from the victim's personnel records was not an admissible business record. Counsel's failure to pursue certain discovery of prison records relating to the victim's records and to other prisoner assaults was not unreasonable, was harmless error at worst, and was not ineffective representation. The jury charge was not improper. A preliminary hearing that was held before a non-attorney did not deny due process because it was followed by a trial de novo before an attorney judge. The evidence was sufficient to support the judgment. Denial of individual juror voir dire was not an abuse of trial court discretion, nor was jury selection based on voter registration lists that did not systematically exclude any cognizable group of citizens.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions for assault were affirmed, and the mandatory life sentence was constitutional. The court further held that counsel was not ineffective and that defendant was not denied due process where the preliminary hearing was held before a non-attorney. The court also held that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction, and that basing the jury panel on voter registration lists did not deny due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurance agency filed a cause of action against a third party, an out of state resident, to recover premiums on policies of insurance which appellant had placed for the third party with various insurance companies.

Appellant obtained a consent judgment against the third party, which was never paid, and appellant instituted a second action against appellee for the amount owed under the consent judgment. The trial court's judgment granting appellee's judgment on the pleadings was affirmed because the court found that the Pennsylvania foreign attachment procedure had been declared unconstitutional. The court held that where a surety bond was executed to dissolve an attachment and where the attachment was in actuality prohibited by law, the surety bond was similarly void, unenforceable and uncollectible.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of solicitation to commit murder of the husband of a woman with whom appellant had lived with for several weeks. Approximately, two hours after the jury had retired for deliberations on appellant's case, a tipstaff delivered a note to the trial court informing him that several members of the jury had information regarding appellant which was not introduced at trial. The jury was recalled and the trial court gave further instructions. Appellant's motion for a mistrial and request to voir dire the jury as to what information was referred to was denied. The court reversed the conviction and vacated the judgment of sentence because the possibility that prejudicial information reached the jury existed and the trial court did not take sufficient steps to deter the prejudicial effect. The court held that when there was a possibility of highly prejudicial materials reaching the jury, the trial court had to take appropriate protective action. Because the trial court was unaware of the nature of the information communicated to the jury, the required precautionary procedures should have included at least a determination of what information had been communicated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contested a decision from the Court of Common Pleas, Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of robbery with a weapon, criminal conspiracy, carrying firearms without a license, and burglary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his convictions for robbery with a weapon, criminal conspiracy, carrying firearms without a license, and burglary, claiming that his constitutional rights were infringed because blacks were excluded from the jury, that he should not have been made to stand for identification purposes, and that the conspiracy convictions were improper under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 903. Appellant did not have a right to exactly proportional representation of races on a jury, but deliberate and systematic exclusion of members of a race would demonstrate a prima facie case of discrimination. The court found no evidence of systematic exclusion to prevent blacks from becoming members of the jury, and the record was bare of any facts from which a constitutional violation could be inferred. Having appellant stand was not prejudicial, and in-court identification of similar physical characteristics was permissible. The court did find that when a person conspired to commit a number of crimes, he was guilty of only one conspiracy so long as the crimes were the object of the same agreement, and vacated the conviction on one of the conspiracy counts and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction of appellant on more than one conspiracy count was vacated as to one of the counts because, when a person conspired to commit a number of crimes, he was guilty of only one conspiracy so long as the crimes were the object of the same agreement.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father sought review from the judgment of sentence entered in the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County (Pennsylvania) for neglecting to support a bastard child in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 4323. Appellant claimed that his conviction was void because the statute was unconstitutional because it violated the Equal Rights Amendment of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 28 and U. S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father was charged and convicted of neglecting to support a bastard child in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 4323 (a). Appellant argued that the use of the pronoun &quot;he&quot; in the statute in issue made the statute applicable only to a male parent and, therefore, violated the state's equal rights amendment. Appellant also argued that the statute violated due process of law because it did not place a person on notice that he must contribute to the support of a child born out of wedlock and because it was unconstitutionally vague. The court rejected appellant's arguments and affirmed the judgment of sentence. The court pointed out that the rules of statutory construction applicable to statutes provided that words used in the masculine gender also included the feminine and neuter. The court also pointed out that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague simply because parentage was not determined until the trial for neglecting to support a bastard trial. The court noted that appellant had adequate notice of the charges against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of sentence against appellant father for neglecting to support a bastard child was affirmed as statute requiring appellant to support the child was not unconstitutionally vague because use of &quot;he&quot; in statute requiring parents to support bastard children permitted its application to parents of both sexes, as statute spoke in terms of &quot;parent&quot; without distinguishing between parents on basis of sex; thus, statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mortgage borrowers brought a class action against defendant lending institutions, claiming violation of trust, constructive trust, and implied contract because defendants did not pay interest on escrow payments for taxes and insurance. The trial court disapproved the proposed settlement, redefined the class, and imposed on the cost of notifying the enlarged class upon defendants. The court reversed the decision holding that the order disapproving the class settlement was appealable as a final order and appealable after it balanced the inconvenience and costs of piecemeal review and the danger of denying justice by the delay. In reviewing proposed class action settlements, the trial court had to conclude that the settlement secured an adequate advantage for the class in return for the surrender of litigation rights. The trial court was to analyze the settlement in terms of a range of reasonableness and not substitute its judgment for that of the parties. The court found that the trial court erred in concluding that two-percent interest on the loan was ridiculous, and, given the complexity of the litigation, the settlement was within the range of reasonableness.</SPAN></P>

Because the Private Detective Act of 1953 (the Act), Pa.

The trial court granted appellant a certificate of license. The district attorney petitioned to revoke the license as its investigation disclosed that appellant did not have the qualifications required. The state presented testimony from the township supervisor that appellant only handled minor juvenile disturbances and traffic accidents as a patrolman. The trial court revoked appellant's license. The court reversed the revocation concluding that the state failed to show that appellant's president was unqualified because appellant's criminal investigative work experience was the practical equivalent of regular employment as a detective over a sustained period of time.</SPAN></P>

The court found that his warrantless arrest was valid as it was based on probable cause. His trial commenced within the time required by Pa. R. Crim.

The court held that he waived his right to complain about the convictions for the two offenses, arising from the same situation, because he did not request a consolidation. Appellant's failure to timely protest the separation of the two charges evidenced his apparent willingness to undergo separate trials for each offense and therefore his double jeopardy rights under U.S. Const. amend.

The court found no infirmity of constitutional dimensions and concluded that the order appealed from did not foreclose appellant from further proceeding in the Court of Common Pleas.

Defendant appealed and the court affirmed. While there was no case law on point, the court compared the issue to other cases where it was held that a conviction for which a pardon had been granted could be considered by a court in sentencing under a second offender statute; and where it was held that a previous conviction for which a defendant had been convicted and pardoned was admissible at trial in connection with the imposition of sentence.</SPAN></P>

Appellee husband had filed an action for divorce and appellant was awarded alimony pendente lite and counsel fees. Appellant sought contempt for failure to pay alimony and counsel fees and expenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife challenged an order refusing to award retroactive alimony from the date of the divorce decree and slashing attorney fees and costs. The court reversed the lower court's order and remanded the matter. The lower court's refusal to award alimony pendente lite from the date of the divorce decree because of the non-existence of a supersedeas was an error of law. The decree divorcing the parties did not terminate appellant husband's alimony obligation. The lower court should have ordered appellee to pay appellant alimony pendente lite retroactively to the date when he violated his continuing obligation. The lower court erroneously held that any fees and expenses incurred before the effective date of an amendment to 23 P. S. &sect; 46 were not recoverable. The compensation provided for senior judges was irrelevant to an appraisal of the reasonableness of private counsel fees as was the amount of counsel fees allowed court-appointed counsel. The lower court should have considered both the value of counsel's services -- this should entail consideration of the result achieved by counsel, and of the time required to achieve it -- and the parties' respective financial situations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order of the lower court and remanded the case for the entry of a retroactive award of alimony pendente lite retroactive, and for consideration of the amount of counsel fees and expenses for appellant wife. The court instructed the trial court to take in to account appellee husband's ability to pay, appellant's necessity, and the extent of her separate estate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving while under the influence of alcohol, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3731, and challenged his conviction and sentence. He argued that the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress blood test results was erroneous. The court affirmed, holding that the police had probable cause to believe defendant was driving under the influence, as they smelled alcohol on his person, he was in a stupor, was losing consciousness, and was in an accident. The court found that the police properly took a blood test pursuant to 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1547 to determine his blood alcoholic content. The court held that the state did not need to prove that defendant was unable to submit to a breathalyzer test; it was sufficient that the police believed he was unable to so submit, based on his precarious medical condition. Even though defendant did not knowingly and voluntarily consent to the test, the court held there was no error as the police acted reasonably in ordering the test. The test was constitutional as the police had probable cause, and as defendant had no constitutional right to refuse the test, he was not entitled to any Miranda warnings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of sentence. The court held defendant's blood test was properly taken and properly admitted, as the police reasonably believed he was unable to take a breathalyzer test based on defendant's precarious medical condition. Because the police had probable cause, the search was constitutional, but because defendant had no constitutional right to refuse the test, he was not entitled to a Miranda warning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was in the shower at his home when one of his friends brought out a sawed off shotgun to show the others. The gun was accidentally fired and killed one of the friends. Appellant was convicted of possession of an offensive weapon. Appellant contended that the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutional and that his sentence was disproportionate to the crime. The court determined that the statute was not unconstitutional and did not deprive appellant of his due process rights because the burden of proof was upon the commonwealth; the part to which appellant objected was a defense only, to which appellant rightfully had the burden of proof. The court determined that the sentence was within the lawful limits and that the trial court had not abused its discretion. The court affirmed appellant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for retail theft, asserting that 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 3929(a)(1) and (a)(2) were unconstitutionally vague because they did not specify whether criminal intent was required. Appellant took a tote bag from a shelf and removed the price tags. He went into the men's department and men's fitting room. When apprehended, a store detective found that appellant was wearing a new denim suit with the plastic from the price tag still on it, the manufacturer's ticket on the back of the jacket. Appellant clothes were found in the men's fitting room. At trial, appellant's defense was that his son died and the funeral was that day. On appeal, the court addressed appellant's legal arguments as ones of statutory construction. The court held that &sect; 3929(a)(2) was not regulatory and did not require proof of criminal intent, but noted there would be no purpose in making the removal of store tickets unlawful without criminal intent. The court found that the jury instructions on criminal intent were unclear and vacated appellant's conviction on that basis.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 908, contending that the sword cane he possessed was not an offensive weapon, that the statute violated his due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and that the commonwealth failed to prove an absence of a statutory defense. The court affirmed the conviction, finding that the sword cane qualified as an offensive weapon under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 908(c) because it was capable of inflicting serious bodily injury that served no common lawful purpose. The court determined that the phrase &quot;no common lawful purpose&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague when read in conjunction with the rest of the statute concerning the sole purpose of the instrument being to inflict bodily injury. The court concluded that the commonwealth did not have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of the statutory defense in Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 908(b) pertaining to possession of a curio or antique because the defense did not negate a material element of the offense, which required defendant to prove the exception to the offense.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court affirmed, holding that the period of time that elapsed between the date of the offense and the date of appellant's arrest was not unreasonable and did not violate appellant's due process rights. The court also found that the testimony concerning an out-of-court photographic identification was not the type from which the jury could reasonably infer prior criminal conduct, and did not prejudice appellant. The commonwealth was not required to inform the jury that there was a promise to a principal witness of leniency in return for testimony against appellant, as appellant had the information and could have used it. The evidence supported the conviction and that the sale of the drug constituted a sale at retail. The Act clearly prohibited the causing of a sale at retail.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the prosecution, in timely filing petitions for extension of time and convincing the trial court of the necessity of the extensions, complied with the requirements of Pa. R. Crim.

The court found that the trial court erred when it failed to state its reasons for certification of defendant to stand trial as an adult, and that the statement violated due process requirements. The court found that none of the statutory methods of instituting juvenile proceedings was pursued by the law enforcement authorities prior to the appellant's detention, and held that after a juvenile was taken into custody, strict compliance with the provisions of the Juvenile Act by the law enforcement authorities obviated the need for any preliminary arraignment, and that the proper remedy was the suppression of prejudicial evidence obtained as a reasonable result of the unnecessary delay.

On appeal the court affirmed, holding that there was clearly sufficient evidence to prove the crime of criminal conspiracy. This evidence included testimony from two eyewitnesses as well as a pre-trial inculpatory statement made by appellant to the police that appellant was part of a gang of youths that plotted to ambush youths from a rival gang as the latter passed through the neighborhood of the former. The evidence also included appellant's admission that he shouted encouragement to his armed companion to continue shooting the victim, and a witness's testimony that he saw appellant pointing a gun at him immediately after the deceased victim was shot. The court also held that as long as the evidence was clearly sufficient, an inconsistent verdict was not grounds for granting a new trial. Finally, the court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's ruling that gave appellee commonwealth permission to impeach appellant with evidence of a prior conviction. The trial court considered all the requisite factors on the record in making its ruling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellee husband learned of appellant wife's adultery, appellee petitioned the court to reduce the amount of spousal support for appellant. The court terminated the order of support, finding appellant had committed adultery. Appellant sought review. The court held that the lower court abused its discretion by refusing to consider evidence of the husband's misconduct, and remanded the case to the trial court. The court concluded that evidence of a husband's misconduct was relevant to a proceeding to vacate a wife's support on the basis of her adultery. Although an act of adultery on the part of the husband did not give a wife a right to act forever in a licentious manner and still command support from her husband, the court held that support laws were not promulgated for the purpose of rewarding a wife's good behavior. The court held that a court should not balance the parties' misdeeds against each other, but a court must consider evidence of a husband's misconduct before it could properly exercise its discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor. After defendant was arraigned, he filed a motion to submit his case for consideration under the Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition Program (ARD), which provided for suspension of criminal proceedings before conviction on the condition that an accused fulfill a court-ordered condition. The district attorney declined to submit the case, defendant was ultimately convicted, and the trial court entered a judgment of sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that a prosecutorial decision not to move a case for ARD was not an improper delegation of sentencing power because the trial court was not prevented from placing a defendant on probation in the event of a guilty verdict. The court held that the prosecutorial policy as to exclusion of drunk drivers from ARD did not amount to a denial of equal protection because the law, as administered, dealt alike with all members of the class. The court held that exclusion of drunk drivers from ARD in Dauphin County, but not in others, did not result in a denial of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth sought review of a decision of the Court of Common Pleas (Pennsylvania), which entered an order granting defendant's motion for suppression of evidence in a prosecution for driving under the influence of alcohol.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving under the influence after he exhibited indications of intoxication at the scene of an accident, although he was not in the vehicle at the time the officers arrived. The trial court suppressed a pre-arrest statement made by defendant prior to being advised of his constitutional rights and post-arrest evidence because it was obtained pursuant to an unlawful arrest. The trial court found the arrest was unlawful because the misdemeanor did not occur in the officer's presence and was made without a warrant, in violation of Pa. R. Crim. P. 101, even though the arrest was possibly lawful under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1204(a) (1976). The trial court found that &sect; 1204(a) was inconsistent with the rule and therefore had to yield to Rule 101. The court transferred the appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court because the trial court indirectly found &sect; 1204(a) repugnant to the constitution by the judge's reliance on the reasoning of another case that found the statute unconstitutional. The court found that the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, 17 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 211.202 (1976), provided exclusive jurisdiction to the Supreme Court for this appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court transferred the Commonwealth's appeal of an order that granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court because the trial judge indirectly held that a state statute was repugnant to the Pennsylvania Constitution due to the fact that it was inconsistent with a rule of criminal procedure, and the Supreme Court was the exclusive jurisdiction for an appeal where a lower court found a law unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Police booked appellant according to normal procedure, and the charges were subsequently dismissed at the preliminary hearing. Appellant then filed a petition in which he sought to have to have the police record expunged and to have his record returned from the FBI. The lower court denied the petition on the ground that it did not have authority to grant the relief requested. The court maintained that the clear weight of authority held that one who was falsely or illegally arrested was entitled to expungement of his record and removal of his fingerprints from criminal files. The court stated that given the substantial interest of an accused in his good name and in freedom from the disability arising out of an arrest record, commonwealth was required to present compelling evidence to justify retention of such information.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court denied appellant's request for a new trial from his conviction of rape and robbery, appellant challenged the decision. The court affirmed, holding that there was no basis constitutionally to determine that the reliability of appellant's prior criminal conviction was suspect simply because an appellate court had not affirmed it on the merits. Therefore, although the general rule provided that use of convictions constitutionally invalid to impeach a defendant's credibility deprived him of due process, appellant had not shown that his rights to due process were violated. Appellant's prior criminal conviction was &quot;unconstitutional&quot; because appellant did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to appeal; then, because there was no trial transcript, a new trial was ordered and the commonwealth nol prossed it. Therefore, the general rule was wholly inappropriate in this case and the use of the prior conviction for impeachment purposes, did not require a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's denial of appellant's Post Conviction Hearing Act petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer observed appellant with nunchaku sticks in his back pockets. The officer stopped appellant, seized the nunchaku sticks, and placed appellant under arrest for possessing a prohibited offensive weapon in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 908. At his municipal court trial, appellant testified that he was on his way to karate school. Subsequently, appellant was convicted of violating &sect; 908 and placed on probation for a year. On appeal, the court vacated the sentence and discharged appellant. The court interpreted &sect; 908 and found that there was no doubt that the nunchaku sticks could be used offensively to inflict serious injury. The court, however, found that a student such as appellant or an instructor of the martial arts would have occasion to use said sticks in a peaceful practice of karate exercises. In addition, the court found that many citizens of the commonwealth practiced the martial arts as a sport and an exercise. To eliminate the use, possession, and sale of items used in said sport simply because they could conceivably be used to inflict bodily injury was contrary to the express purpose of &sect; 908.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff attorneys successfully prosecuted a workers' compensation claim on behalf of defendant demonstrator. Defendant developed the erroneous belief that plaintiffs diverted to themselves $ 25 of the fee for defendant's psychiatrist, who confirmed that he was fully paid. Defendant demonstrated against plaintiffs by pushing a shopping cart in front of their offices while ringing a cowbell and blowing a whistle and by wearing sign claiming plaintiffs stole her money. The trial court enjoined plaintiff from demonstrating against defendants or uttering defamatory statements against them. The court held that the traditional view that equity could not enjoin the publication of defamatory matter was not absolute and that application of the prohibition against prior restraint required an assessment of the particular circumstances. The court found that there was no public interest served by defendant's demonstrations. The court held that the trial court's injunction was too broad because it imposed sanctions beyond the scope of defendant's activities adjudged defamatory. Therefore, the court modified the injunction, and as modified, affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporations, which operated grocery stores, contended that the Sunday Trading Law, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;7365, was being enforced against them in an unconstitutionally discriminatory manner. The court held that laws of this nature were constitutional. The court affirmed the final decree in equity because appellants failed to establish any pattern of discriminatory enforcement. In one situation, appellants and other supermarkets were prosecuted under the statute, but eleven other retail stores were also threatened with prosecution. The court found that another appellee township, which threatened eight supermarkets including appellants, were not acting discriminatorily since thirty-five other retail stores might be warned and the prosecutions might never take place. Furthermore, the court held that to prove that a conscious policy of enforcement was not justified in this case, appellants would have had to show that other retail stores that were not prosecuted did not fall into a class of exceptions listed under 18 Pa Cons. Stat. &sect;7364(c). Appellants failed to show this discriminatory action.</SPAN></P>

XIV. The court affirmed the conviction, finding that the aforementioned statute, which permitted defendant's refusal to consent to a chemical test of his breath to be admitted into evidence as a factor to be considered in determining guilt or innocence, did not violate defendant's due process rights because the inference to be drawn from such evidence was not the sole element of appellant' s guilt, and, therefore, the inference did not have to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The court concluded that there was direct evidence of defendant's guilt and the inference drawn from the refusal was just one piece of circumstantial evidence tending to prove the ultimate fact, and, under such circumstances, the inferred fact from the refusal did not have to follow beyond a reasonable doubt from the proved facts because the totality of the evidence established defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant police officers and officials executed a search warrant on plaintiff business and discovered evidence of counterfeit goods and illegal transactions that occurred in another state. Plaintiff filed a declaratory action in equity court, requesting the equity court to find that the search and seizure conducted by defendants was illegal and to enjoin defendants from sending the evidence to officials in the other state. Defendants argued that the equity court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin a criminal proceeding. The trial court enjoined defendants from using the evidence and from sending the evidence to the other state. Defendants sought review. The court reversed, finding that the equity court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin criminal proceedings, because pursuant to Pa. R. Crim. P. 324, only the criminal courts had authority to prevent the use of unlawfully seized evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to quash was denied, the decree was reversed, and the complaint in equity for injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a petition for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. The trial court denied the petition because of an administrative order that required the payment of fines prior to the taking of an appeal from a summary conviction. On review, appellant contended that the conditioning of his appeal upon payment of a fine and costs amounted to a denial of due process and equal protection. The court agreed with this contention. The court found that the trial court improperly applied the administrative order requiring the payment of fines and costs as a condition to the appeal. The court determined that Pa. R. Crim. P. 67 did not require payment of costs or fines as a precondition to an appeal. Furthermore, the administrative order was not enforceable because it conflicted with Rule 67 by requiring proof of the payment of fines and costs to perfect an appeal. Lastly, the court reasoned that the payment of a fine as a condition precedent to an appeal was an unconstitutional denial of an appeal, therefore the court gave a construction to Rule 67 and the administrative order that was constitutional. Accordingly, the court reversed the order with a procedendo.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the magistrate in the asylum state was not required to make a finding of probable cause before extradition could be granted. Although there was an error as to the date of the alleged Tennessee crime in the extradition papers, the court held that the total effect of the documents was to substantially support the charge, and that the commonwealth introduced sufficient evidence at the habeas corpus hearing to show appellant's presence in the demanding state at the time of the alleged crime.

Appellant denied paternity and presumably requested that he be tried by a jury. At trial appellant asked the trial court to charge that appellee had the burden of proving paternity beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court instructed the jury that paternity had to be proved only by a preponderance of the evidence. Appellant contended that the charge was erroneous. The court reversed the order and ordered that appellant be discharged because the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The court held that the lack of subject matter jurisdiction could never be waived and could be raised at any stage in the proceedings by the parties or by the court on its own motion. The court held that a criminal proceeding on the issue of paternity, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 4323, was mandatory absent an express waiver by appellant.

The court held that there was no showing of any prejudice to appellant by the announcement of the verdict and sentence by certified mail two days after the hearing rather than in open court. The court also held that the record refuted any implication that the magistrate regarded the case as a civil case instead of a criminal one and that the magistrate applied the burden of proof of a preponderance of the evidence instead of beyond a reasonable doubt. The court stated that the complaint was clearly labelled &quot;criminal complaint.&quot; The court also stated that certification by the magistrate was that there was probable cause for the issuance of process. The court noted that the transcript made up by the magistrate was conspicuously labelled &quot;summary conviction.&quot; The court concluded that the finding of the magistrate of a verdict of guilty indicated a clear understanding that he was dealing with a criminal case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County (Pennsylvania), rendered a judgment of life imprisonment against defendant for simple assault and assault by a life prisoner. Defendant contended that the state failed to prove the essential elements of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2704 and life imprisonment for a simple assault constituted cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the way to the hole, defendant struck one of the guards on the back of the neck, and the guard's injuries caused the guard to miss work for a three hours on one day and the greater part of the next day. Defendant was convicted of simple assault and assault by a life prisoner, and sentenced to life imprisonment as mandated by 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2704. Defendant contended that the state failed to prove every element of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2704; however, the court found the testimony of the struck guard and another guard to be sufficient. Defendant also contended that &sect; 2704 punishment of life imprisonment for a simple assault committed by a prisoner constituted cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the fixing of penalties for crimes was a legislative function, and it was a maxim of constitutional law that the legislature will be presumed to have acted within constitutional limits. The court concluded that an appellate court should not declare an act of assembly void unless its violation of the constitution was so clear as to preclude doubt or hesitation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried by a jury on three bills of indictment charging defendant with murder, possession of a firearm without a license, and two counts of pointing and discharging a deadly weapon.

Defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 18 to 36 months and to pay the costs of prosecution. After defendant served the minimum prison term and was released, he petitioned the court to remit any amount already paid in excess of his determined cost to prosecute. The court reversed the trial court's order denying defendant's petition and remanded the case to the lower court to determine what portion of the costs, if any, were necessary to try defendant on those charges which resulted in acquittal, and to modify its order imposing costs in accordance with the findings. The court held that defendant could not be ordered to pay the costs of prosecuting the felony charge because he was acquitted, and thus could only be charged the portion of the costs necessary to convict him on the misdemeanor charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following appellant's conviction for various sex offenses and kidnapping, he did not file post-trial motions, but he did file pro se a post-conviction petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, 19 P.S. &sect; 1180-1 et seq., (1975), which the trial court denied without appointing counsel and without a hearing. The court quashed his appeal and found that trial counsel was incompetent for not preserving appellant's issues for review by failing to file post-trial motions. The court found that appellate counsel was incompetent by not requesting a remand of the record for an evidentiary hearing on whether appellant voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to file post-trial motions. The court found that, because no post-trial motions were filed, whether the trial court erred in denying appellant's petition without appointing counsel and without a hearing was the only appealable issue and that appellant's counsel brief did not address it. Appellant's brief addressed only the kidnapping conviction and sentence and it was filed too late to be timely with regard to those issues.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of selling obscene literature in violation of 18 P.S. &sect; 4524. The jury returned verdicts against both defendants convicting them of the offense as charged. The sole issue defendants addressed to the court on appeal was whether &sect; 4524 passed constitutional muster in light of the test for state regulation of obscenity announced in 1973 by the United States Supreme Court. The court held that under that standard, it was apparent that the statute was constitutionally deficient because it did not specifically define the sexual conduct that it purported to proscribe. This court noted the importance of this element, because without it an individual is effectively deprived of notice as to what type of depictions in his literature will result in the imposition of criminal sanctions. The court also cited a recent decision in which it held that &sect; 4524 was unconstitutional because it failed to specifically defined the type of conduct it purported to describe. Because the statute under which defendants were convicted did not comply with constitutional requirements, the court held that their convictions had to be reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After petitioner parolee was charged with simple assault and public intoxication, respondent Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole, issued a warrant to commit and detain petitioner for violating his parole.

After pleading guilty to the lesser offense of disorderly conduct, petitioner was given written notice of his alleged parole violations. After a violation hearing, respondent recommitted petitioner to serve his backtime, based on petitioner's disorderly conduct, assaultive behavior, and his consumption of alcohol, and denied a request for administrative relief.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Department of Environmental Resources sought an application for special relief to determine the constitutionality of the Regulatory Review Act (the Act), 71 PA. Stat. &sect;&sect; 745.1 -- 745.15, in opposition to respondent, the Pennsylvania Senate. The court had to determine whether the Act violated the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers between and among the branches of the commonwealth's government. The court found that although &sect; 2 of the Act contained a disclaimer that the Act was not intended to create rights or benefits, it was apparent that the Independent Regulatory Review Commission's (IRRC) action in blocking the required publication of a regulation was an impediment to the executive's rule-making authority inherent in its duty to administer the laws. The court held that petitioner met its burden of proving that the Act violated the separation of powers doctrine. Accordingly, the court granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment and held &sect;&sect; 6(b) and 7(b) of the Act unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Respondent Department of Public Welfare affirmed a determination by the office of hearings and appeals that petitioner's entire pension was available to pay for his nursing home care, and petitioner sought review. The court affirmed. The court held that respondent neither erred nor acted arbitrarily without statutory support when it applied the name-on-the-instrument rule to determine ownership of petitioner's pension. The court held also that application of the rule did not amount to an infringement of a right to marital privacy, and that the rule did not employ an impermissible irrebuttable presumption that operated to deny due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because of improper conduct, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court directed that petitioner judge be removed from judicial office, that petitioner's salary cease, and that he be thereafter ineligible to hold judicial office. Petitioner filed an application with the State Employes' Retirement Board, seeking a reduced retirement allowance for life. Respondent, without giving petitioner notice or the opportunity to be heard, denied the application and asserted that with the exception of petitioner's own contributions to the system and the statutory interest on those contributions, he was precluded from receiving his retirement benefits, pursuant to Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 16(b). Petitioner appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed respondent's decision and held that the question of whether petitioner was entitled to retirement benefits was properly presented to respondent, that application of &sect; 16(b) to petitioner did not impair his statutory contractual rights, that a hearing was not constitutionally required, and that the voters did not act irrationally when they placed judges in a separate classification from other state employees in &sect; 16(b).</SPAN></P>

The court reviewed analogous cases and statutes and held that principles of statutory construction, including 1 Pa. Cons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Common Pleas Court, Fayette County (Pennsylvania), which sentenced appellant to pay fines and court costs for the violation of an ordinance requiring a person engaged in peddling to obtain a $ 20 license. Appellant was found guilty of violating the ordinance after appellant, who had not obtained a license, attempted to distribute a political newspaper for a donation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant distributed a social worker's party newspaper for a donation. Thereafter, appellant was arrested for violating an ordinance that required a person engaged in peddling to apply for a license, the fee for which was $ 20 per day. After appellant was sentenced to pay fines and court costs for violating the ordinance, appellant sought review, and the court reversed. The court found that appellant's conduct had not been one of commercial nature but had instead been political activity protected by U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV. The court found that appellant's activity had been political in nature because appellant's primary purpose had been to discuss political ideas, appellant had offered older copies of the newspaper for free, and appellant's small monetary gain had not been analogous to the commercial activity of door-to-door selling of subscriptions to national periodicals, newspapers, and magazines. Finally, the court found that the licensing fee had rendered the ordinance unconstitutional pursuant to amends. I, XIV and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 because the fee had made it impossible to disseminate political ideas and speech through door-to-door solicitation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed a judgment sentencing appellant to pay fines and court costs for violation of an ordinance requiring a peddler to obtain a license because appellant's dissemination of political newspapers was not commercial activity but instead, was political activity protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments and because the licensing fee unconstitutionally restricted appellant's ability to disseminate political ideas.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the order awarding pension benefits with interest to appellees, holding that the plain language of appellant city's ordinance provided that appellees, who were survivors of members who died after the effective date of the ordinance were entitled to that member's pension and that the payment of interest was proper under &sect; 8303 of the Judicial Code (Code), 42 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant vending machine owners filed a complaint in equity against appellees, city, mayor, city council, and police commissioner, alleging that Phila., Pa.

The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment; the trial court granted summary judgment to appellees. The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to appellees on the grounds that the trial court had properly declined to exercise equity jurisdiction because appellants had failed to pursue adequate and available administrative remedies. It rejected appellants' argument that the administrative process acted as a prior restraint on their freedom of speech and was therefore inadequate because appellant city had no discretion to refuse to issue registration tags to appellants once the tax was paid. The court concluded that the case did not fall within the constitutional attack exception to the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine because in order to fall within the exception a party had to attack the constitutionality of the statute as a whole.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner physician sought review of a decision from respondent State Board of Medicine (Pennsylvania), which found that petitioner committed acts constituting immoral and unprofessional conduct in violation of 63 P.S. &sect; 421.15(a)(8) of the Medical Practice Act of 1974, and revoked his license to practice medicine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner physician was accused of committing acts constituting immoral and unprofessional conduct in violation of 63 P.S. &sect; 421.15(a)(8) of the Medical Practice Act of 1974, and was brought before a hearing examiner for respondent State Board of Medicine (Board). The hearing examiner determined that petitioner was guilty of the acts charged, his license to practice medicine was to be suspended for five years, and that he was to submit to the care, counseling or treatment of a physician or physicians designated by the Board. The prosecuting attorney requested the Board's review of this determination, asking for a harsher sentence. Petitioner requested that the Board hold an evidentiary hearing, and permit the filing of briefs and oral argument. The Board denied petitioner's request and granted that of the prosecutor, altering the punishment to revocation of his license. On appeal, the court vacated the decision, finding that petitioner's claim of laches was a bar the proceedings if petitioner proved that he was prejudiced by the undue delay of his victims in reporting the incidents to the board. The matter was remanded for the board to make factual determinations on laches.</SPAN></P>

Appellee then filed a motion for summary judgment contending that, based upon an amendment to it regulations, the annual permit fee assessed against all off-premises car rental businesses was 10% of gross revenues and that appellee could, pursuant to the Municipal Authorities Act of 1945 (the Act), 53 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 301-401, required appellant to pay this permit fee. The lower court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee. Appellant challenged the lower court's decision. The court affirmed, holding that the Act provided municipalities with wide discretion in determining how to conduct their business and that the permit fee was a power conveyed to it under the Act. The court further held that appellee was not indirectly competing with appellant's business; rather, appellee was attempting to recoup expenses it incurred in operating the airport and the permit fee was a cost which appellant must expend to have done business.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the decision of the PUC, holding that the PUC's conclusion as to the unreasonableness of petitioner's expenses was legally correct, and that it was supported by substantial evidence in the record. The court held that the PUC was not preempted from disallowing expenses incurred as a result of a purchase at a rate approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), as petitioner voluntarily entered into the sale and buyback agreement, and the FERC did not mandate the purchase or otherwise limit petitioner's option for purchasing power. The court held that the PUC's decision was simply a state determination that petitioner's agreement to purchase power at the FERC-approved rate was unreasonably excessive when lower cost power was readily available elsewhere.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Department of Transportation (Pennsylvania) found that appellant had violated &sect; 1103(d) of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.

After a de novo hearing, the trial court affirmed the decision. Appellant argued that it was denied due process and that appellee improperly considered evidence of appellant's prior violations. The court affirmed the order, holding that appellant was not denied due process, as 67 Pa. Code &sect;&sect; 43.11 and 53.9 did not require that a hearing be held prior to the issuance of a warning. Moreover, appellee did not err in failing to inform appellant of his right to counsel, as the Administrative Agency Law, 2 Pa. Cons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees owned a house, which was rented without a license to tenants in 1987 and 1988. Appellant informed appellees that the rental of their property without obtaining a license constituted a violation of the Housing Maintenance and Occupancy Code (Housing Code). Pursuant to 53 P.S. &sect; 108.4(1), appellant sought to restrain appellees from continuing to violate its Housing Code by submitting to an inspection and obtaining a license for a leased residential property owned by appellees. Subsequently, the court of common pleas dismissed appellant's action in equity because such action was inappropriate. The court of common pleas found that the summary of criminal proceedings permitted by the Housing Code were available to appellant as a remedy to correct the problem of appellees' noncompliance. On appeal, the court vacated the order and remanded the matter for further proceedings. The court found that appellant's Housing Code called for the availability of an action in equity in order to enforce housing codes.

On further appeal, the court affirmed the order dismissing the appeal and quashed the appeal filed from the denial of the request for post-trial relief. Substantial evidence supported appellee's designation of the building's exterior as historic. The court further held that, pursuant to Philadelphia, Pa., Code &sect; 12-2007(2)(b) and &sect; 12-2007(4), appellee had the authority to designate as historic the building's interior. The court finally concluded that appellee's designation of the interior of the building as historic was not an unconstitutional exercise of the state's police powers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent State Ethics Commission (Pennsylvania) filed preliminary objections to a petition for review in the nature of an action for declaratory judgment, in which petitioners, three city councilmen, asked the court to enjoin respondent's investigation of them for alleged violations of the Public Officials Ethics Act, 65 P.S. &sect;&sect; 401- 413, and to declare the investigation unlawful and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent State Ethics Commission initiated an investigation of petitioners, three city councilmen, to determine whether they had hired their spouses in violation of the Public Officials Ethics Act, 65 P.S. &sect;&sect; 401- 413. Petitioners filed a petition for review in the nature of an action for declaratory judgment, to which respondent filed preliminary objections. The court overruled the preliminary objections, determining that relief under the Declaratory Judgments Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 7531- 7541, was appropriate. This was not a case where a statute called for specialized fact-finding or application of an agency's administrative expertise. Petitioners raised substantial constitutional questions and challenged respondent's authority to proceed with its investigation, questioning whether respondent's investigatory powers over petitioners collided with the home rule authority granted to the city by Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2. The challenge went to the heart of respondent's power. The court therefore directed respondents to file an answer to the petition, and directed petitioners to serve the petition on the Pennsylvania Attorney General pursuant to Pa. R. App. P. 1514(c).</SPAN></P>

The court found that appellee had a substantial and legitimate interest in enacting an ordinance regulating the location of adult establishments, and the ordinance allowed for reasonable alternatives for communication. The court found that appellant did not meet its burden of proving that there were no alternative locations, and appellant's argument that other locations were not as desirable was without merit, as U.S. Const. amend. I did not promise a desirable location. The court also upheld the amortization clause because appellant's inventory was mostly monthly publications, expenses incurred after the enactment were incurred at appellant's own risk, appellant could break its lease, and other expenses could be used at a different location.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a public official, sought review of an order of respondent Pennsylvania State Ethics Commission. Respondent found that petitioner had violated the State Ethics Act, 65 P.S. &sect; 403(a), by using his public office for a financial gain by a member of his family. Petitioner alleged that no penalty could be imposed where intent was lacking and that the monies would result in unjust enrichment. Further, he contended that &sect; 403(a) was unconstitutional because it imposed criminal penalties for unknowing violations. The court held that a public officer was disqualified from voting in any matter in which he had a personal interest, as did petitioner, whose indirect financial interest presented the appearance of a conflict with the public trust, even if that was not his intent. The court ruled that, unless petitioner divested himself of the financial gain by returning the monies paid to his family member, a recommendation for prosecution could result. The court found that the constitutional challenge failed because petitioner had not been subjected to any criminal penalties and that the penalty provisions challenged were not applicable. The order of respondent was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court vacated the chancellor's decree nisi. The court reversed and remanded the trial court's order and reinstated the decree nisi. The court held that though appellants did not show that they had a direct, immediate, and substantial interest in their claim, they met the required special circumstances that gave them standing to challenge the constitutionality of the award of veteran's points under Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7103(b). The court found that redress through another channel was unavailable and that there were no other persons better situated to assert the claim. The court found that the veteran's points awarded to the chief of police under &sect; 7103(b) were given before his examination was scored and that there were no established grounds for revoking such points. The court held that &sect; 7103(b) granted a special privilege to the chief of police in violation of Pa. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, builders and building association, and respondent Pennsylvania Department of Revenue filed cross-motions for summary judgment in petitioners' action seeking a declaration that a provision of the Realty Transfer Tax Article of the Tax Reform Code of 1971, 72 P.S. &sect;&sect; 8101-C to 8112-C, which made some real estate improvement contracts taxable, was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner builders sold empty lots to buyers who entered into executory contracts with petitioners for the later construction of houses on those lots. Prior to the 1986 amendments to the Tax Reform Code, those buyers paid transfer tax only on the value of the lot while other buyers who purchased newly constructed homes, where the lot and the finished house were sold together, paid transfer tax on the value for both. The 1986 amendments to 72 P.S. &sect;&sect; 8101-C to 8112-C imposed the transfer tax on petitioner builders' buyers for the value of the soon-to-be-built house as well as the lot. Petitioners claimed this method of determining value was invalid. The court decided the Department of Revenue's use of petitioners' executory contracts was a valid method of valuation for taxable transfers as defined in the transfer tax provisions. Petitioners' arrangement was a loophole properly closed by taxing all new home sales uniformly on the full monetary worth of the interest in real estate conveyed. The tax scheme met constitutional muster because there existed an adequate basis for classifying petitioners' construction contracts as part of the value of a bargained-for conveyance of land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment for respondent department of revenue was granted. Petitioner builders who sold lots and contracted for future building of houses did not invalidate the method of valuing real estate subject to transfer tax because the method required all home buyers to pay tax on the full consideration for both house and lot. Petitioners' contracts were not taxable, but they could properly be used to determine the value subject to tax.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police officer retired after contributing a portion of his salary, overtime, and extra work pay to a pension fund. Appellee borough refused to include the overtime and extra work pay in calculating his retirement benefits. Appellant filed a complaint in mandamus and both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted appellee's motion and denied appellant's motion. On review, the court affirmed. The court noted that appellant improperly filed the action in mandamus because appellee was performing its duty in paying appellant a pension. The court did not address appellant's extra work contributions because that pay was governed by a separate and distinct agreement. Appellant's overtime pay was properly left out of appellee's calculations because utilizing the uniform base salaries of eligible employees enabled municipalities, such as appellee, to predict with greater precision the amount of pension benefits, thus contributing to the maintenance of a stable fund. Appellant did not suffer an adverse unilateral modification in the retirement system because he had no right to an increased pension as a result of his contributions from his overtime pay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer stopped appellant driver while he was operating his car. The office noted appellant's slurred speech and a strong odor of alcohol on appellant's breath. After appellant was notified he was being placed under arrest, he was transported to a local hospital for a blood test to determine his blood alcoholic level. When appellant refused the test, he was advised that his refusal would result in a one year suspension of his driving privileges. The court affirmed the order of the lower court that dismissed a driver's license suspension appeal, in favor of appellee state driver's licensing bureau, because the only fact necessary to the administrative determination suspending driving privileges was appellant's refusal to comply with the blood test request after being taken into custody. Moreover, the police officer had a reasonable belief that appellant was driving while under the influence of alcohol. The court held that the township's policy of requiring a blood test among the three enumerated chemical tests under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1547 was not unconstitutional because &sect; 1547 allowed, rather than required, the use of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed a declaratory action challenging the constitutionality of Pa. Const. art.

Intervenor judges then appeared in the action with the parties' consent. Petitioner and intervenors filed a motion for summary relief. The court overruled defendant's objections, and denied the motion for summary relief. The court held that Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 16(b), did not violate Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The court held that Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 16(b), did not discriminate against judges in the exercise of a civil right under Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 25. The court held that elected judges in Pennsylvania were excluded from the protection of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. However, the court held that the petition did state a claim insofar as it alleged that Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 16(b), violated the due process and equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant club challenged the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (Pennsylvania), which affirmed the orders of appellee Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board.

Appellant was issued a 30 day suspension for one violation and a revocation for the other violation. Appellant sought review and the trial court affirmed appellee Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board's decision. Appellant again sought review and contended that 47 P.S. 4-493(12) was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed and found that difficulty in ascertaining whether a violation falls under statutory language did not necessarily render the statute unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court found that the &quot;catch-all&quot; provision of &sect; 4-493(12) afforded sufficient warning as the prohibited behavior. The court found that appellant was not subjected to double jeopardy because there was no criminal trial. The court found that 47 P.S. &sect; 4-471 did not require that appellant receive actual notice of the alleged violations. Finally, the court found that there was substantial evidence to support the finding that appellant served liquor to a non-member.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court issued two orders that affirmed appellee zoning board's decision to deny appellant billboard advertiser variances to erect two outdoor billboards. Appellee's zoning ordinance limited the sign area of off-premises signs, such as billboards, to 200 square feet. Appellant's proposed billboard would have required a total sign area of 300 square feet. The court held that respondent acted properly in denying appellant's application for special exceptions because it did not qualify for the height and size variances. The two applications did not satisfy the requirements of the applicable ordinance. The evidence was insufficient to sustain the granting of the variance. Moreover, the mere fact that a municipal zoning ordinance does not permit the use of standardized signs was insufficient to constitute a unique hardship. Finally, the court rejected appellant's various constitutional arguments.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the provisions of the election code which prevented convicted felons from voting by absentee ballot did not violate the state constitution because the legislature had the power to except persons confined in a penal institution from the class of qualified electors. Additionally, prisoners who had been deprived of their liberty by society did not have a right to be transported to their regular polling places to register and to vote, nor did they have a right to compel the state to provide them with registration and polling places within the confines of their respective state correctional institutions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county judges, who were responsible for court system administration, filed an action in mandamus against defendant commonwealth officials. Plaintiffs sought relief in the nature of compliance by defendants with the commonwealth supreme court's decision that directed the general assembly to enact appropriate county court funding legislation. City officials intervened as party-plaintiffs. The court sustained defendants' preliminary objections and dismissed the action, finding that plaintiffs' complaint failed to meet the requirements for an action in mandamus and that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the suit. The court determined that the supreme court's directive did not compel performance by the general assembly within a specified time and, thus, there was no present obligation to perform. Because the supreme court's order was entered only seven months prior to plaintiffs' suit, the court determined there was no unreasonable delay by defendants. The court also found that no present emergency for which defendants were responsible had arisen which jeopardized the efficient administration of justice and which necessitated plaintiffs' standing in the litigation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state employees filed a motion for summary judgment in petitioner's action against respondent Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Education, in their action for a declaratory judgment that the State Adverse Interest Act, 71 P.S. &sect;&sect; 776.1-776.8, did not bar petitioners from supplemental employment with entities with which respondent had contracts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state employees were educators who wanted to teach night courses at various universities. Respondent Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Education, denied their applications for approval, because respondent had contracts with the universities, and &sect; 5 of the State Adverse Interest Act (Act), 71 P.S. &sect; 776.5, stated that no employee could have an adverse interest in any contract with the state agency by which he was employed. Despite the fact that &sect;&sect; 2(4), 2(2), of the Act, 71 P.S. &sect;&sect; 776.2(4), 776.2(2), defined &quot;adverse interest&quot; and &quot;contract&quot; so as to encompass the prospective employment, the court granted petitioners' motion. Finding that the prospective employment was in no way actually adverse to respondent, the court relied on &sect;&sect; 1921, 1922 of the Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1921, 1922, to construe the Act in a manner that avoided what the court considered an absurd or unintended result, and held that where the only connection between an employee's state employment and the requested supplemental employment consisted of unrelated contracts between the state and the proposed supplemental employer, the Act did not apply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted petitioner state employees' motion for summary judgment and declared that the provisions of the Adverse Interest Act were inapplicable to requests for supplemental employment in the absence of a determination that an actual adverse interest was present, and ordered respondent Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Education, to grant petitioners' requests for supplemental employment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, the commonwealth and its legislature, demurred to a complaint filed by petitioners, citizens and taxpayers of the commonwealth, alleging that pay raises and unvouchered expense allowances enacted by and paid to respondent legislature were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent legislature argued that a complaint filed by petitioners, citizens and taxpayers, challenging on constitutional grounds an act granting legislators pay raises and expense allowances was barred by the Speech or Debate Clause of Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 15. The court agreed, explaining that the immunity of legislators must be absolute as to actions taken in their legitimate legislative sphere, not only as to the results of litigation against them but also to relieve them of the necessity of defending themselves. Moreover, the court agreed with respondent commonwealth's assertion that the complaint failed to state a cause of action. The increase in the unvouchered expense account afforded to current legislators did not violate Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 8, as this provision only barred increases in &quot;salary,&quot; and such increases did not constitute compensation for services rendered. And the constitutional prohibition against voting on bills in which legislators had an interest only applied to interests of which other members were unaware. Finally, petitioners' failure to demonstrate any constitutional violation precluded a challenge to the nonseverability provision of the act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Demurrers filed by respondents, the commonwealth and its legislature, sustained in complaint filed by petitioners taxpayers alleging that future pay raises and current unvouchered expense allowances enacted by and to be paid to respondent legislators were unconstitutional, as respondent legislators enjoyed absolute immunity as to actions taken in their legislative sphere, and as expense increases were not constitutionally proscribed &quot;salary.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The court rejected petitioner's interpretation of &sect; 445.4(b)(2)(i) pursuant to the Act, 36 P.S. &sect; 2718.105(c)(2)(v), because the legislature did not, and the court could not, insert the regulation into the Act.

The actions below arose out of a motor vehicle accident which occurred while appellee former employees were within the scope of their employment for appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer filed petitions to intervene in tort actions filed by appellees, former employees and their families, seeking to establish a right of subrogation, reimbursement or set-off by reason of the workmen's compensation benefits paid to appellees against any sums payable as a result of the suit. The petitions were denied and appellant sought review of the trial court's decision. The court ruled that the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1701-1798, plainly prohibited subrogation or reimbursement from a claimant's tort recovery with respect to workers' compensation benefits. Appellant's challenge to the constitutionality of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1720 was also unsuccessful. The court ruled that the statute, which barred subrogation, was reasonable and bore a real and substantial relation to the object of the legislation. The court held that 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1720 barred subrogation in the appellees' actions because the underlying actions clearly arose from the use of a motor vehicle and the theory of liability asserted against each defendant did not affect the nature of the action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, petitioners, seasonal workers and union, appealed from the orders of respondent, Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, granting seasonal status to fruit or vegetable processing operations of employers pursuant to the Unemployment Compensation Law, 43 P.S. &sect; 802.5. Petitioners alleged that the board erred in finding that 43 P.S. &sect; 802.5 authorization and determination procedures were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four employers were granted seasonal status under 43 P.S. &sect; 802.5 for a processing operation of perishable fruits or vegetables in a fresh state. Judicially noting that perishable fruits or vegetables must be processed promptly and that the statute comports with common knowledge that weather conditions affect harvesting, the court concluded that &quot;climatic conditions&quot; made it impossible or impractical for the employers to carry on operations for more than 180 days. Portions of the employers' seasonal business were &quot;functionally distinct&quot; operations as certain equipment was used and operated by seasonal employees only when the seasonal operation was carried on. The statute did not violate the guarantees under Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 32, and the legislation was not enacted in violation of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 1-4. The procedures set forth in 43 P.S. &sect; 802.5 for seasonal determinations did not violate petitioners' constitutional right to procedural due process as such determination did not adjudicate petitioners' rights to collect benefits. Failure to post an application did not preclude a grant of seasonal status.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The orders of respondent, Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Board, granting seasonal status to employers' fruit and vegetable procession operations were affirmed, because respondent properly found that climatic conditions made it impossible to carry on functionally distinct operations more than 180 days a year, and the governing statute and procedures complied with the mandates of state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was no provision for discovery proceedings before a school board, and that because there had been conferences and correspondence regarding specific objections to petitioner's teaching of religion, he could not now say he did not understand what was prohibited. The court held that petitioner's repeated references in the classroom to Christianity, God, the devil and demons, exceeded the constitutional boundaries within which discourse about religion was permissible.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employer appealed from an order of respondent Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board (Pennsylvania), which affirmed the award of fatal claim benefits rendered by its referee to respondent claimant, on the ground that respondent claimant's husband died as a result of a fatal disease he contracted from a co-worker while he was within the course of his employment, as set forth in 77 P.S. &sect; 411(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent husband died of complications from meningococcal septicemia. When decedent's co-workers were tested, one employee whom he had kissed on the cheek days before his death was found to be a carrier of the disease. On appeal from an award of fatal benefits to respondent claimant, the court held that decedent's act of goodwill toward his co-worker was neither foreign to his employment, nor did it constitute an abandonment thereof. The court thus found that decedent was within the course of employment when the event occurred which activated his injury and death as understood under 77 P.S. &sect; 411(1). The court affirmed, holding that a disease contracted solely because a co-worker had communicated that disease was a compensable injury under the Act because the Act did not require added or peculiar risks, but simply compensated for injuries arising within the course of employment. Petitioner employer waived its claim of unconstitutionality by failing to raise the issue in its appeal to respondent Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board. There was sufficient unequivocal medical testimony to show that decedent's fatal disease was contracted at work from a co-worker.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of respondent Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board awarding fatal claim benefits to respondent claimant was affirmed on the ground that the fatal contagious disease contracted by decedent husband from a co-worker was an injury arising in the course of employment, and was therefore compensable. The referee's findings in this regard were supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

Respondent filed objections alleging that the court did not have jurisdiction because petitioners did not challenge the regulations before the Environmental Hearing Board. The court sustained respondent's objections and transferred the action to the Board because petitioners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. In addition, the issues involved were highly technical and factually complex so that the Board was better prepared to address such issues. The Board had superior expertise in the field.

Appellants' contention that the hearing provided after the declaration of taking did not satisfy due process was without merit. Appellants were given the opportunity to meet their burden of proving that the blight certification was arbitrary, but failed to do so. The lapse of time between taking and blight certification did not so disable appellants from proving their allegations as to rise to the level of a constitutional violation. The Authority could not be held to have abandoned the redevelopment project because renewal was a slow process. The Authority presented uncontradicted evidence of blight and it could not be said that the determination went stale. Certification of blight was not subject to the Local Agency Law, 2 Pa. Cons.

On appeal, petitioner claimed that respondent board lacked discretionary authority under &sect; 307(7) to deny a petition where petitioner proved its case. The court agreed and reversed respondent board's order. Respondent lacked authority to order a mere suspension instead of a termination and also lacked the authority to choose not to impose termination because the legislature chose to make as a requirement of continued benefits that a widow forgo a meretricious relationship.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment against appellant in the amount of approximately $ 9,600. Appellant sought review, and the court affirmed. The court rejected appellant's argument that &sect; 34 was a local or special law regulating the affairs of townships and thus a violation of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 32. Section 34 had statewide application in that it applied to townships of the first class throughout the commonwealth. The court also held that &sect; 34 did not violate Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 3. The title of the law clearly alerted a reasonable person that the law related to collection of taxes and was conferring powers on tax collectors. Implicit in the title was the power of a tax collector to receive compensation. The court held that the $ 10,000 limitation of &sect; 34 would apply to moneys received by appellant but assessed and collected by others pursuant to the Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. &sect;&sect; 6901-6924.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was found guilty of the violations, and appellant's post-trial motions for arrest of judgment and for a new trial were denied. Appellant sought review, and the court affirmed. The court found the evidence sufficient. The agent's eyewitness testimony was not so weak and inconclusive as to warrant an arrest of judgment. The court held that &sect;&sect; 6018.610(2), 6018.610(4) encompassed the act of &quot;depositing&quot; solid waste if it is in violation of the regulations of appellee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee sheriff denied appellant's application for a license to carry a concealed weapon. The trial court found appellant pulled a gun from his holster, waved it about, and said that this is how he gets his work done. Appellant challenged the trial court's dismissal of his mandamus action in which he sought to compel appellee to issue a license. On appeal, the court found the legislature's intent in the Pennsylvania Uniform Firearms Act, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6109 was to make the issuance of a firearms license not mandatory, but discretionary. Appellee was empowered to exercise judgment in applying the statute's standards to decide if appellant should have been licensed. Because appellant had an adversarial hearing, focusing on his need and fitness for such a firearms license, appellant's constitutionally protected right to bear arms was not violated. The court also held that because the Pennsylvania Uniform Firearms Act, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6110 named certain persons, such as habitual drunkards, persons of unsound mind, and persons convicted of a crime of violence, ineligible to carry a firearm, the sheriff was not limited to denying firearms licenses only to such persons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was affirmed because appellee sheriff's denial of a firearms license to appellant was soundly based upon the need and suitability criteria of the Firearms Act.</SPAN></P>

Its contractor applied for a public bathing plan permit under Pa. Code &sect; 193.14, which was denied by respondent Environmental Hearing Board. Neither petitioner nor the contractor appealed the decision. Later, &sect; 193.14 was amended to exclude condominium pools from the permit requirement. Six years thereafter, petitioner applied for a permit, but requested to withdraw its application. Respondent granted summary judgment for the state agency in affirming the denial of a permit and request to withdraw. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and held that issue preclusion did not bar petitioner from challenging the decision because of the intervening change in the legal context exception. Petitioner could not have litigated the amendment to the permit requirement because its present claim of a valid legal status for a permit was different from its claim prior to the amendment. Inequitable administration of the law would result if petitioner were precluded, on an administrative finality, from arguing the permit requirement no longer applied to it while similarly situated persons would not be precluded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, class of seasonal workers, sought to have Unemployment Compensation Law, 43 P.S. &sect; 802.5, declared unconstitutional, and sought an injunction against further application of the &sect; 802.5, which provided that unemployment compensation benefits would not be paid to seasonal workers during the off-season. Respondents, government and private companies, demurred to the complaint. The court sustained the demurrers and dismissed petitioners' action. The Declaratory Judgment Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7541(c), provided jurisdiction as constitutional claims were raised, but not over respondent private companies that did not employ petitioners. The court held that U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 32, were not violated as the classification of seasonal workers was rationally related to a legitimate state end. Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 1 was not violated as public was put on notice as to the intent of &sect; 802.5 during the legislative process. Petitioners' procedural due process rights were not violated by &sect; 802.5 failing to provide for notice of an employer's seasonal determination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer filed exceptions to a decision of the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, which rejected petitioner's contention that the assessment of sales tax upon certain food items dispensed by vending machine was unconstitutional. Petition argued that identical items were not taxed when purchased in a convenience store. Petitioner also challenged the court's order upholding respondent commonwealth's method of computing sales tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Considering objections filed by petitioner taxpayer, the court affirmed its prior ruling that petitioner did not meet its burden of proving that the assessment of sales tax on its retail sales pursuant to 72 P.S. &sect; 7202(d)(1971) and 72 P.S. &sect; 7204(29)(1971) was unconstitutional. Petitioner made a constitutional argument based on the imposition of sales tax on items it sold from vending machines that were identical to items not taxed sold in stores. The court held that petitioner's provision of microwave ovens and tables and chairs at certain locations permitted the categorization of petitioner's vending machines as an &quot;other eating place&quot; under 72 P.S. &sect; 7204. The court found that in its merchandising and consumer base, petitioner's sales were distinguishable from those of a store so as to justify a distinctive tax burden. The court reversed its decision as to respondent commonwealth's method of calculating sales tax, invalidating 61 Pa. Code &sect; 31.28 to the extent that it imposed tax on gross receipts collected from any machine. The court found that petitioner met its burden of proving that respondent's method of calculating sales tax imposed double taxation.</SPAN></P>

The system later notified petitioner that he was not entitled to purchase a service credit because he was eligible to receive a retirement benefit for his military service in the form of a federal civil service pension. Petitioner appealed the determination of the Pennsylvania Public School Employees' Retirement Board that he was not entitled to the service credit. The court affirmed the board's decision and held that because credit for military service in the system was a benefit which the commonwealth need not have offered, it was a legitimate state interest to limit that benefit to individuals who could not otherwise receive a benefit for their military service. The court further held that it was not irrational for the general assembly to enact the restriction and that it was not violative of any substantive due process or equal protection rights petitioner might have had.</SPAN></P>

Respondent condominiums claimed an exemption for residential use and refused to pay sales taxes while they awaited the outcome of litigation against respondent state. Petitioner filed an action seeking a declaration that the prepayment provision of the Act was unconstitutional, and an order for respondent condominiums to reimburse it for taxes paid on their behalf. Petitioner then filed a motion for summary judgment. The court denied petitioner's motion and entered judgment for respondents because petitioner failed to establish any tax liability on the part of respondent condominiums. Respondent condominiums never legally owed the sales taxes at issue, so petitioner made an &quot;overpayment&quot; and could be entitled to a refund with interest. The court found that public utilities, by virtue of being the only state regulated monopolies, had a variety of benefits not available to other business utilities, so the requirement that they prepay taxes to non-residential customers is just and reasonable.</SPAN></P>

A warrant was issued for petitioner as a technical parole violator and he was recommitted to serve 15 months backtime. On appeal, the court affirmed and found that it was not difficult to arrive at a sure and workable meaning as to what &quot;do not associate with minors&quot; meant in the context of a convicted sex offender. The court concluded that the term &quot;associate&quot; was an ordinary term used to express ideas which found adequate interpretation in common usage and understanding, and therefore satisfied the constitutional requirement of reasonable certainty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order recommitting petitioner for violation of special condition of parole. The court found that the special condition was not vague because the term &quot;associate&quot; had a common usage and understanding, and thus satisfied the constitutional requirement of reasonable certainty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee township authority passed a resolution authorizing the construction of a sanitary sewer system along the street where appellant property owner's two tracts of land were located.

The trial court found the sewer assessments valid and proper, and denied appellant's motions for post-trial relief. Appellant challenged the trial court's judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed. Appellee liens were not time-barred even though appellee filed the liens some nine years after construction of the sewer project was completed. Pursuant to 53 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7432, there are no time limitations on the filing of municipal claims. The court rejected appellant's argument that the imposition of liens on her property pursuant to the validation statute was unconstitutional and deprived her of due process. Also, the court held that appellant failed to rebut the presumption that the sewer line benefitted her property. Finally, as substantial evidence showed that appellant's property was urban in character, assessment by the front-foot method was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant church challenged the trial court's order permanently enjoining defendant from interfering with plaintiff synod's use of local church property. Defendant pastor and church council had a serious doctrinal dispute with plaintiff, resulting in plaintiff's removal of the pastor under church by-laws. Church council members transferred money from defendant's bank account into their personal accounts and had to be forcibly removed from the church by the sheriff. When council members refused to obey the preliminary injunction, they were held in contempt and jailed. On appeal, the court held that defendant council members were not denied their right to a speedy trial because the contempt order was civil in nature and could be purged by obeying the preliminary injunction. As long as plaintiff had followed its own internal rules, the trial court had jurisdiction to adjudicate under U.S. Const. amend. I because the parties' property dispute was contractual in nature. The court vacated the permanent injunction and remanded for determination of whether plaintiff had followed its own rules prior to the injunction's being made permanent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought review of an order from the Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board (Pennsylvania) which had been modified on remand for a determination of dependency benefits. The court granted reargument of the matter, limited to the issue of whether, pursuant decisional case law, claimant mother's benefits should have terminated when her child reached the age of 18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue on reargument was whether claimant mother's dependency benefits should terminate when her child reached the age of 18. It had previously been determined by the court that claimant, whose son was killed by a co-employee, had established the requisite dependency to be entitled to benefits under the Pennsylvania Workmen's Compensation Act (Act), 77 P.S. &sect; 561(5). Because claimant was obligated to support her minor children, the amount of the decedent's contribution attributable to the minor sister's college tuition was a necessity of life, but only until the decedent's sister reached the age of 18 years. Here, the court reversed the order of the workmen's compensation board and remanded the case for computation of benefits for dependency from the time of decedent's death until claimant's minor child's 18th birthday, under 77 P.S. &sect; 562, because the determination of dependency, subject to a subsequent condition, comported with the overall objective of the Act, which was to compensate persons who were actually dependent to some extent upon a deceased worker whose death was work-related.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the order of the workmen's compensation board because claimant mother's argument that statutory silence as to any durational limit compelled the interpretation that dependent parents were entitled to benefits until they died was rejected. The court found that claimant's dependency existed on account of the educational expenses of decedent's minor sister, and that the obligation terminated when the child reached 18.</SPAN></P>

The court ordered respondent governor removed from the suit because respondent governor was not the appropriate party. Respondent secretary was removed because this cause of action was not concerned with a state taxing statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hospital sought relief from an order of the State Health Facility Hearing Board (Pennsylvania), upholding the Pennsylvania Department of Health's determination that the psychiatric hospitals proposed by appellant were subject to certificate-of-need review pursuant to 35 P.S. &sect; 448.101 of the Health Care Facilities Act. Appellant asserted that its projects were excluded from certificate-of-need review under 35 PS. &sect; 448.103.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Proposing a hospital project which accepted no federal or state funds, appellant hospital requested a non-reviewability determination pursuant to 35 P.S. &sect; 446.103. On appeal, the court held that under the amended language of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 300m-2, the self-destructing clause of &sect; 446.103 was triggered when the exclusionary provision became inconsistent with the federal regulations established by the federal Secretary of Health and Human Services. Accordingly, respondent correctly wrote its regulations treating the exclusionary provision as if it had no effect, and its determination that appellant's proposed hospital projects were subject to certificate-of-need review was proper and in accord with both state and federal statute and regulations. Determining that the delegation in &sect; 446.103 fit the definition of a status-finding type statute, the court held that the statute did not unlawfully delegate state legislative authority to the federal Secretary in violation of Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 1, but merely requested a determination of whether the exclusionary provision conformed to the established federal program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decision of the State Health Facility Hearing Board holding that projects proposed by appellant hospital were subject to certificate-of-need review under the Health Care Facilities Act was affirmed as the statutory exclusion provision was void as being inconsistent with federal guidelines and the requirement that the statute conform to the federal program was not an unconstitutional delegation of law-making.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police officer sought review of a decision from the Court of Common Pleas of Blair County (Pennsylvania), which dismissed his appeal from a determination by appellee city's council to remove him from his position. Appellant contended that the mayor's dual roles as the one who preferred the charges against appellant and who also chaired the council hearing that resulted in appellant's dismissal violated appellant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police officer had charges of misconduct preferred against him by the mayor of appellee city, pursuant to the authority conferred by 53 P.S. &sect; 36103. Thereafter the mayor, in accordance with &sect; 36103, sat as a member of appellee's council that conducted the hearing resulting in appellant's dismissal. The trial court dismissed the appeal, and appellant sought further review, contending that an impermissible commingling of the prosecutorial and adjudicatory functions of the mayor resulted in a violation of appellant's due process rights. The court reversed the decision and remanded the cause for a new hearing before appellee's council without the participation of the mayor. The court found that, while the statutory scheme established the potential for a due process violation because of the commingling of the mayor's prosecutorial and adjudicatory functions, the statutes did not require the mayor to sit in the adjudication of the charges but required only that he be the one who preferred the charges. The court concluded that the mayor should have recused himself from the due process hearing and that his failure to do so violated appellant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners filed complaints challenging those bond issues as invalid, which respondent department (department) dismissed. On review, the court held that the Local Government Unit Debt Act &sect; 202, 53 P.S. &sect; 6780-52, was controlling with regard to the appropriate limits of the district's non-electoral debt. Pursuant to the limits set by 53 P.S. &sect; 6780-52, the district could properly increase its debt in the proposed amounts without first seeking the approval of the electorate. Thus, petitioners' challenge to the district's proposed increase in non-electoral bonded indebtedness was properly rejected by the department. The court also held that the department's procedure was proper and in accord with applicable rules, and given the district's admission of all material facts alleged by petitioners, evidentiary hearings were not in order; petitioners' procedural challenge was thus rejected. The court also held that the renovation of an elementary school was clearly a legitimate purpose underlying the district's decision to issue the bonds. The orders of the department were thus affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Particularly, petitioners claimed that the statutes impinge upon their constitutional rights to own gamecocks and to associate with members of organizations in other states where cock fighting was legal. The court dismissed the petition on the commonwealth's preliminary objections. The court ruled that there was no allegation that any members of the association had been prosecuted or threatened with prosecution under the statute in question. Therefore, the court ruled, the events that would have given rise to a case or controversy had not occurred and may never occur. A declaratory judgment based upon such remote speculation that prosecution may occur in the future, the court ruled, was premature.

Appellee was found guilty and his appeal was dismissed. After reconsideration, the trial court reversed its decision and held that the evidence had to be suppressed, and arrested the judgment. The court reversed the order and remanded for imposition of sentence because the agent entered the property in reliance on provisions which at the time were presumed to be constitutional.

Appellees cross-appealed an order that lowered the assessment. Appellants contended that no liabilities for penalties should have attached. The court held that 72 P.S. &sect;5452.17 was clear and unambiguous. The court reasoned that it required a taxpayer, in order to avoid possible liability, to pay the original assessed amount. The court also held that the order became final when no one appealed. Appellants claimed that their reliance upon an order of the trial court as well as their good faith, as evidenced by both their tender and their payment into court, relieved them of any liability for penalties. The court held that the proper method would have been to pay the tax under protest and to seek a refund. The court concluded that it did not believe that reliance upon the order was a valid justification to avoid the payment of penalties. The court also held that no compound interest needed to be paid and that appellants failed to support their burden that the interest rate was unconstitutional. The orders were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, automobile dealers and their trade associations, filed a declaratory judgment action seeking to have the Philadelphia Mercantile License Tax (MLT) declared unconstitutional as violative of Pa.

Appellees opposed the motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, asserting that the constitutionality issue was moot because the MLT had been repealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the summary judgment in appellees' favor. The court found that to afford appellants relief, the trial court would have had to declare an already repealed statute to be unconstitutional, giving that decision retroactive application in order to award a refund of taxes paid. The court held that retroactive relief was discretionary and based upon the exigencies of each case. The court concluded that the trial court had not abused its discretion, in refusing appellants' request for a tax refund, because the monies in question had long since been expended on city services, and a refund would cause severe financial hardship.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner township supervisor voted for his own appointment as secretary/treasurer of the township and received compensation for that position.

Second Class Township Code, 53 P.S. &sect; 65101 - 66981, provided that township supervisors could appoint themselves as roadmaster, secretary, and treasurer, but that the township auditors had to set the compensation, pursuant to 53 P.S. &sect;&sect; 65515 and 65531.

Stat. &sect; 307. Petitioner was discharged by respondent Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission after it was discovered that he was the part-time employee of a regulated carrier. The court upheld his dismissal under 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 301(b), because his outside employment created a conflict of interest and was incompatible with his work for respondent. The court rejected petitioner's argument that &sect; 301(b) was unconstitutionally void for vagueness because the term, &quot;incompatible,&quot; as usually defined, gave a person of reasonable intelligence fair notice that his conduct would violate &sect; 301(b), particularly where that conduct created a conflict of interest. The court found that the application of &sect; 301(b) to petitioner was not unconstitutional because the evidence established that he was on notice that his employment with the regulated carrier was prohibited.

The letter concluded that failure of appellant to immediately submit a letter of resignation from the City Board of Education to the Superintendent's office, would leave him no choice but to terminate appellant. Appellant's attorney responded to the letter. The Superintendent found appellant's response unsatisfactory and therefore, terminated appellant. Both the Civil Service Commission and trial court sustained her discharge. Appellant's major contention on appeal was that the Superintendent's failure to afford her a full hearing before her discharge violated her constitutional right to due process.

When respondents did not request from the legislature a budget that included such set amount per employee, petitioners filed the petition for review seeking a declaratory judgment as to the existence and amount of the reserve account and an injunction requiring respondents to request appropriation of surplus funds to fund the debt of the reserve account. Respondents filed numerous preliminary objections. In overruling in part, the court held that jurisdiction did not lie with the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board where petitioners alleged a refusal to implement contract terms and that petitioners had standing to bring suit on their members' behalf. In sustaining in part, it held that it lacked jurisdiction to interpret the contract and that immunity prevented it from requiring respondents to allocate funds to the reserve account.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorneys filed a complaint in the court of common pleas seeking declaratory relief upon their contention that certain provisions of the Philadelphia Code that imposed business and mercantile taxes and licenses were unconstitutional as applied to attorneys. The court of common pleas denied such relief on the ground that appellants had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. On review, the court reversed the lower court and remanded for further proceedings. The court noted that appellants were challenging the constitutionality of the tax and licensing enabling legislation. The court found that administrative agencies did not possess the authority to pass upon the validity and constitutionality of acts of the general assembly. Thus, the court concluded that the City's Board of License and Inspection Review and the Tax Review Board could not grant appellants the relief sought. The court ruled, therefore, that the existence of administrative remedies in the challenged ordinances did not deprive a court of its equity jurisdiction to entertain constitutional challenges to the statute itself through a declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the Act did not contain internally inconsistent requirements for obtaining mortgage assistance as a claimant could satisfy the delinquency requirements and the eligibility requirements by demonstrating a sound income history.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Lawrence County (Pennsylvania), which affirmed a decision of appellee Board of Supervisors, denying appellants' request that it declare relevant portions of its zoning ordinance invalid and adopt appellants' proposed curative amendment. Appellants argued that the ordinance was invalid and that they therefore had a right to strip mine on the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners leased the right to remove, by strip mining process, coal on their property. The property was zoned for residential use and the local zoning ordinance prohibited surface mining in residential areas. Appellants filed a request for a curative amendment. Appellee board of supervisors refused to grant the curative amendment and the trial court upheld that decision. Appellants insisted that the ordinance was invalid because it did not contain a statement of objectives, regulated surface mining, totally excluded strip mining, and argued that they had a right to strip mine on the property. On appeal, the court vacated the decision of the trial court, holding that the lack of a statement of community objectives did not render the local ordinance invalid. The court stated that there was ample evidence to support appellee's findings that to permit strip mining in the residential zone would be detrimental to the public's health, safety, and general welfare. The court remanded for determination whether the ordinance prevented appellants from gaining access the their subsurface property, thus rendering the ordinance invalid as a taking without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded for additional evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court remanded for disposition of defendant commonwealth's motion for judgment on the pleadings. Before the court were plaintiff's claims against defendants, commonwealth, and secretary, for violation of plaintiff's constitutional rights, and wrongful discharge. Claims against defendant union for resolution included breach of duty of fair representation, and discrimination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand following appeal, the court was directed to render a decision on defendant commonwealth's motion for judgment on the pleadings. Plaintiff's petition against defendants, commonwealth, secretary, and labor union, alleged that petitioner's supervisor, on more than one occasion, urged her to purchase a ticket to a fundraiser sponsored by a political party After plaintiff refused to purchase a ticket, defendants, commonwealth and secretary, terminated her employment. Plaintiff further alleged that defendant union breached its duty of fair representation. The court held plaintiff's complaint did not support a cause of action against defendant commonwealth under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Further, sovereign immunity precluded her suit against defendant commonwealth on plaintiff's claims of violation of her federal and state constitutional rights and wrongful discharge. Therefore judgment on the pleadings in favor of defendant commonwealth was granted. The court denied defendant secretary's motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding that an evidentiary hearing was required to determine the applicability of defendant secretary's qualified official immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant commonwealth's motion for judgment on the pleadings finding defendant commonwealth was not a proper defendant in a violation of civil rights action, and because the legislature had not waived sovereign immunity for claims of wrongful discharge. The court denied the motion in regards to defendant secretary because an evidentiary hearing was needed to determine whether defendant secretary had qualified immunity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner oil producers' organization filed a motion for summary judgment in the declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of the 1984 Oil and Gas Act (Act), 58 P.S. &sect;&sect; 601.101-601.605. The court found that petitioner did not establish that any of the seven provisions of the Act cited were unconstitutional. The alleged presumption-shifting effect of 58 P.S. &sect; 601.208(c) was too speculative to be considered, bond requirements were held not to violate the Equal Protection Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, and prehearing property seizure provisions were presumed to be constitutional. The court found that petitioner did not show that entry and inspection provisions of the Act violated U.S. Const. amend. IV protections, or that reporting requirements violated rights to privacy or rights against self-incrimination under U.S. Const. amend. V. The court also held that the Act contained definite and reasonable standards for criminal enforcement of violation of the provisions, and that no unlawful commingling of legislative, judicial, and prosecutorial functions existed under the Act. The court denied the motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner insurance agent sought review of an order by the Acting Insurance Commissioner (Pennsylvania) that suspended petitioner's license, required petitioner, among other things, to cease and desist from denying access to his business records by insurance department investigators and to pay a $ 1,000 civil penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two insurance investigators' visited petitioner insurance agent and requested inspection of certain records. The inspectors had not obtained a subpoena or search warrant and were not acting on any specific complaint regarding petitioner. Petitioner refused to grant access to the records. On a subsequent visit, petitioner offered the investigator's access to two boxes of records. The investigators declined to review these records based on their opinion that the files contained only a portion of the requested records. The court reversed the order by the commissioner because it was determined that the investigator's attempted a warrantless search of petitioner's insurance records and this was not specifically authorized by Unfair Insurance Practices Act, 40 P.S. &sect; 1171.7. The court found no indication that the legislature had granted the investigator's a right to enter insurance business without a warrant or subpoena. The court found that the required records doctrine with regards to business records holds no privilege against warrantless searches. However, the scope of the search against petitioner was clearly not limited to its required records detailed in 31 Pa. Code &sect; 33.29(d).</SPAN></P>

The court held that the apportionment plan did not meet the requirement of contiguity as required by &sect; 502 because there were breaks in the physical territory sought to be annexed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a township, a taxpayer on behalf of all other township taxpayers, and a minor on behalf of all other school aged children in the township, filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking a declaration that specific provisions of the Pennsylvania Public School Code of 1949 relating to the funding of the commonwealth's public schools were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners filed with the court, in its original jurisdiction, a petition for review in the nature of an action for declaratory and equitable relief against respondents (the commonwealth, the state treasurer, and the state's secretary of education), alleging that the statutory scheme for the funding of the state's public schools under the Pennsylvania Public School Code of 1949 (Code), 24 P.S. &sect;&sect; 25-2502.5 and 25-2502.6, violated both the federal and state constitutions. Petitioners also sought to enjoin the distribution of subsidies to school districts. Petitioners eventually filed a motion for summary judgment. The court found that respondents' concern for maintaining an equitable distribution of the commonwealth's limited resources provided a rational basis for the Code provisions. As such, the court concluded that the provisions bore a reasonable relation to a constitutional mandate by the legislature to provide for a thorough and efficient public school system. As petitioners had not proven that the Code's funding scheme clearly, palpably, and plainly violated the Constitution, the court upheld the challenged sections and denied petitioners' motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court found that a rational basis for such provisions, and their statutory scheme for the funding of state public schools bore a reasonable relation to a constitutional mandate by the legislature to provide for an effective and efficient public school system.</SPAN></P>
