</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A criminal defendant was administered a preliminary breath test, arrested for driving under the influence, and taken to a hospital for a blood test. At a suppression hearing, plaintiff prosecution stated that it never raised breath test evidence at trial. Yet, during trial testimony was admitted that defendant had consented to such a test. Then, during deliberations the jury sent out a question asking whether a breath test was administered and for the results. Defendant was found guilty and appealed. The court held that since defendant conceded that the officer had probable cause to arrest him, the result of the breath test was inadmissible under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 39-20-14. Therefore, evidence that defendant consented to take such a test was irrelevant and improperly admitted. However, the erroneous admission was not prejudicial. Because defendant failed to submit a full transcript of the proceeding, including the trial court's response to the jury question, the court was unable to determine whether the irrelevant evidence changed the final result. Therefore, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

While the admission of the irrelevant evidence that defendant consented to a blood test was improper, the court was unable to determine from the record submitted whether that evidence changed the final result and the result of the blood test alone supported the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the North Dakota Workers' Compensation Bureau, sought review of a District Court of Ramsey County (North Dakota) decision that appellee, injured employee, should not have had his permanent partial injury (PPI) award calculated under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 65-05-12.2, which had been enacted in 1996. Court held appellee's rights had vested and &sect;&sect; 65-05-12 and 13, statutes in effect on date of injury, should have been applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1987, appellee was injured while working for appellant employer and appellant North Dakota Workers' Compensation Bureau (Bureau) provided appellee with total disability benefits. In 1997, appellee was evaluated for a permanent partial injury award (PPI) and appellant Bureau, applying N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 65-05-12.2, effective in 1996, determined his award. District court reversed, holding appellee's PPI award should have been calculated under &sect;&sect; 65-05-12 and -13, statutes that had been in effect before 1996, because appellee's rights vested on the date of his injury. Appellate court reversed and reinstated appellant Bureau's determination. Legislature specifically provided the new law would apply to all PPI awards determined after effective date, regardless of the date of injury. Moreover, such a statutory enactment could operate retrospectively because any right to PPI benefits did not vest on the date of injury, but on the date the impairment was determined to be permanent and such awards were not contractual, but statutory. In addition, appellant Bureau properly evaluated award under American Medical Association Guides in effect on date of statutory enactments.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 65-05-12.2 reversed. Statute applied to all PPI awards determined after effective date and operated retrospectively because rights to PPI benefits vested on date impairment determined to be permanent and such awards were not contractual.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to sexual imposition and was required to register as a sexual offender. He registered with the police where he was convicted, but failed to notify them when he moved. He appealed the conviction for this misdemeanor, arguing that the case should have been dismissed because he pled guilty to a sexual offense prior to the enactment of the statute requiring registration for past convictions. Defendant claimed that the registration requirement was unconstitutional because its retroactivity was ex post facto punishment. In affirming the decision, the court concluded that the registration requirement was regulatory, not punitive, and was designed to aid law enforcement agencies. The purpose of the registration requirement was protection of a legitimate public interest, which imposed a collateral consequence upon conviction, not added punishment. Thus, it did not violate the ex post facto clauses of the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother appealed from the order of the District Court of Burleigh County (North Dakota), which granted plaintiff's request to move with her child to another state, denied plaintiff's motion for termination of visitation rights of defendants, the child's paternal grandparents, and granted defendants visitation for one month each summer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After plaintiff mother and her child's father were determined to be unfit parents, custody of the child was awarded to defendants, the child's paternal grandparents. Plaintiff later moved for custody and was granted extended weekend visitation. Following the extended visitation period, the trial court granted plaintiff sole custody and awarded defendants visitation one weekend each month, with the child's father to have concurrent visitation. Plaintiff moved to terminate defendants' visitation and requested permission to move to another state. The trial court granted plaintiff's request to move, but awarded defendants visitation during one month each summer. The court affirmed. A natural parent's right to a child's custody was not absolute. Defendants had been the child's psychological parents during his early life. The trial court's order also facilitated visitation between the child and his father because the father's visitation occurred in conjunction with defendants' visitation. Finally, considering the distance between defendants' home and where plaintiff intended to move, extended visitation during the summer was the only feasible way to facilitate visitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order granting defendants visitation for one month each summer. The record demonstrated that defendants were the child's psychological parents during his early life because they had been the child's custodial parents for two years after a court had found plaintiff to be an unfit parent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff grandparents sued defendant mother to obtain visitation with their grandchild. The district court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint after finding that the grandparent visitation statute,&nbsp;N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 14-09-05.1 (1993), was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the finding of unconstitutionality, but reversed the dismissal and remanded for further proceedings pursuant to the former version of the statute. The court held that the statute was unconstitutional to the extent it required courts to grant grandparents visitation rights with an unmarried minor unless visitation was found not to be in the child's best interests and presumed visitation rights of grandparents were in a child's best interests. The court determined that the statute violated parents' fundamental liberty interests in controlling the persons with whom their children associated, which was protected by the due process clause of the state and federal constitutions. The court found that there was no compelling state interest justifying such a burden on parents' fundamental rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the portion of the order declaring the statutory amendment creating a presumption and requiring grandparental visitation unless such visitation was not in the best interest of the child, because the statute violated parents' fundamental liberty interests in controlling the persons with whom their children associated. The court reversed the dismissal and remanded for further proceedings under the former version of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant resident purchased a home in appellee city and began receiving water and sewer service therefrom. Appellant protested the monthly garbage fee, stating that he wished to handle his own garbage removal. When appellant refused to pay his delinquent garbage fees, appellee shut off his water. He filed an action in small claims court that the court later dismissed without prejudice on appellant's motion. Appellee moved for summary judgment on its counterclaim for unpaid garbage fees and a water connection fee. The lower court entered judgment against appellant for the fees, plus statutory costs and interest. Appellant sought review. Collection and disposal of waste fell within a municipality's police power to protect public health, safety, and welfare. Appellant was a member of the public whose health and safety was protected by the garbage collection service. Appellant and his property were served by the service. He could have properly been charged for its maintenance. The ordinance that provided for mandatory garbage removal service for all residents did not exceed appellee's authority under N.D. Cent. Code &sect;&sect; 40-05-01.1 and 40-34-05. Nor did it violate due process. Affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insured appealed a decision from the District Court of Burleigh County, South Central Judicial District (North Dakota), which awarded summary judgment to defendant insurer and held that plaintiff's claims for economic damages and underinsured benefits were to be apportioned according to the parties' fault in the underlying motor vehicle accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the plain language of the modified comparative fault statute,&nbsp;N.D. Cent. Code &sect;32-03.2-02, required allocation of fault and damages to &quot;persons.&quot; The court further found that plaintiff's duty to mitigate damages did not evidence defendant tortfeasor's adoption of plaintiff's doctors' negligence. The court affirmed the apportionment of plaintiff's underinsured benefits according to the parties' fault, finding that N.D Cent. Code &sect;32-03.2-02 did not violate substantive due process where it was reasonably related to the legislature's legitimate governmental interest in apportioning liability amount those responsible for a victim's injuries and damages. However, the court reversed that part of the decision that ordered the apportionment of plaintiff's economic damages and held that defendant insurer was obligated to pay all of such damages under its no-fault policy, noting that under N.D. Cent. Code &sect;26.1-41-06, &quot;bodily injury arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle&quot; was construed to extend basic no-fault coverage to persons who received negligent medical treatment for personal injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision which apportioned plaintiff insured's claim for non-economic damages, finding that plaintiff was not entitled to recover benefits for its own doctors' negligence where the state's modified comparative fault statutes required allocation of fault and damages; decision on economic damages reversed because defendant insurer's liability under its no-fault policy included damages from doctors' negligence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied appellant prisoner's request for an order appointing a private attorney to prosecute appellant's wife for adultery and cohabitation after the state attorney refused to do so. The court concluded that an order under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 11-16-06 refusing to appoint a private attorney to initiate a criminal prosecution was not appealable. The court also refused to exercise its discretion to issue a supervisory writ. Limited prosecutory and investigatory resources, a bulging caseload, the dubious nature of appellant's marriage, and the probability of not obtaining a conviction supported the state attorney's discretionary decision not to initiate proceedings and the trial court's decision not to appoint a private attorney. The criteria for the exercise of original jurisdiction to issue a prerogative writ were not satisfied because the matter was not of public importance or in the public interest and the court's original jurisdiction could not be invoked in a matter of private rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that, for the purpose of appeal, deferring imposition of sentence complied with the requirements of N.D. R. Crim. P. 32(b). Therefore, the court had jurisdiction to review the lower court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress evidence after he was convicted of possessing marijuana and a controlled substance. None of the facts presented to the lower court demonstrated the probability that easily destroyed evidence would be destroyed without a no-knock warrant. An officer had to present a particularized basis for the suspicion that drugs would be disposed of or destroyed if their presence was announced to dispense with the knock-and-announce requirement. However, the court concluded that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied, and the evidence obtained from the illegal search was admissible. Indicia of probable cause was supplied by prior cases in which a no-knock warrant was issued on a per se basis by a court under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 19-03.1-32(3).</SPAN></P>

At trial, the complainant testified about her deposition testimony and about her having had sexual intercourse with a young man.

Defendant also sought to examine the young man about his sexual acts with complainant and made an offer of proof. Defendant was convicted of six counts of gross sexual imposition in violation of N.D.

The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding additional evidence of sexual activity by the complainant, in excluding evidence about statements the complainant might have made to the young man, or in declining to poll the jury.

Defendants prevailed below based on the argument that plaintiff's failure to give written notice of the claim deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction. The court affirmed dismissal, concluding N.D. Cent.

The court explained that actual notice was insufficient to satisfy a written notice requirement. The court concluded that the lower court therefore correctly determined it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.

The court sustained the convictions, holding that the officers acted in good faith when obtaining and executing the search warrant because at the time it was authorized and executed, it was legal in North Dakota to issue no-knock search warrants in all cases where drugs were involved. N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 19-03.1-32(3) required that a law enforcement officer have probable cause in suspecting evidence may be destroyed or that the officer may be in danger if he or she knocked and announced their presence before entering in order to justify a no-knock warrant.

The Bureau awarded her benefits under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 65-05.1 with limitations. The trial court affirmed the Bureau's decision, and the employee sought review contending that such limitations violated the equal protection clause. The court held that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 65-05.1-01(3) defined substantial gainful employment as bona fide work for remuneration as near as possible to the employee's average weekly earnings at the time of the injury, or 75 percent of the average weekly wage in the state, whichever was less. The court determined that the statute was not violative of the equal protection clause. The court found that the income classification was rationally related to legitimate government purposes and did not unconstitutionally discriminate against higher wage workers. The court further determined that the rational basis standard of review was the appropriate classification and found that, since the legislature had an identifiable purpose for adopting the classification, such classification was constitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was admitted at the state hospital. The doctor diagnosed his condition as schizophrenia. The trial court concluded that the patient suffered from a mental illness that substantially impaired his capacity to use self-control. It authorized continued treatment and found that alternative treatment was not appropriate. On appeal, the doctor argued that the patient's appeal was not timely. The court concluded that it had jurisdiction. Because the case was also a civil action, the trial court could properly extend the time for filing the notice of appeal for a period not to exceed 90 days after service of notice of entry of order. The notice of appeal was filed within 90 days of the patient's receiving actual notice. The court concluded that it was not clearly erroneous for the trial court to order continuing treatment for the patient based on his past record of violent assaultive behavior, coupled with the current and uncontroverted expert opinion that his behavior would revert if the prescribed treatment did not continue. The patient had become violent when not taking his medications, and he refused to acknowledge his illness.</SPAN></P>

The court found that treating an application as incomplete if it lacked a sheriff's approval allowed a sheriff to decide who could or could not be licensed. The court concluded that the legislature did not intend N. D. Cent. Code &sect; 62.1-04-03 to give sheriffs discretionary authority to deny licenses. The court reasoned that any discretion given to the county sheriff under &sect; 62.1-04-03 was symbolic at best, as the statute set forth no grounds, other than the &quot;testing procedure.&quot; Thus, the court ruled that the sheriff must approve an application within a reasonable time, unless the applicant objectively failed the &quot;testing procedure&quot; specified in &sect; 62.1-04-03 (1)(c).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's vehicle was stopped at a game-and-fish checkpoint. The game warden ascertained defendant had not been hunting, but noticed two open cans of beer in the vehicle. After telling defendant to wait, the warden called over the police chief, who was standing about 25 feet away. Thereafter, defendant was arrested for driving under suspension and driving while impaired. Defendant filed a motion to suppress all evidence obtained while stopped at the checkpoint. The trial court granted defendant's motion. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that, weighing the State's compelling interest in preserving its wildlife, the effectiveness of the check point used to advance that interest, and the minimal level of intrusiveness, the checkpoint was constitutional. Further, when police officers and game wardens worked as a &quot;team&quot; on a game-and-fish checkpoint, a reasonable construction of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 20.1-02-15.1 permitted the implication of a request from team officers for aid and assistance on non-wildlife offenses discovered during checkpoint activities. Thus, the warden had the &quot;team&quot; power of a police officer to briefly detain defendant after seeing the open beer cans.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on marijuana seeds, stems, residue, and a note describing how to grow marijuana found in defendant's garbage cans, officers obtained a no-knock warrant to search defendant's home. Upon execution of the warrant, the officers found marijuana, seeds, equipment and a book used for indoor growing, and drug paraphernalia. Defendant argued that the search of his garbage cans and the issuance of the no-knock warrant violated his right against unreasonable search and seizure. The court found that defendant had no objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the garbage cans, which had clearly been placed out for collection. Further, the issuing magistrate's question to the officer of whether she wanted a no-knock warrant did not show that the magistrate was biased. The court also found that there was probable cause to issue the warrant. However, the court reversed the conviction because the officer did not meet her burden of demonstrating the need for a no-knock warrant. Her fear that defendant would dispose of the evidence was insufficient. To the extent the court had previously authorized a per se rule authorizing no-knock warrants in drug cases, such law was overruled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The probationers were serving sentences of probation when &sect; 54-23.3-04(16) was enacted. The statute required that when probation was imposed, supervision costs and fees of not less than $ 30 per month were to be imposed unless imposition would result in an undue hardship. Shortly after the statute took effect, the officials ordered the probationers to begin paying the monthly supervision fees. The probationers claimed that the statute was improperly being applied retroactively, violated due process, and was an unconstitutional delegation of judicial powers. The complaint was dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Affirming, the court held that the collection of the supervision fees did not constitute retroactive application of the statute or an unconstitutional delegation of judicial power because the statute created a civil fee for services, not new conditions of probation. The court also held that the statute was not constitutionally invalid on its face because it envisioned a process for consideration of a probationer's ability to pay the assessed fee and an opportunity for a judicial determination.</SPAN></P>

The sheriff searched the car and found a shotgun and drug pipe. As the car was being searched, defendant remained outside the bar, without being told to do so. Defendant was not handcuffed, read his Miranda rights, or arrested during the search. Later that day, defendant, without being asked, went to the sheriff's office and volunteered information about the items found in the car. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying a motion to suppress because he was in a custodial situation when the sheriff escorted him out of the bar to serve the warrant. The court affirmed the convictions, holding that the trial court did not err in its denial of the motion to suppress because defendant was never in custody, let alone involved in an interrogation. The court also found that defendant's statements and confessions to the sheriff outside of a custodial setting were voluntarily made. The court also held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow testimony as to the mistake-of-law defense because N.D. Cent.

The business filed for declaratory relief and the trial court granted it summary judgment. Both sides appealed. The court affirmed the judgment below, ruling that the failure of the business to exhaust administrative remedies did not preclude a declaratory judgment action. The exhaustion doctrine did not apply when the legal question was one of statutory interpretation and the agency's expertise was not needed to make a factual decision. The interpretation of a statute such as &sect; 43-15-35 was a question of law that was fully reviewable by a court. The court ruled that &sect; 43-15-35 clearly and unambiguously described two exemptions to the pharmacist-ownership requirements, and neither was limited to retail pharmacies. There was only one type of permit, and the business was exempt under &sect; 43-15-35. The court also affirmed the denial of attorneys' fees to the business.</SPAN></P>

The trial court joined the father as a defendant and expanded the grandparents' visitation. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the trial court's visitation order was clearly erroneous because no party had requested that visitation be expanded and because it imposed substantial visitation that clearly interfered with parental choices such as the father's work schedule, time for family activities, the reunion of the family, and enrolling their child in weekend activities with other children.

The trial court declared the statute unconstitutional because it improperly limited the State's discovery in its prosecution of defendant for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Affirming, the court found that under N.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 3, a procedural rule adopted by the court prevailed in a conflict with a statutory procedural rule. N.D. Cent.

The defense witness disclosure provisions of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 29-01-32 formed the centerpiece of the statute.

The lower court ruled in favor of the city, holding that the taking was necessary and awarded the companies &quot;fair and just compensation&quot; for the taking. The court concluded that the city did not abuse its discretion in finding the taking of the disputed property is necessary in the interests of the public economy, health and welfare of its residents. However, because the lower court did not decide whether the primary object of the development project was for the economic welfare of the city and its residents rather than for the primary benefit of private interests, the court reversed the judgment granting the city rights to the disputed property and remanded to the trial court to make that required finding. The court also concluded that the lower court had no authority in the eminent domain proceeding to order the companies to pay the fees and expenses of the city's expert appraiser, and reversed that judgment.</SPAN></P>

When he was leaving he screamed, &quot;The public needs to know that you have doctors that murder people.&quot; Defendant was charged with disorderly conduct. He represented himself and was found guilty by a jury. He filed the present appeal, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to convict him and that the disorderly conduct statute was unconstitutionally applied. The court found that neither issue was preserved for review and affirmed the conviction. Defendant was required to file a motion for judgment of acquittal under Rule 29 of the North Dakota Rules of Criminal Procedure before the jury returned with its verdict in order to preserve the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence for review. Further, the court declined to review the constitutional issue because defendant failed to raise the issue in the trial court, and the case was not exceptional and did not involve obvious, serious injustice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens owned agricultural land adjacent to a 100-acre tract on which the purchaser held an option to buy. The City adopted a resolution to annex the tract and the citizens filed a written protest. The City postponed action on the resolution and the related zoning amendment and approved a loan to the intervenor to buy the land. The citizens and others filed an action to enjoin the annexation resolution and the trial court granted a temporary restraining order. The intervenor bought the land and petitioned for annexation. The City Council defeated the annexation resolution but accepted the intervenor's petition. The trial court dissolved the restraining order and granted summary judgment dismissing the citizens' action. The citizens appealed. The court noted that the Act diagrammed the procedures for a municipality to annex land, and found that it provided for annexation by resolution and by petition from a landowner. The court held that nothing in the Act precluded a municipality from defeating its annexation resolution without submitting it to a review commission and then, if petitioned by landowners, adopting an ordinance to annex the same land.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the activist filed an action against the university claiming false arrest in violation of state law and &sect; 1983 and challenging the trespass policy as unconstitutional. The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment, holding that even assuming an arrest did occur, non-police defendants were not liable for merely summoning the police for assistance. Further, they were justified in calling the police when the activist refused to leave. Moreover, the police had qualified immunity from suit under &sect;1983 because the activist refused to give his name or to leave, and a reasonable officer could have believed there was probable cause to arrest him for trespassing. The officers also had immunity under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 32-12.1-15(2), as there was no showing of gross negligence or misconduct.

The trustee objected to the debtor's claimed exemptions, arguing to the bankruptcy court that &sect; 28-22-03.1(3) was unconstitutional because the statute provided an unlimited monetary exemption for personal property in violation of N.D.

The court concluded that &sect; 28-22-03.1(3) did not provide an unlimited monetary exemption for life insurance policies, individual retirement accounts, KEOGH plans and simplified employee pension plans; thus, the court did not need to determine whether the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

On consolidated appeal, the court reversed. The court held that its prior decision on the same issue resolved the federal constitutional argument because in such case the court held that a criminal prosecution for DUI did not constitute double jeopardy when a defendant's license had previously been suspended in an administrative hearing. As to the state statutory and constitutional arguments, the court again referred to its prior opinions holding that the framers of the state constitution and the state legislature did not intend an interpretation of double jeopardy different from that of double jeopardy under the federal constitution.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted his motion to dismiss, finding that he had a protectable property interest in his driver's license, that he was prejudiced by failure to require the complainant to give sworn testimony, and that the state's interest in prosecuting him was not great. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The court held that defendant was not prejudiced because N.D. R. Crim. P. 3(a) did not require an affidavit or sworn testimony. The legislature had determined by enacting N.D. Cent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the parties a divorce, divided the marital property, and placed custody of the parties' minor daughter with the former husband with the former wife to pay child support. There was testimony at trial concerning domestic violence by the former husband, including threats to kill the former wife, and also evidence that the former wife had slapped and scratched the former husband. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision concerning custody and ruled that trial court failed to make findings indicating that it sufficiently considered the statutory presumption against placing custody with a parent who had committed domestic violence as required by N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 14-09-06.2(1)(j). The court determined that the trial court's single finding from the opinion of a social-worker witness to minimize the former husband's violent conduct was unsatisfactory and was an improper delegation of the trial court's duty to make detailed findings about that conduct, weigh the violent conduct described in the testimony, and measure the propensity of each parent for continued violence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the lender's motion for summary judgment on the counterclaims and denied the borrowers' motion to file a second amended counterclaim for breach of contract for failing to subordinate the loan to another lender. The borrowers appealed. The court affirmed the dismissal of the bad faith claim and held that the borrowers failed to prove the existence of a contract or a duty under the Uniform Commercial Code to which a good-faith obligation could attach. The dismissal of the emotional distress claim was also affirmed because the lender's actions were not so extreme to be beyond all possible decency. However, the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to allow the borrowers to amend the counterclaim a second time because the breach of contract claim was a compulsory counterclaim, and if it was dismissed, res judicata prevented a second action by the borrowers.</SPAN></P>

Defendant, an African-American, contended that an instruction telling the jury to base credibility on appearance was racially suggestive, and that African-Americans were systematically excluded from jury service. He also claimed that his co-defendant's testimony was inadmissible because there was no corroboration. In affirming the conviction, the court held that the circumstances of defendant's arrest sufficiently corroborated the co-defendant's testimony. There was no error in the jury instruction on witness credibility and defendant's failure to object to it precluded a clarifying statement that would have dispelled any racial implication. Where census data indicated that only one in 367 county residents was African-American, defendant had not made a prima facie showing of exclusion through unsubstantiated assertions that the use of source lists other than voters and licensed drivers would have produced more minority members of the venire.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railroad did not dispute the necessity to modify a drain, bridges and culverts along a flood drain channel, but contended that it was required to pay for the modifications. On appeal, the court affirmed the summary judgment because the statute constitutionally placed the responsibility for the costs of accommodating its track to necessary drainage improvements on the railroad. The pertinent statute had remained almost unchanged since inception, and although it had never explicitly stated that a railroad was responsible for the costs of accommodating changes to drainage efforts, it had long been interpreted that way. The court considered whether the statute was an unconstitutional taking. After balancing the character of the governmental action, its economic impact, and its interference with reasonable investment-backed expectations, the court found the statute was constitutional. The railroad's obligation to adjust its bridges across a public drain, under a long-standing regulatory pattern that imposed the costs of accommodating the public's need for drainage improvements on the railroad itself, was not a taking because the public reasonably required the change.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the evidence, including testimony of an accident reconstruction expert that defendant could see the vehicle nearly a mile away and had 51 seconds to react to the vehicle's presence, established a reasonable inference of guilt and was sufficient to support the jury's verdict. The court further ruled that defendant was properly charged with aggravated reckless driving as defined by N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 39-08-03(2) (1987). The court declined to consider defendant's contention that the statutory language was void for vagueness because the constitutional question was raised for the first time in the briefs to the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff challengers appealed from the order of the District Court for Burleigh County, South Central Judicial District (North Dakota), that dismissed their action against defendant official and intervenor telephone companies, where the challengers claimed that Senate Bill 2385, enacted in 1993 and relating to the provision of dialing parity within local access and transport areas (LATAs), violated the North Dakota Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Senate Bill 2385 stated that, for a limited time, local telephone service providers could not be required to provide intra-LATA dialing parity, without access codes, to long distance providers not providing local service. The challengers provided long-distance service and they brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment that the bill was an unlawful delegation of legislative authority to private entities and that it violated N.D. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13, and other provisions. The complaint was dismissed and the challengers appealed. In affirming, the supreme court ruled that Senate Bill 2385 did not violate the state constitution. On its face, the bill appeared to be a general law that applied to local telephone service providers that were similarly situated with each other but not with inter-exchange long distance companies. The bill was not a special law in violation of &sect; 13; it had a rational basis and the classifications it made were reasonable. Moreover, the bill did not impermissibly delegate legislative powers to local service providers, but pertained only to the execution of laws that dealt with discrimination in the telecommunications industry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners contended that, under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 47-01-15, the landowners owned the shore zone to the low watermark, subjected only to a navigational servitude to the high watermark. The court concluded that, absent a contrary intent, the &quot;grant under which the riparian land was held&quot; included a riparian grantee's full interest in the shore zone, and necessarily precluded the state's claim of absolute ownership to the high watermark. However, the equal footing and public trust doctrines established that the state could not have totally abdicated its interest to the high watermark and that a riparian landowner's interest to the low watermark was not absolute. The court declined to speculate on the precise extent of the parties' rights and interests vis-a-vis the shore zone. To the extent the trial court held that the state had absolute title to the shore zone and the landowners had only riparian rights, the court held that the trial court erred. Neither party had absolute ownership of the shore zone. Instead, the state and the landowners had coexistent, overlapping interests in the shore zone. The court reversed the grant of partial summary judgment in favor of the state.</SPAN></P>

The state did not begin forfeiture proceedings against the vehicle until 174 days after the vehicle had been seized. Defendant claimed that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because the state had not &quot;instituted promptly&quot; forfeiture proceedings as required by N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 19-03.1-36(3). The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendant and dismissed the state's complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision and held that the length of the delay was a significant lapse of time that violated &sect; 19-03.1-36(3) and violated defendant's due process rights. The court ruled that no competent admissible evidence was introduced by the state that explained the reason for the delay, and there was no genuine dispute as to any material fact. The court held that defendant's due process rights were further prejudiced by the fact that the vehicle was seized without any prior process, which increased the risk that the state's seizure was an arbitrary encroachment on defendant's right to property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a foreclosure action, the trial court granted judgment for the mortgagee. The court affirmed that judgment. The mortgagor filed a motion to amend the judgment raising issues that had been previously litigated. The trial court denied the motion and imposed sanctions that prohibited the mortgagor from further litigating the issues without first receiving the trial court's permission and paying prior judgments. The court affirmed the judgment denying the motion to amend. The order imposing sanctions was modified, and as modified, it was affirmed. The mortgagor's notice of appeal from the dismissal of her bankruptcy did not revive the automatic stay. Thus, the trial court had jurisdiction when it granted judgment for the mortgagee. The record demonstrated a lengthy pattern of abuse of the legal process by the mortgagor. The injunction limiting future litigation was narrowly tailored to address those abuses. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in entering the order. By using the conjunctive &quot;and,&quot; the order may have precluded the mortgagor from bringing a meritorious claim merely because she was unable to pay the prior judgments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court failed to comply with Rule 11(b), N.D.R.Crim.P. (North Dakota), because the trial court had mistakenly used the term &quot;mandatory&quot; in place of &quot;maximum.&quot; Defendant also claimed that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel had failed to inform him of the possible sentence. The trial court summarily denied these grounds for relief because they had been raised by defendant on his direct appeal. The court affirmed on appeal, holding that defendant was barred by N.D.C.C. &sect; 29-32.1-12 (North Dakota) from raising this issue in a post-conviction proceeding because it had been raised on direct appeal. The standard of review for summary denial of post-conviction relief was the same as an appeal from a summary judgment. However, because defendant had raised the issues on direct appeal, those issues were barred as a matter of law. The court also affirmed the denial of relief based on alleged gender bias in sentencing because defendant had failed to present a prima facie case of gender bias in that his statistics on sentencing did not take into account the factors set forth in &sect; 12.1-32-04, N.D.C.C. (North Dakota).</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed finding that his conviction following the prior contempt judgment for failure to pay child support arrearages did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause because the contempt proceeding was civil in nature where defendant could have avoided it by appearing at the show cause hearing or paying the arrearage, which he was financially able to do. Section 14-07-15 was not unconstitutionally vague, although it may have been poorly drafted, because the boundaries of the proscribed conduct provided adequate warning where they found their genesis in the natural, moral, and legal obligations of parents. The trial court's instruction correctly advised the jury that defendant was criminally liable if his failure to support his children would have endangered their lives but for the assistance provided by someone other than their parents. Because no proof of actual harm to the children was required, there was sufficient evidence to support the guilty verdict because they would have suffered had it not been for the assistance of their stepfather and county social services.</SPAN></P>

Her report was also admitted into evidence. After the trial court awarded custody to the father, the mother appealed and filed a complaint against the psychologist, who was later reprimanded.

The court noted that the trial court did not find the mother to be an unsuitable parent. Instead, it found that the award of custody to the father was in the child's best interests. Furthermore, the trial court did not base its decision on the illogical testimony of the father's psychologist, as evidenced by the findings of fact.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court excluded the blood test results because the kit used to collect the blood was a &quot;device&quot; within the meaning of N.D.C.C. &sect; 39-20-07(5), and it had not been approved by the state toxicologist. It excluded defendant's prior DUI conviction because he had not knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to counsel. On appeal, the court noted that N.D.C.C. &sect; 29-28-07(5) allowed the prosecution to appeal from an order granting the return of property. The instant motions did not seek a return of property. Section 29-28-07(5) also allowed the prosecution to appeal from an order suppressing evidence. The court had construed this to mean an order suppressing evidence on the ground that it was illegally obtained under N.D. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(3). The evidence in this case was not excluded because it was illegally obtained. N.D.C.C. &sect; 29-28-07(1) allowed the prosecution to appeal from an order quashing an information or indictment. A prior conviction that enhanced a sentence, but not the seriousness of the offense, was not regarded as an element of the offense. Thus, the exclusion of the prior conviction did not have the effect of quashing the offense charged in the complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The districts sought a declaration that the statutory method for distributing funding to public schools was unconstitutional because it was based predominantly upon each school district's property tax base, which resulted in &quot;property poor&quot; school districts and their pupils receiving fewer educational resources. The court affirmed in part and held that the statutory scheme was unconstitutional. Strict scrutiny was not applicable, but the affected rights and interests supported use of the intermediate level of scrutiny. Although the statutory method for distributing funding did not totally deprive any student of access to the fundamental right to education, the method of distribution involved important substantive matters which required intermediate level scrutiny. The court held that the effect of the statutory method did not bear a close correspondence to the goals of providing an equal educational opportunity and of supporting education from state funds based on the educational cost per pupil. The trial court erred in mandating specific actions to be taken; it was not the usual function of the judiciary to supervise the legislative process in that manner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issues were: (1) whether the trial court erred in imposing a mandatory jail sentence where appellant was not informed of the mandatory minimum sentence under N.D.

Code &sect; 39-20 administrative suspension of license to mandate the imposition of a jail sentence in a subsequent driving under suspension conviction violated due process and other constitutional issues. The court found that appellant, through his attorney, had notice there was a mandatory minimum sentence of four consecutive days' imprisonment upon conviction of driving while his license was under suspension for an alcohol-related offense. The court held that the evidence in the record created a presumption that appellant was informed of the minimum mandatory sentence under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 39-06-42(2). The court found that appellant could not successfully dispute that he was informed of the minimum punishment upon conviction.

The trial court also ruled that the creditor's action was barred by the six-year statute of limitations under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 28-01-16(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The creditor instituted the action against the debtor to collect on an account. The trial court granted summary judgment for the debtor, concluding the account was a simple open account that had not been converted into an account stated by a written acknowledgment or promise to pay under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 28-01-36, or by an oral agreement. The creditor's action was barred by the six-year statute of limitations under &sect; 28-01-16(1). On appeal, the court reversed and held that &sect; 28-01-36 required a written acknowledgment or promise of a new or continuing contract for purposes of tolling the statute of limitations. Because there was no evidence of a written acknowledgment or promise signed by the party to be charged, the debtor, the trial court correctly determined the statute of limitations was not tolled on the basis of an account stated. The court held that partial payments on an open account could toll the statute of limitations for the entire debt if the partial payments were voluntary, free from uncertainty as to the identity of the debt, and made and accepted as partial payment of the larger debt under circumstances consistent with an intent to pay the entire debt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A sentencing court had committed the female convict to the Missouri River correctional center (Center). Instead of confining her at the Center, the warden held her at the prison. The reason for doing so was that the warden felt that all female prisoners would be better served at the prison. The convict sought and obtained a writ of habeas corpus. The court upheld the writ. North Dakota's statutory framework authorized a sentencing judge to initially select the place of a convict's confinement. Although the warden no doubt would have the power to move an individual from the Center to the prison for an individualized reason of safety, discipline, or medical care, or for particular conduct that interfered with the usual operation of the Center or with the welfare, safety, or best interests of other persons there, that was not the case. The warden claimed too much power when he argued that he could ignore the law and exclude the use of the Center by a sentencing judge for an entire category based on gender. The Legislature designated the Center to be used for rehabilitation of both males and females.</SPAN></P>

The child was born during the marriage of the husband and the wife. The district court ordered blood tests and denied the husband and wife's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court reversed the decision of the district court and dismissed the man's action. The court was satisfied that the blood test order threatened the protected family unit, affecting the husband and wife's substantial rights. Under normal circumstances, this appeal should have been dismissed. However, the facts presented in this case were not normal, the court had other means by which it exercised jurisdiction in this case. The orders affected the fundamental merits of the case and the court considered the appeal a request to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction. The man lacked standing to have brought an action disputing the paternity of the child. The man's contention that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 14-17-01 discriminated against him on the basis of his gender failed. The classification is rationally related to the legitimate legislative goal of protecting the family unit, and did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

Those defendants, and several other DUI arrestees, requested a jury trial and their cases were transferred to county court. Defendants filed motions to dismiss the charges. The county court granted the motions, concluding that the municipal court's order violated defendants' right to bail under N.D. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant power company sought trade secret protection of its price and volume tariff data submitted to appellee Public Service Commission (PSC) as part of a filing requirement.

The trial court found the tax unconstitutional, but dismissed the corporation's counterclaim. The state appealed while the corporation counterclaimed, but the supreme court reversed.

It was not error to conduct a blood test upon the motorist even though she had not been formally arrested. An incapacitated driver did not have to be arrested before being tested for blood-alcohol concentration. An arrest was not a statutory precondition of directing a blood test of a driver incapacitated in a serious accident; probable cause to believe that the incapacitated driver was under the influence of alcohol sufficed.</SPAN></P>

After the corporation filed a complaint with the commissioner, the hearing officer denied the corporation's claims. The commissioner, and then the trial court, affirmed those findings, and the corporation appealed. The court affirmed, holding that, due to the complex nature of the financial issue, the commissioner's expertise was entitled to appreciable deference, and that its methodology for treating the tax deductions under &sect; 57-38-01.3(1)(c) was permissible. The court found that N.D. Admin. Code &sect; 81-03-05.4, which limited the federal income tax deduction if taxable income in the United States was less than zero, did not exceed the bounds of the authority given to the commissioner by the legislature. Moreover, the commissioner's treatment of negative United States source income withstood an equal protection challenge because the encouragement of domestic income was an identifiable good purpose and provided a rational basis for sustaining the commissioner's actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the fee was a regulatory fee that was imposed solely to cover the cost of reviewing audit reports for political subdivisions when these audits were performed by private firms. While the trial court concluded that the fees charged were not arrived at in a reasonable manner, the statutory authorization of 1991 ND Laws ch. 576, &sect; 1 (North Dakota), which amended NDCC 54-10-14 (North Dakota), passed constitutional muster. The accounting firm contended that the language in the amendment gave the State Auditor impermissible discretion in implementing the statute, which was too vague, and was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. Affirming, the court held that legislature could delegate power to an executive agency; it was forbidden only from delegating the entire power to legislate. Further, the delegated power to ascertain facts for operation of a law was not unconstitutional if a reasonable guideline was given. The legislature simply directed the State Auditor to determine the costs related to each audit review and to charge those costs to the public accountant as it was impractical for it to determine the costs of each audit review.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 39-08-01(1)(a), 39-20-07(3) were not unconstitutional. Defendants failed to demonstrate that their prosecuted conduct of drunk driving was constitutionally protected activity. Thus, defendants lacked standing to challenge the statutes on overbreadth grounds. Defendants did not share a relationship with a third party that justified third party standing, and they did not rely on the constitutional rights of non-litigants who lacked an effective avenue of preserving their own rights. Further, the challenged statutes did not infringe upon the First Amendment. The court also found that the statutes did not violate defendants' rights to substantive due process. A person with a blood-alcohol content below 0.10 percent while driving could be convicted under the challenged statutes due to the time delay between arrest and testing.

The van drove ahead but stopped after 20 feet. The sheriff followed with his warning lights flashing and again stopped behind the van. The sheriff detected an odor of alcohol from defendant, and he learned from a radio check that defendant's license was suspended. The trial court, concluding that the officer had no reason to stop defendant, dismissed the charge against defendant for driving while his license was suspended. The court affirmed. The court held that while the initial contact with defendant may have been a caretaking encounter, it was converted into a seizure when the sheriff pursued defendant with his warning lights on to stop him as he started to drive away. Because the state conceded that the sheriff had no basis for an articulable and reasonable suspicion of a violation of law, the stop was an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The court further held that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 39-06-16 did not authorize the stop or make it reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A man was severely injured in a boating accident while riding on a tube that was being pulled behind a boat on a lake. He commenced an action against the manufacturer and retailer of the tube for the personal injuries sustained in the accident. Nearly three years subsequent to the entry of the jury verdict in the man's favor, his spouse and children brought their loss of consortium claims against the manufacturer and retailer. The court held that the compulsory joinder rule should be implemented prospectively, although fairness dictated that it not be applied prospectively in the instant case. Because compulsory joinder did not apply in the instant case, the wife was not barred from bringing her claim for loss of consortium. The children, however, did not have a cause of action for loss of parental consortium. The passage of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 32-03.2-04 was not an expansion of the class of potential plaintiffs in loss of consortium claims; rather, it expanded the types of damages available to an already-existing class of plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>

Defendant admitted the allegations, and his probation was revoked. Defendant then filed a motion for post-conviction relief seeking to withdraw his guilty plea. The trial court denied the petition.

The mother asserted that the homeowner and her guest were negligent in furnishing alcohol to the driver. The jury found that the deputies and the patrolmen were not negligent, that the homeowner did not furnish alcohol to the driver, that the guest's alcohol was not the proximate cause of the decedent's death, and that the decedent's negligence was the cause of his death. On appeal, the court affirmed that a prior statement by a deputy was inadmissible under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 31-08-07 because the mother had failed to furnish a copy of it to the deputy within 30 days. The jury instructions were a correct statement of the law on the duties of the deputies and patrolmen.

The court further explained that defendant's conduct could not have been conceived by a reasonable jury as negligent conduct when he beat and gagged the victim, hit him over the head with a large rock, and left him in a prone position. The court found that such conduct appeared intentional and willful, but not negligent. The court next found that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because language about causing the death of another human being under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life constituted a distinct and understandable definition of conduct proscribed.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying motions to sever the trials because each defendant was charged with the same criminal offenses by engaging in essentially the same conduct. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a motion for a change of venue because the record did not establish that the community was biased or that the jury was predisposed to finding against defendants. Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting the voir dire examination to two hours for defendants or in limiting the number of peremptory challenged for all defendants to eight and by requiring that the challenges be exercised jointly. Defendants failed to show any prejudice resulting from the time limitation and failed to show that they were denied a fair trial by the trial court's restriction of peremptory challenges.

The City of Fargo, North Dakota, appealed, claiming in part that the implied consent statute,&nbsp;NDCC 39-20-14 (North Dakota), represented the legislature's unconstitutional intrusion into the judiciary's right to determine the admissibility of evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant registered over .10 on an Alcohol Level Evaluation Roadside Tester (A.L.E.R.T.), which was a breathalyzer. The trial court suppressed the test result. On review, the court agreed that the test result was inadmissible. NDCC 39-20-14 provided that the A.L.E.R.T. test was used only to aid in determining probable cause to arrest. If probable cause was not disputed at trial, the test result was inadmissible, and defendant had conceded probable cause. The court also rejected the City's claim that NDCC 39-20-14 was unconstitutional in any way. The court provided an explanation of the interplay between statutory procedures and rules that the court had promulgated, ruling that absent a conflict, a statutory rule supplemented the rules of evidence. The evidence rules recognized the legislature's power to affect the admissibility of evidence, subject to the restriction that the court's rules prevailed whenever there was a conflict. Finally, the court stated that N.D. Const. Art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The clinic provided first trimester abortions and was targeted by anti-abortion demonstrations. Most of the demonstrations were peaceful, but some protestors committed criminal acts, such as, storming the clinic and locking themselves inside, assaulting patients, and harassing the doctors and staff. The clinic sought injunctive relief, which was granted. On appeal, the court affirmed the grant of a preliminary injunction, but reversed certain clauses and remanded. The court held that the injunction was aimed at the use of force, intimidation, and violence in expressing the protestors' opposition to abortion; the justification for the injunction was the method of communication and it was content-neutral. The court also held that the prohibition against protestors being within 100 feet of the clinic did not satisfy constitutional requirements because the record did not contain any description of the physical layout of the clinic and the court had no way to judge the place restriction. The court held that the protestors had a protected right to speak to people at the clinic and to hand out leaflets, but they could not do so in a harassing or abusive manner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner assessed an oil extraction tax against the company for field condensate. The company objected to the assessment, arguing that field condensate was produced after the custody transfer meter and was therefore not recovered &quot;on the lease&quot; as required by the definition of oil in N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 57-51.1-01(3). A hearing officer determined that field condensate was &quot;oil&quot; under &sect; 57-51.1-01(3). The Commissioner substantially adopted the hearing officer's recommendation, and the trial court affirmed the Commissioner's decision. The court concluded that the definition of &quot;oil&quot; in &sect; 57-51.1-01(3) was ambiguous. However, the construction of a statute by the agency administering the law was entitled to deference if that interpretation did not contradict clear and unambiguous statutory language. The Commissioner's interpretation was especially persuasive and entitled to deference because of the complex and technical nature of the oil extraction tax and because that interpretation comported with the language of the statute and the legislative history. Section 57-51.1-01(3) was not unconstitutionally vague because it provided adequate notice of the meaning of &quot;on the lease.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an administrative hearing, defendant's license was revoked for refusing an alcohol test. The district court affirmed the decision on appeal. On further appeal, the court concluded that the officer had articulable and reasonable grounds to stop defendant when he observed defendant's driving. Defendant's refusal to cooperate, his physical resistance, and his attempt to flee furnished probable cause to arrest him for preventing an officer from discharging his official duties. The fact that the officer did not immediately arrest defendant did not authorize defendant to leave during the stop and investigation. Defendant did not have a right to a court-appointed attorney for his arrest, booking, and testing because these events took place before his initial court appearance. Defendant did not show that his opportunity to contact an attorney by telephone was impeded or delayed in any way. Even if defendant was willing to consent to a test by a doctor, such a constricted consent was an effective refusal to take the test, and defendant's &quot;independent&quot; test at the hospital after release from the county jail did not cure the refusal to be tested while in police custody.</SPAN></P>

The minor and his parents filed a complaint alleging that the neighbors negligently maintained and operated their swimming pool, and added the pool companies as defendants. The minor and his parents settled their claim against the neighbors. The trial court granted summary judgment dismissing the action against the pool companies on the ground that it was barred by the six-year statute of limitations under N. D. Cent. Code &sect; 28-01-16. Plaintiffs relied on &sect; 28-01-32, which, at the time of the accident, tolled the statute of limitations for out-of-state persons. The pool companies claimed that &sect; 28-01-32 violated the Commerce Clause. Plaintiffs appealed the summary judgment, arguing that any determination that &sect; 28-01-32 was unconstitutional should be applied prospectively. The court held that &sect; 28-01-32 was unconstitutional, and that the determination as to the unconstitutionality of the statute applied retroactively to plaintiffs' action.

After a hearing, the trial court found defendant mentally ill, committed him to a hospital for treatment, and authorized forced medication as part of his treatment. Defendant claimed that his equal protection rights pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment and N.D. Const. art. I, &sect; 21 were violated because the post-criminal-trial procedures for insanity detainees under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 12.1-04.1 were different from those applied to persons committed in civil proceedings under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 25-03.1. On appeal, the court affirmed the order of the trial court. The court held that persons found not guilty by reason of insanity constituted a special class that could be constitutionally treated differently from other candidates for mental-health commitment, therefore, N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 12.1-04.1 did not violate defendant's equal protection rights. The court held that defendant had adequate notice that he might be subject to forced medication, and that his remedy was to petition the trial court for a change in his commitment order pursuant to N.D.

The court held that the lower court did not act arbitrarily, unreasonably, or unconscionably in denying the State's request for a six-month continuance. The court found that the State made no effort to conduct discovery during a long period during which it had the opportunity. The court held that the tax in question, N.D. Cent.

The court held that as a matter of law, the company's payment of the discriminatory taxes was not voluntary.

The officers had reason to stop defendant for investigation of a tavern fight, and the questioning, by itself, was not a Fourth Amendment violation. The officers, however, had no authority to badger and coerce him into compliance. The officer's physical control and sustained questioning of defendant became custodial interrogation that wrongfully detained him. However, the trial court nonetheless erred in dismissing the charge of preventing arrest because the official misconduct did not excuse defendant's forceful resistance as a matter of law.

The taxpayers' businesses did not constitute a unitary business because they did not meet the ownership requirement of the &quot;three unities&quot; test where no one person or entity included in the unitary group exercised sole control over the businesses. Because the attributes of unitary businesses were technical and complex, the commission did not exceed its legislative authority in adopting the ownership requirement absent statutory authority addressing combined reporting or ownership. The taxpayers did not meet the ownership requirement because they were controlled on consensus of the family members and no individual member of the family was included in the combined return.

The Cass County defendants were placed on a one-year conditional probation that they not go within a block of the clinic during probation. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Stutsman County defendant alleged that he was denied his right to a speedy trial because he was arrested on November 8, 1988, and December 12, 1988, but was not tried until April 6, 1990. The court held that, because defendant failed to show any prejudice by the delay in trial, he was not denied his right to a speedy trial. The Cass County defendants alleged that the trial court erred in refusing to admit testimony on their defense of necessity or lesser evil and in prohibiting them from going within a block of the protested abortion clinic as a condition of probation. The court held that defendants' criminal trespass at medical clinics to prevent legal abortions was not justified under any reasonable formulation of the necessity defense. Individuals had a constitutionally protected right to privacy and to obtain an abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. A state court could not prevent the lawful abortion and could not grant the right to private citizens to do so. The court held that the conditional probation was reasonable under the circumstances.

Defendant continued walking, never breaking his stride. Defendant was arrested for violating Bismarck, N.D., Ordinance 6-05-01(3). Defendant filed a motion for dismissal, claiming that the ordinance conflicted with N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 12.1-31.01(3). The trial court dismissed the action and the city appealed. The court held that there was no conflict and remanded the case. Defendant then filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that the ordinance was vague, overbroad, and that it was unconstitutionally applied. The trial court denied the motion and defendant was convicted. Defendant appealed and the court reversed, concluding that while defendant's conduct was offensive, there was no evidence that his language or conduct tended to incite an immediate breach of peace. The court determined that the inclusion the phrase conduct that &quot;inflicts injury&quot; in the jury instructions allowed the jury to convict defendant for conduct that was constitutionally protected.

The court reversed and remanded for entry of judgment in favor of appellant. The court held that the test for determining the constitutionality of collecting a use tax delineated in National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue, 386 U.S. 753 (1967), was obsolete because the economic, social, and commercial landscape upon which the case was premised no longer existed. Additionally, the court noted that the states' authority to tax interstate commerce had been broadened in the intervening years. The court held that appellee's significant economic presence within the state created a constitutionally sufficient nexus to justify imposition of the duty of collecting and remitting the use tax. Additionally, the court found that appellant provided benefits to appellee which aided its business and were related to the tax.</SPAN></P>

Cent. Code &sect; 12.1-01-05 because it superceded N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 5-02-06 by its provision for a lesser penalty for the sale of alcohol to minors than was mandated under the state statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city ordinance made the offense a class B misdemeanor while the state statute made the same offense a class A misdemeanor. On appeal, the issue was whether a city could provide a lesser penalty than state law for the same offense. The court did not consider Equal Protection Clause issues. The court noted that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 12.1-01-05 provided that by city ordinances could not supercede crimes defined by state law. The court found that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 40-05-01(29) granted municipalities the power to regulate the use and licensure of alcoholic beverages while N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 40-05-06 limited their ability to impose a penalty greater than a class B misdemeanor. The court applied the principle that statutes related to the same subject matter should be construed together and harmonized, if possible, to give meaningful effect to each, without rendering one or the other useless. The court held that the penalty of a municipal ordinance could differ from the penalty imposed by the state law in those situations in which the municipality authorized imposition of up to the maximum allowable municipal penalty that was lesser than the state law penalty for an equivalent statute.</SPAN></P>

The court found that these statutes created a per se crime but had not shifted the burden of proof because the State still had to prove the blood alcohol level and every other element. However, the court found that the jury instructions impermissibly advised the jury that the trial court deemed the tests to have been fairly administered, which shifted the burden to defendant to disprove fair administration of the test. The court held that the trial court went beyond its function of determining the threshold issue of the competency of the evidence and usurped the jury function of deciding its weight and credibility.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with driving under suspension, and his court-appointed counsel filed a pretrial motion, seeking a ruling by the trial court on the admissibility of evidence: that defendant's license was suspended after he failed to pay a fee due on a citation for driving a vehicle which did not display current registration, that his failure to pay that fee was caused by the fact that he was then a pauper, and that defendant was then a pauper because the government had caused the wrongful taking of his property. The trial court determined that the proffered evidence was inadmissible because it constituted a collateral attack on the administrative suspension of defendant's driver's license. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. Defendant contended that he should have been allowed to introduce evidence to establish the reason why his license was suspended. The administrative hearing was the appropriate forum for defendant to have contested the suspension.

The lessee claimed that he had a homestead exempt from eviction under &sect; 22 of Article XI of the North Dakota Constitution, N.D.C.C. &sect; 47-18-01, and case law. The State sought to evict the lessee as a holdover tenant. He lost title by foreclosure, from which he took no appeal, and the lease expired. The lessee claimed that N.D.C.C. &sect; 47-19.1-01 of the Marketable Record Title Act prevented eviction because the land was in his family's possession for at least 20 years. However, his chain of title did not remain unbroken for 20 years. Although the lessee contended that he was denied timely notice and did not have enough time to file an answer, he had 10 days, which was within the minimum and maximum prescribed by statute. He gave no reason why N.D.C.C. &sect;&sect; 27-07.1-23 and 29-15-21 were not employed. The lessee was not denied the opportunity to demand a change of judge. The court did not find all of the lessee's assertions to be so devoid of merit as to warrant Rule 38, N.D.R.App.P. sanctions.</SPAN></P>

The merchants filed an action seeking a judgment that the statute was unconstitutional on several grounds. The trial court found that the statute violated the equal protection clause, struck N.D.

The court reversed that portion of the trial court's judgment which found &sect;12.1-30-03&nbsp;unconstitutional and modified the statute, and otherwise affirmed.

Cent. Code &sect; 39-06-42 and that ordered reinstatement of defendant's license. Defendant's license had been suspended after he was convicted of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 39-08-01.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that it was error to find that defendant's license was not validly under suspension and to find that N.D.

The court agreed, reversed the judgment, and remanded the case, explaining that a person whose license had been suspended was not privileged to drive until he met the reinstatement requirements and regained his operator's license. Because defendant had not complied with the requirements for reinstatement of his driving privileges, including paying a reinstatement fee and submitting proof of financial responsibility, the court opined that his license was still under suspension when the incident giving rise to the instant charges occurred. The court opined that &sect; 39-06.1-10(3.1)(a) was neither constitutionally vague nor an unconstitutional delegation of judicial authority merely because it required a counselor or instruction of a licensed addiction treatment program to state that a defendant did not require an education or treatment program before the court would reinstate the defendant's license, reasoning that it was a valid exercise of police power to regulate persons driving on public roadways.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant contended that Fargo, N.D., Ordinance &sect;&sect; 25-1508(C)(12), 25-1508(E), and 25-1509(J) were discriminatorily enforced against it; the ordinances violated fundamental fairness and were unconstitutionally vague; that denial of the requested license transfer, based upon the ordinances was arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, and predicated on grounds not warranted by law; that the district court made clearly erroneous findings of fact; and that the matter should be remanded for a determination of the compensatory damages to which the applicant was entitled and to determine whether the city was required to issue a license to the applicant. The court held that the applicant's request for the transfer was properly denied on the basis of Fargo, N.D., Ordinance &sect; 25-1508(E), which was clear and not vague, and that the applicant was not treated in a disparate manner from a hotel in the community, which was issued a license under a different ordinance.

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the boiler inspectors, and the court affirmed. It held that the action was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.

The court stated that &sect; 12.1-32-07(4) gave defendant notice that violating the terms of his probation could result in a harsher sentence being imposed upon his probation being revoked. The court concluded that defendant had no expectation that the trial court's judgment ordering a harsher sentence was prohibited by the Double Jeopardy Clause. The court noted that defendant knew of the potential for a harsher sentence at the time he was placed on probation. The court also held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the State appropriately awaited the disposition of defendant's criminal charges prior to bringing the revocation proceedings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of removing a child from North Dakota in violation of a custody decree. His application for post-conviction relief was denied. The trial court also granted the State's motion to vacate a stay of judgment of imprisonment because no appeal was timely filed. On appeal, the court noted that an amended criminal judgment was entered on March 6, 1989. Defendant filed his application for post-conviction relief on March 13, 1989. An order denying the application for post-conviction relief was issued on April 18, 1989. Although it would have been better for the trial court to state the reasons for the denial, the April 1989 order was a final order. Thus defendant's June 2, 1989, notice of appeal from the amended criminal judgment was untimely. Defendant could properly be convicted in the county from which he removed the children. There was evidence that he formed the intent in that county to remove his children from North Dakota and that he began the journey to Oregon and Montana by taking the children out of that county. The 72-hour detention provision of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 14-14-22.1 was not a necessary element of the offense and could be severed from the statute.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied appellant's request for relief and held that the statutes,&nbsp;NDCC 25-03.1-22 and 25-03.1-31, afforded due process. The trial court also found that appellant's argument was premature and not ripe for review. The court dismissed the appeal and held as follows: (1) any constitutional problems which might exist were not ready for decision because of the contrasting settings for the efficacy of existing review procedures would soon apply to appellant; (2) the statutory procedures that appellant condemned as inadequate had no bearing on her present circumstances; (3) appellant's fears alone did not create a constitutional controversy to be decided; (4) an adjudication of the constitutionality of the statutory procedures in this case would have been equivalent to an impermissible advisory opinion; and (5) no present hardship would have resulted to appellant from withholding judicial consideration of her constitutional claims at this time.</SPAN></P>

The hospital agreed to make certain financial commitments, payments, and guarantees in order to assist the doctor in establishing a medical practice. Commencing with the second year of the agreement, the doctor agreed to pay for or reimburse the hospital for certain expenses. He failed to reimburse the hospital. The hospital brought an action against the doctor. The doctor quit his job and attempted to remove his belongings from the hospital. The hospital then applied for a writ of attachment. The trial court refused to grant a writ of attachment and held that the attachment statute was unconstitutional. The hospital appealed. The court held that the ex parte issuance of a writ of attachment on the doctor's property in accordance with the provisions of N.D. Cent. Code ch. 32-08.1 constituted a denial of due process of law. The court, therefore, denied a supervisory writ, which would have direct the trial court to vacate its order which held the attachment statute unconstitutional and which dissolved the writ of attachment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 40-05.1-09 barred the vote because the people had voted on the issue within the past two years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With voter approval, the city amended its charter and passed an ordinance imposing a sales and use tax to pay for a multi-purpose facility.

On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that, although the bonds were issued and the appeal was moot, the claim that &sect; 40-05.1-09&nbsp;unconstitutionally restricted the people's right to initiate legislation raised an issue of great public interest. The court ruled that the initiative and referendum power reserved to the people by N.D. Const. art.

The trial court denied the motion based on the length of the delay and the complexity of the case. The court affirmed and held as follows: (1) failure of a party to serve a timely demand in conformity with NDRCivP 38(b) constituted a waiver of the right to trial by jury; (2) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant relief to the waiver of a trial by jury; (3) the &quot;clearly erroneous&quot; standard governed review of the trial court's findings of fact because NDRCivP 52(a) governed appellate review of factual findings based upon documentary evidence as well as live testimony; and (4) the Constitutional issue raised on appeal was not considered because it was not presented at trial.</SPAN></P>

In 1988, the funeral home petitioned the county court for allowance and payment of its claim for funeral services. The principal officer of the funeral home testified from its business records that statements had been mailed to the son on five occasions in 1985. In allowing the claim, the county court determined that the son, as personal representative, had personal and constructive knowledge of the claim. The county court also found that the decedent's will had directed his personal representative to pay the funeral expenses out of the estate. The court held that the claim was presented by mailing and that evidence that a letter was mailed raised a disputable presumption that it was received by the addressee under NDCC 31-11-03(24). The estate offered no evidence to show that the mailings were not received.

Cent. Code &sect; 40-05-02. Defendant argued that the presumption found in the code was unlawful. The City had adopted the shoplifting ordinance, which defined the offense differently from the definition provided by the authorizing statute. The court noted the in passing upon the validity of an ordinance, it would not declare them invalid unless such ordinances were clearly arbitrary, unreasonable, and without relation to public health, safety, morals, or public welfare. The court also held that the use of a presumption in a criminal statute was proper so long as there was a rational connection between the fact provided and the ultimate fact presumed. The court found that rational connection existed here because the inference of shoplifting flowed from proof of willful concealment of merchandise.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The facility claimed it was an institution of public charity and therefore exempt from property taxation under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 57-02-08(8). The facility's application for abatement was initially disapproved. On appeal to the Board of County Commissioners, the application was also denied. The district court reversed and ordered the county to exempt the facility's property from taxation for 1987. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held the determination of whether an institution fell within the exemption was essentially a two-step process in which it must be determined whether the organization was a charitable one and whether the property on which the exemption was claimed was being devoted to charitable purposes. The court found the facility was organized for benevolent purposes and to support the mission of the Catholic Church. However, the court found that the facility's property was not actually being used for a charitable purpose. The court further found that there was no evidence that the facility's residents demonstrated need for care or charity and that most of the residents were fully capable of living on their own.</SPAN></P>

The Board concluded that the physician's use of chelation therapy was in direct violation of the terms of the stipulation and suspended his license to practice medicine. On appeal, the court held that enforcement of the stipulation did not work manifest injustice. The physician was not denied a fair hearing before an impartial tribunal. The Board's conclusions were sustained by its findings; and, under the terms of the stipulation, the Board was not required to make any additional conclusions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer filed this action after the tortfeasor assaulted him when he attempted to arrest him for driving while under the influence. The officer alleged that the tavern knowingly served the tortfeasor alcoholic beverages while he was intoxicated, which contributed to the officer's injuries. He obtained a damage award and fault was apportioned 75 percent to the tortfeasor and 25 percent to the tavern. Because the tortfeasor had no insurance, the officer was limited to recovery only from the tavern. The trial court denied the officer's motion to have the several liability provisions of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 32-03.2-02 declared unconstitutional so that both the tortfeasor and the tavern would be jointly and severally liable for the whole judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed and agreed with the trial court that the statute was not unconstitutional. Under the rational basis test, the court found that the statutory scheme was not patently arbitrary and it bore a rational relationship to the goal of improving the method of determining responsibility for the payment of damages. There was no error in the trial court's award of costs to the officer because it was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The jury returned a verdict for the company on the malicious prosecution action but awarded compensatory and punitive damages to the individual on the abuse of process claim. The individual had worked as a manager for one of the company's stores and was terminated for accepting prizes and premiums from product vendors in violation of company policy. The company then discovered that the individual would have been receiving profit-sharing funds and, allegedly, through use of the criminal process, schemed to extort money from the individual to recover the value of the prizes and premiums and also to satisfy the amount the individual owed on the second mortgage granted by the company. On review, the court affirmed, holding that (1) there was substantial evidence to support the jury's finding of abuse of process; (2) the awards of compensatory and punitive damages were not excessive and were supported by the evidence; and (3) the punitive damage award did not violate the excessive fines, due process, and equal protection clauses of both the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had found that defendants discriminated against the employee, but that a contractual term justified the later discrimination. The court held that there could be no contract for unlawful discriminatory treatment. Therefore, the court remanded for a new trial on the discrimination claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two of defendant's infant children drowned during a family camping trip when their small, relatively unstable boat capsized in adverse weather conditions as darkness approached. The State alleged that defendant was intoxicated at the time and that although personal flotation devices (PFDs) were on board, defendant failed to place them on the two victims who could not swim. The court upheld the conviction and the denial of defendant's post-trial motions. Although defendant might have been technically in compliance with the boat safety regulation regarding PFDs that only required them to be present on the boat but did not require them to be worn, the court held that such compliance did not preclude the jury from considering his failure to place the children in the devices as evidence of a violation of the negligent homicide statute. Further, the court held that North Dakota's negligent homicide statute met constitutional due process requirements. Merely because a law or regulation did not specifically point out or prohibit the various different means by which a crime was committed did not render a criminal statute unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The housing authority settled. The District Court for Grand Forks County, North Central Judicial District (North Dakota) granted summary judgment in favor of the manufacturer, which the mother and daughter appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother had removed the smoke alarm's battery, but forgot to replace it. On appeal, it was argued that the manufacturer was liable on the basis of both product, or strict, liability and negligence. The court affirmed and held that because the detector worked properly prior to the fire, the mother knew the detector required a battery, the mother removed the battery, and the detector posed no unreasonable danger beyond the contemplation of the ordinary user, or that of the mother. Reasonable persons could not have found the detector to be defective. The manufacturer had provided adequate instruction to inform the ordinary and prudent user that the detector did not work without a battery and could not have reasonably anticipated that a consumer would misuse the detector by removing, and then failing to replace, the battery despite the instructions provided with the detector. The manufacturer was not negligent for failing to provide a more specific warning and had no duty to warn the mother and daughter that the detector did not operate without a battery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendants guilty of obstructing public officers in the discharge of their duties in violation of Grand Forks, N.D., City Code &sect; 9-0205. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment against defendant one. The court concluded that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction of defendant one because, as a matter of law, his conduct in asking an officer why people were being arrested, without more, did not constitute physical obstruction of a public officer in the discharge of his duty. The court affirmed the judgment against defendant two. The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant two's conviction. The jury could have reasonably inferred that defendant two's refusal to leave upon being instructed to do so, stepping in front of the officer, and attempting to enter a house after being instructed to leave physically obstructed the officer in the performance of his duties. The court found that the trial court did not err in denying defendant two's motion for dismissal or his motion for a mistrial based on improper remarks by a prosecutor in his closing argument to the jury.</SPAN></P>

The store sent a notice of dishonor demanding payment within 10 days, which the first defendant did not do. Upon review, the court dismissed the appeals of the remaining three defendants because no judgment of conviction had been entered, but it affirmed the first defendant's conviction. Although the first defendant argued that &sect; 6-08-16 had been unconstitutionally and discriminatorily enforced against him, the court determined that no evidence was presented that his prosecution was invidious or in bad faith. Following a prior decision, the court noted that the state attorney's office no longer sent out notices of dishonor and did not inform local merchants that sending out such a notice was a prerequisite to a criminal prosecution. The court held that, based on witness testimony, the state attorney's office would prosecute a bad check writer whether or not a notice of dishonor had been sent or payment had been made. An agency or instrumentality theory was waived because it was raised for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The previous owner argued that the district court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment because there were material questions of fact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a judgment that granted the purchasers' motion for partial summary judgment in an action to quiet title, the previous owner sought review of the decision. The issue raised on review was whether the county auditor's office actually deposited in the mail letters containing notices of expiration of period of redemption. The court held that the county fulfilled the statutory notice requirements of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 57-28-04, when it mailed the notices, by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the homeowner's address as found on the certificate of title. It was reasoned that the fact that the previous owner did not actually receive the notices in her hand, or read them, or have them read to her, did not cause the service by the county to be improper. The court reasoned that the rights of the homeowner had to prevail over the expedition of the processes, and personal service by the sheriff was required of the notice of the expiration of the period of redemption upon a resident of North Dakota as required by N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 57-27-02(2). Thus, the court concluded that as to the homestead, N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 57-28-04, was violative of N.D. Const. art. I, &sect; 21.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that granted the purchasers' motion for summary judgment in an action to quiet title to the extent that it affected a homestead.

Cent. Code &sect; 14-06.1-15, requiring collection of a fee from every person filing a divorce action to fund a displaced homemaker program. The wife brought the action against defendants, clerk of the district court and the Department of Public Instruction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife asserted that the marriage dissolution fee violated due process and equal protection; N.D. Const. art. X, &sect;&sect; 3, 12; and N.D. Const. art. IV, &sect; 43. The court upheld the statute, concluding that a rational basis standard applied. No inherently suspect classification was involved, and the right to divorce did not constitute a fundamental right. The marriage dissolution fee did not significantly interfere with the right to obtain a divorce. The fee did not prohibit a person from a divorce because it was waived if the applicant was indigent. The fee caused some non-indigent persons to forego other uses of that amount of their resources, and imposed a relatively moderate financial effect on the decision to divorce. However, the hardship was not a preclusion. That the fee was not charged to other civil litigants did not constitute a significant burden on the right to obtain a divorce. The legislation recognized a distinct class who were in need of special assistance and served a legitimate governmental interest. The legislature reasonably believed that most of the persons who qualified as a displaced homemaker in need of assistance became so through a breakup of the family unit.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant petitioned the Supreme Court some nine years after his sentence was imposed. The court concluded that the language of Rule 35(b) did not permit a motion for reduction of sentence so long after sentencing.</SPAN></P>

Cent. Code &sect; 15-34.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents, who both had degrees in religious studies, home schooled their child. However, neither of the degrees qualified the parents to teach in North Dakota. As a result, the parents were not complying with the private-school exception to the compulsory attendance law. Nevertheless, at the trial court the parents successfully argued that the requirement that a teacher be legally certified by the state infringed on the parents' right to freely exercise their religion provided by the First Amendment to the federal constitution. On appeal, as a preliminary matter, the parents argued that the trial court's &quot;judgment of not guilty&quot; was an acquittal, which prevented the state from appealing. However, the court ultimately disagreed, reversed the trial court's decision, and remanded the case. The court determined that the trial court actually granted a dismissal of the complaint allowing the state to appeal. As a result, upon reaching the merits of the case, the court held that the requirements did not unconstitutionally infringe on the parent's rights because the state had a compelling interest in educating children that could not be accomplished by less restrictive means.</SPAN></P>

VIII authorized the legislature to create a system of public schools but did not authorize regulation of education in non-public schools, and that the compulsory attendance law violated U.S. Const. amend. I. The court affirmed and ruled that N.D. Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 1 through 4 together supported a plenary power to regulate all schools and that defendants' due process rights were not violated by the school board's ministerial duty to monitor proper school attendance. The court further ruled that the requirement of teacher and school approvals was the least intrusive means to protect the state interest in educating children and was consistent with the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of U.S. Const. amend.

Code &sect; 28-01-44 was unconstitutional. Applying the intermediate standard of review to the legislation which limited the substantive right to recover for personal injuries, the court found that there was a close correspondence between the statutory classification of persons injured within 10 years after substantial completion and persons injured more than 10 years afterwards. The 10-year period provided a reasonable time within deficiencies were likely to discovered. In response to the farmer's argument that the landlord should have had a reasonable duty of care, the court held that the common-law imposed no duty on landlords to their tenants for injuries due to dangerous conditions on leased premises.

Defendant filed a motion for a correction of sentence pursuant to N.D. R. Crim. P. 35(a). The trial court denied the motion, and defendant appealed.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction. It held that &sect; 62.1-02-11 was not unconstitutionally vague. The statute was reasonably clear and definite such that it sufficiently set forth the conduct proscribed.

The commissioner had issued a notice of determination and assessment of additional corporation income tax against the taxpayer for underpayment of taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A taxpayer was a multinational corporation. Thus, it had to apportion its business income to North Dakota under the three-factor formula in the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act. The commissioner applied a combined worldwide unitary apportionment for computing the taxpayer's federal income tax deduction under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 57-38-01.3(1)(c) and determined that it had underpaid its taxes. He assessed additional corporation income tax against the taxpayer, which paid the tax and then sought a refund, which was denied. It then sought judicial review of the commissioner's decision. On appeal from a judgment for the commissioner, the court held that: (1) the commissioner's method of determining the taxpayer's federal income tax deduction, which mixed the use of worldwide combined income with federal income taxes paid only on federal taxable income and under which the extent of the federal income tax deduction was dependent solely on whether the source of the unitary business' income was foreign or domestic, was improper; and (2) such method, which indiscriminately mixed incompatible concepts, created an internal inconsistency in applying &sect; 57-38-01.3(1)(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, which had upheld the tax commissioner's assessment and denial of the taxpayer's request for a refund. The court remanded the cause to the commissioner for a redetermination of the federal income tax deduction allowable to the taxpayer for the years in question.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax commissioner assessed additional state corporate income and business privilege taxes against the taxpayer. On appeal, the district court reversed the commissioner's assessment. The commissioner claimed that the taxpayer could not deduct mileage credits paid to it by rail carriers as a shipper supplying its own railroad cars in determining the net annual rental rate of leased cars in computing the taxpayer's property factor for apportioning income to North Dakota, and it could not exclude the foreign dividend gross-up required for federal income tax purposes before apportionment to North Dakota. On appeal, the court reversed the district court's decision. The court held that: (1) the mileage credits were not &quot;subrentals&quot; within the meaning of N.D. Cent. Code &sect;57-38.1-11 and thus, were not deductible; (2) although net annual rental reduced by a deduction for the credit equaled the shipper's net monetary cost, &sect; 57-38.1-11 did not expressly permit the deduction; and (3) where the taxpayer's foreign subsidiaries had a unitary business relationship with the shipper and the state, the due process clause did not preclude the state from taxing the dividend gross-up.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant raised two issues: (1) that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 62.1-02-01(1) was unconstitutional because it violated his right to keep and bear arms under N.D. Const. art. I, &sect; 1; and (2) that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial. Defendant argued that the right to bear arms was absolute. The court disagreed with such a broad reading of the provision. The right to keep and bear arms was not absolute; although it prevented the negation of the right to keep and bear arms, that right nevertheless remained subject to reasonable regulation under the State's police power. Thus, N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 62.1-02-01(1) did not violate the right to keep and bear arms. Defendant next contended that he was denied effective assistance of counsel and based this claim on his trial counsel's request for a subpoena to compel a witness to appear at his trial. The only indication of what that testimony would have been was the representations of defendant's counsel on appeal. More than a mere representation of what the testimony would be was necessary. Thus, the court was unable to conclude from the record that defendant's trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, but without prejudice to defendant to raise his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at a proceeding for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

The Commissioner refused to compensate the corporation for the expenses incurred in relocating the water line pursuant to N.D. Cent. Code &sect;&sect; 24-01-42, 24-01-43.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the House approved a bill by majority vote, it was transmitted to the Senate for consideration. The Senate's president refused to accept the bill on the ground that the bill, which repealed an initiated measure, failed to pass the House by a two-thirds majority vote which he believed was necessary under the constitution. The bill was returned to the House without first submitting it for consideration by the Senate. Petitioners argued mandamus relief was appropriate because the issue was whether the state constitution required the approval of the bill by two-thirds of the members of each house. The court however, concluded that the constitutional issue was not the dispositive issue in the case and was not ripe for adjudication. Instead, it found that the key issue on the merits was whether or not Senate leaders, under that legislative body's procedural rules, properly rejected the bill? The court held the issue was capable of legislative determination and it declined to exercise its original jurisdiction over the matter.</SPAN></P>

Cent. Code &sect; 15-34.2-06.1, which authorized defendant school district to charge a fee for its schoolbus service. The parents asserted that the fee violated N.D. art. VIII, &sect; 2's mandate for a uniform system of free public schools.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district offered schoolbus transportation to and from school for students residing more than three or four miles from the school. In order for students to receive such transportation, parents had to sign a contract agreeing to pay a fee to defray part of the cost. The parents refused to sign the contract and brought their children to school at greater cost to them. They filed their action to enjoin collection of any fee for schoolbus transportation on the grounds that it was unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the action. On appeal, the court, noting the long-standing legislative practice of making student transportation a shared responsibility between school districts and parents, determined that N.D. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2's requirement of a uniform system of free public schools did not mandate free student transportation. The court ruled that transportation was not an integral part of the educational system to which N.D. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2 referred in mandating free public schools. The court also ruled that the fee did not discriminate against poor persons because the fee was rationally related to the State's legitimate interest in allocating limited resources.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's judgment dismissing the parents' action on its merits.</SPAN></P>

The debtors filed motions for relief from judgment under N.D. R. Civ. P. 60(b). The trial court denied the motions. The sheriff levied upon an airplane, which was collateral for the debt, and sold it at a public auction. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that the debtors failed to establish that there had been an assignment or sale of a lease purchase agreement to the creditor. Even if there had been an assignment, they failed to show that it was newly discovered evidence that they couldn't by reasonable diligence have produced before. The court determined that the creditor did not impermissibly combine Uniform Commercial Code remedies and non-Code remedies because it obtained a judgment on the debt and proceeded by execution and levy. This was a non-Code alternative available to the creditor. The notice and commercial reasonableness requirements of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 41-09-50(3) did not apply when the creditor executed on the judgment in a non-Code procedure.</SPAN></P>

The District Court of Stutsman County (North Dakota) dismissed the employee's claim for violation of his due process rights and limited his recovery of damages for breach of contract and interference with his contract.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee argued that his due process claim was valid and that his recovery should not have been limited. The city and the mayor contended that there was no breach of contract and the mayor contended that he did not intentionally interfere with the employee's contract. The court affirmed the damage limitation, the dismissal of the due process claim, and the breach of contract holding, but reversed and remanded the holding of intentional interference. The court affirmed the breach of contract because the mayor did not have authority to terminate the employee without city council approval. However, the court upheld the damage limitation to the time between the unlawful termination and the approval by council because the council had authority to terminate the employee. The court also held that, as an at will employee, there was no due process entitlement to notice and a hearing before termination, and thus this claim was properly dismissed. However, the court also held that evidence of whether the mayor acted in good faith in terminating the employee was erroneously omitted and required reversal because it was relevant to the determination of tortious interference.</SPAN></P>

The hospital brought an action against the nursing board challenging the constitutional validity of the rules, arguing that the authority given to the nursing board through N.D. Cent.

The court ruled that the legislature could not delegate its power to make a law, but it could make a law to delegate a power to determine some fact or state of things upon which the law makes, or intends to make, its own action depend. The court affirmed the judgment upholding the constitutionality of the rules, concluding that while purely legislative powers could not be delegated, the legislature could authorize others to do certain things and to exercise certain powers which were not exclusively legislative and which the legislature itself could do but could not because of the detailed nature of the things to be done.</SPAN></P>

In an effort to recover the land, they commenced lawsuits against everyone they thought might have been connected with the subject matter of their grievances.

The trial court convicted defendants of threatening public servants, and defendants sought review. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to exclude from evidence the threatening letters sent to the board for lack of authentication. The court concluded that defendants' letters, entitled &quot;Constructive Notice and Demand,&quot; did not fall within the proscription of the statute that defendants were convicted under, N.D. Cent.

The issues were whether the summary judgment was warranted in light of the state's confiscatory-price defense statutes,&nbsp;N.D. Cent. Code &sect;&sect; 28-29-04, 28-29-05, 28-29-06, and whether 12 C.F.R. &sect; 614.4510(d) provided an affirmative defense to the debtors that the trial court overlooked.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the bank sought to foreclose, the debtors argued two defenses. First, that the collateral was so much more greater in value than the debt that the trial court should forebear to grant the judgment under the state's confiscatory-price defense statutes,&nbsp;N.D. Cent. Code &sect;&sect; 28-29-04, 28-29-05, 28-29-06. In addition, the debtors argued that the federally guaranteed loan was subject to a similar, mandatory forbearance option under 12 C.F.R. &sect; 614.4510(d). The trial court made no findings of fact as to either defense and granted the bank a summary judgment. On review the court held that the state statutes were still valid law, and that it was improper for the trial court to grant a summary judgment where the debtors had filed an affidavit setting out a confiscatory-price defense. The court also held that there was conflicting authority as to whether the federal regulation provided the debtors a defense, or was merely a non-binding policy guideline for the bank. Based on the inadequate factual record before it, the court could not choose which authority it would adopt or determine the factual question of whether the debtors even qualified for the alleged regulatory forbearance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment of foreclosure against the debtors' property and directed that any sale pursuant to that judgment be vacated. The court remanded the case for a trial on the confiscatory-price defense and for the resolution of factual issues and the development of an adequate record on the debtors' claim that they were improperly denied by the bank an administrative forbearance under the federal regulation.</SPAN></P>

The help clinic provided anti-abortion counseling services and did not perform abortions. A preliminary injunction was issued to prevent the help clinic from using deceptive advertising practices to mislead persons seeking abortions into believing that the help clinic performed abortions. The court affirmed the contempt finding against the clinic and three of the directors, but reversed as to the remaining directors. The trial court did not err in admitting tapes and transcripts of phone calls made to the help clinic by people hired by a private investigator. The tapes were obtained legally under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 12.1-15-02(3)(c) because consent to record the calls was obtained of the people making the calls. The admission of an affidavit that was not properly notarized was not prejudicial because the subject of the affidavit had already been established in evidence. Some of the directors were not liable for contempt because there was no evidence of knowledge by those individuals of the acts of the help clinic.

The decedent's mother brought an action alleging products liability, negligence, breach of implied warranty, and strict liability in tort after her son was killed in a work-related accident involving one of the manufacturer's machines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court dismissed the action after concluding that it was barred by the applicable statute of repose, N.D.

The court reversed the judgment finding that &sect;28-01.1-02 was unconstitutional. The court determined that the right to recover for personal injuries was an important substantive right and as such, the appropriate standard of review to be applied in this case was the close correspondence test or the intermediate test. Applying this standard, the court noted that the legislative history indicated that the purpose for creating the arbitrary time periods contained in &sect;28-01.1-02 was the economic interests of the manufacturers and suppliers of products. The court reasoned that when human life and safety were involved more was required for a justification than a reference to the economics of suppliers of goods. It concluded that there was no close correspondence between the classifications created by &sect;28-01.1-02 and the stated legislative goals so as to justify the unequal treatment wrought by &sect;28-01.1-02.</SPAN></P>

They asserted that the compulsory school attendance laws, as applied to them, unconstitutionally infringed upon their religious beliefs protected under the free exercise clause of the First Amendment. The court affirmed the convictions on appeal. The court assumed that the parents were motivated by sincerely held religious beliefs. The parents demonstrated a burden upon their religious beliefs sufficient to require the court to balance that burden against the State's interest in the teacher certification requirement. Certification was among the least intrusive methods available to satisfy the State's interest in seeing that its children were taught by capable persons. The certification requirement for instructors in public, non-public, or home schools was reasonably narrow. The court concluded that the State had an interest in the certification feature of the compulsory school attendance laws that was sufficient to override the burden imposed upon the parents' religious interests.</SPAN></P>

The county court possessed jurisdiction over the case because practicing law without a license was a criminal misdemeanor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner purchased residential property upon which a flood protection dike had been constructed. A previous owner had granted the Water Management District one of many permanent easements for flood protection. On appeal, the property owner asserted that the City was estopped by its actions from requiring him to remove a fence, and that he had been improperly subjected to selective enforcement. The court was unable to conclude, that the City was estopped by its actions or those of the Water Board or its members from requiring the property owner to remove the fence, the construction of which the City was clearly empowered to prevent under the unambiguous terms of the easement. The City Engineer clearly exceeded his authority when he granted the property owner permission to build the fence. The City was not estopped by an act of its engineer in excess of his authority. The facts did not prove intentional or purposeful discrimination. The trial court's finding, that appellants could have built a fence parallel to the river but off the easement area, which would have accomplished everything in the way of safety that the present fence accomplished, was not clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

Cent. Code &sect; 4-12.2-10 and N.D. Admin. Code &sect; 7-02-02-06, which both regulated the beekeeping industry, were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners commenced a declaratory action, contending that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 4-12.2-10 and N.D. Admin. Code &sect; 7-02-02-06&nbsp;unconstitutionally discriminated against property owners who did not own and manage bees by imposing restrictions on crop pollination that are not applicable to property owners who owned and managed bees. By enacting the two-mile radius restriction, the legislature sought to prevent honey raiding and the spread of bee diseases. The trial court dismissed the property owners' complaint. The property owners appealed. The court held that the property owners did not show that the challenged statute and rule contravened the state or federal constitution. The classification contained in the statute and rule was not arbitrary or violative of the Equal Protection Clause because the facts sustained it. The two-mile radius rule, even with the exception for property owners who owned and managed bees, had a manifest tendency to lessen the evils of honey raiding and the spreading of bee diseases. Thus, treating the two groups of property owners differently was rationally related to the statutory goals of preventing honey raiding and the spreading of bee diseases.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to four days in jail to be served consecutively, given a fine, and ordered to submit to alcohol evaluation.

As a practical consequence of the holding, municipal courts were required to obtain a valid waiver of counsel on the record, afford a nonindigent defendant the opportunity to retain counsel, or appoint counsel for an indigent DUI defendant regardless of the penalty, if enhancement of punishment for a subsequent conviction was not to be precluded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being charged, defendant made a motion supported by affidavit and brief for dismissal on the ground his prosecution was barred by N.D.

Defendant's first and subsequent motions for dismissal were denied, but the third was granted on constitutional grounds. The State contended that the trial court erred in reaching its conclusion because defendant lacked standing to raise the constitutional claims. The court held that the trial court erred in deciding the constitutional issues because defendant failed to establish any factual basis that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 12.1-20-03(2)(a) was vague in all its applications or as applied to him and failed to demonstrate that the statute was overbroad as applied to his conduct because there was nothing in the record indicating that he was being prosecuted for constitutionally protected conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was killed when he struck the electric company's unmarked guy wire while snowmobiling. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the electric company based upon its determination that N.D. Cent.

The court concluded that there was no evidence of willful or malicious conduct by the electric company. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the statute clearly limited the liability of landowners for injuries sustained by recreational users of land. The court found that the language of the statute was sufficiently broad to encompass a holder of an easement over a public highway. The court determined that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because there was evidence from which the jury could have inferred that the electric company willfully failed to guard or warn against a dangerous condition. The court noted that the company knew that the unmarked wires posed a risk to snowmobilers, and that the harm could have been averted by the maintenance of guards around the guy wires.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insurers challenged two judgments from the South Central Judicial District Court of Burleigh County (North Dakota) that denied their claims for refunds after the determination by the district court that the two and a half percent gross insurance premiums tax, levied under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 26-01-11 was unconstitutional. Defendants, state and commissioner of insurance (state), cross-appealed from the determination of unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue before the court was whether or not North Dakota's pre-1983 version of the two and a half percent gross insurance premiums tax, under &sect; 26-01-11(1), from which insurance companies organized under the laws of North Dakota were exempt, violated the equal protection components of the state and United States Constitutions. The district court determined that the statute was unconstitutional and issued an injunction prohibiting its enforcement, but refused to grant damages or refunds for the tax years 1971 through 1981 to the 16 out-of-state insurance companies that challenged the tax. The court affirmed the determinations, concluding that none of the purposes advanced by the state were legitimate when furthered by discrimination, or if legitimate, that the tax was not rationally related to the achievement of the purposes. The court concluded that the district court properly gave its ruling a purely prospective application, thereby effectively denying claims for refunds, as the state government relied on the tax when preparing its budgets based on justified presumptions of the validity of the tax statute and reimbursement would have caused significant hardships.</SPAN></P>

The trial court reversed the order of the board, concluding that the board had no authority to place the courthouse on the registry under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 55-10-02(4). On appeal, the court held that the legislature's failure to define the term historical value as used in &sect; 55-10-02(4) did not deprive the board of the authority to add new sites to the registry. The court stated that if the board were deprived of such authority because of the omission of the definition of historical value, &sect; 55-10-02(4) would be entirely surplusage and would have no effectiveness. The court stated that such a construction would be inconsistent with applicable rules of statutory construction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought to vacate his convictions in the Stark County Court (North Dakota), for eight counts of issuing checks without sufficient funds in violation of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 6-08-16 (1981).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At an appearance before the trial court without counsel, defendant waived his right to a jury trial. Defendant failed to appear for trial and was arrested. After additional continuances at defendant's request, defendant and his court-appointed counsel appeared for trial but requested a jury trial. The trial court refused the request and found defendant guilty. At the trial, defendant's sole defense was his testimony that when issuing the eight checks he was under the impression there were sufficient funds deposited in his account. The court held that: (1) N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 6-08-16 (1981) was not violative of the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV or N.D. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 21, 22 because it made no classification on the basis of wealth; (2) no good faith defense was available to &sect; 6-08-16 because it was a strict liability offense; (3) defendant voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his right to a jury trial; and (4) the trial court properly denied defendant's request on the day of trial for a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions.</SPAN></P>
