</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant putative father challenged the judgment of the Superior Court, Chancery Division, Monmouth County (New Jersey), which directed defendant to submit to a blood test to determine paternity of a child born during plaintiff mother's marriage to the presumed father in plaintiff's action for child support.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother received child support from the presumed father for a child born during their marriage. Later, plaintiff informed the child that defendant putative father was the child's biological father and sought child support payments from defendant. Defendant denied paternity. The trial court ordered plaintiff, defendant, the child, and the presumed father to submit to a blood test. The trial court dismissed plaintiff's claim, sua sponte, amended the complaint to include the child, and appointed an ad litem for the child. On appeal, the court held that plaintiff's claim was barred by the entire controversy doctrine because the paternity claim should have been joined with the divorce suit. Plaintiff's claim was also barred by judicial estoppel because her assertion of the presumed father's paternity was inconsistent with her assertion of defendant's paternity of the same child. Also, the child's claim was not barred by plaintiff's preclusion, collateral estoppel, or res judicata because there was no privity. The court held that requiring defendant to submit to a blood test was premature because the presumption of the presumed father's paternity had not been rebutted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff widow sought review of the trial court's denial of her request to disinter her deceased husband's body from a cemetery that was not properly maintained. Plaintiff asserted that N.J. Stat.

The court affirmed the order and found that the statute permitted disinterment without recourse to a court when the requisite consents were forthcoming, but it did not preclude a court order for disinterment in an appropriate case even over the objection of a spouse or adult child. Plaintiff failed to establish good cause for her application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff township challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Cumberland County, which held that Upper Deerfield Township, N.J., Township Code ch. 50, art. III, &sect; 7 (1989) was unconstitutional and that defendant property owner did not have to obtain a certificate of occupancy prior to selling property that included a vacant house.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant property owner transferred title to the purchaser without obtaining a certificate of occupancy as required by Upper Deerfield Township, N.J., Township Code ch. 50, art. III, &sect; 7 (1989). The purchaser assumed the obligation of obtaining the certificate and making any required repairs to a vacant house on the property. Defendant was found guilty of violating the ordinance, fined, and ordered to comply with the ordinance within two weeks. On defendant's application for a de novo trial, the judge raised the issue of the constitutionality of the ordinance. The trial court held that &sect; 7 was invalid, and the court affirmed and dismissed the complaint against defendant. The court held that the ordinance interfered with defendant's right to acquire, own, and dispose of real property, a right that was within the protections of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.J. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The reasonable exercise of police power was allowed; but the court held that the ordinance's regulatory reach was overbroad because in requiring an occupancy permit before an abandoned vacant structure could be sold the ordinance bore no real and substantial relationship to legitimate government purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the finding that plaintiff township's ordinance requiring defendant property owner to obtain a certificate of occupancy prior to selling property that included a vacant house was unconstitutional and dismissed the complaint against defendant because the overbroad ordinance unconstitutionally interfered with defendant's right to acquire, own, and dispose of real property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant protestors challenge an order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Bergen County, which denied appellants' application for counsel fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988, contending that they were &quot;prevailing parties&quot; in an action to enforce their civil rights and that they were entitled to have their attorney's fees paid for obtaining an order directing respondent township and its manager issue a permit to march in the street.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant protesters filed suit against respondent township and its manager arising out of respondents' failure to issue a special events permit to appellants for a protest march in a street. The trial court required respondents to issue a permit to appellants for a march to be conducted in the street, and it denied appellants' application for attorney's fees and costs, finding that the issue before the trial court was not a substantial, constitutional issue. The court reversed the trial court's order denying counsel fees and costs. The court held that when the trial judge concluded that the refusal to issue a permit to march in the street violated the federal Constitution, by implication there was also a violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 because defendants acted under color of the municipal code to deprive plaintiffs of their constitutional right to march peacefully in the street. The court held that appellants were prevailing parties within the contemplation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged her convictions from the Superior Court of Passaic County (New Jersey), for possession of heroin with intent to distribute within 1,000 feet of school property, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-7, and questioned the constitutionality of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-12, which permitted a court to waive a mandatory sentence only with the approval of the prosecutor. Defendant had entered a plea agreement, but tried to withdraw her pleas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In reviewing defendant's drug convictions, the court found that the trial judge meticulously adhered to the rules in accepting defendant's guilty plea. The court found that defendant candidly acknowledged guilt and was questioned exhaustively concerning the plea agreement, and that the judge accepted her plea only after satisfying himself that her decision not to contest the charges was made voluntarily and with knowledge of her alternatives and options. Consequently, the court held that there was no abuse of discretion in denying defendant's motion to withdraw her pleas. The court also held that the judiciary was not deprived of its sentencing powers and that the statutes did not unlawfully delegate sentencing responsibility to the executive branch. However, the court recommended that guidelines and standards be adopted in conjunction with the prosecutor's statutory power to waive a mandatory sentence. Because the trial court did not have the benefit of a recent case, the court decided, in the interest of justice, to remand for reconsideration, so that defendant could challenge the prosecutor's exercise of discretion as arbitrary and capricious.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant water commission sought review of a decision from the Superior Court of New Jersey, Passaic County, declaring that appellant's policy of pre-employment drug testing violated the Constitutions of both the United States and the state of New Jersey and respondent prospective employee cross-appealed the dismissal of his claim for relief under federal and state civil rights legislation,&nbsp;42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and N.J.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 10:5-1 et seq., contending that appellant refused to hire him as a water meter reader because he refused to submit to a pre-employment drug test. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment declaring that appellant's policy of pre-employment drug testing violated the U.S. Cons. amend. IV. The court also affirmed the trial court's judgment dismissing respondent's claims for punitive damages and attorney's fees since the court determined that appellant's reasons for not hiring respondent were independent of his refusal of the drug testing. The court found that the record failed to support the required nexus between positive drug testing and the risk of meter reader criminality on the job, as such the risk to the public safety by reason of an employee's impaired judgment due to drug use was minimal and could not sustain a policy of involuntary drug testing by appellant. The court concluded that drug testing was not an indispensable screening device for achieving a trustworthy work force.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The approval of respondent mayor's application for site plan approval and a bulk variance for a combination office and apartment building by respondent planning board, over the opposition of appellant objectors, was reversed in part and remanded for a new application process to be conducted. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court with one modification. The court concluded that respondent planning board should again consider the issue of whether respondent mayor's proposal required a use variance per N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55D-70(d) and zoning board approval. The court concluded that the peculiarity of the relevant ordinance and the particularized circumstances of the unique community required a complete reconsideration of the application. The highly discretionary nature of the many questions raised during the course of the application procedure, the rigorous contest of the issues at each level, and the pertinent legal authorities all counseled a new consideration of the issues, free from potential taint. The court determined that respondent mayor was under no necessity or compulsion to seize upon and promote development opportunities during his term of office.</SPAN></P>

Defendant police officers arrested plaintiff outside a local tavern for using offensive language. Plaintiff was charged with disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and aggravated assault upon a police officer. Plaintiff filed a cross-criminal complaint against defendants charging them with aggravated assault, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:12-1b(1) and official misconduct, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:30-2. The trial judge found the action was time-barred under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:14-2. Plaintiff was convicted of simple assault and acquitted on the resisting arrest charges. On appeal, the court held that there was no showing that the state's pursuit of the criminal complaint against plaintiff was for the purpose of deterring or inhibiting his civil action against defendants. Further, the court held that there had been no showing that plaintiff was deprived of his freedom of will to justify a tolling of the statute. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the trial court should not have dismissed the indictment on the ground that defendants were disposing of waste on their own property because it was unclear whether disposal on one's own property required a certificate of public necessity and the filing of a tariff.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a sentence by the Superior Court of New Jersey, Camden County, which imposed a five-year sentence with a three year period of parole ineligibility after defendant violated his probation for the offense of distribution of cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a five-year sentence with a three-year period of parole ineligibility. Defendant pleaded guilty to distribution of cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school, and the state waived the mandatory period of parole ineligibility unless defendant committed a probation violation. The presumptive term would have been four years. Defendant violated probation, and the state argued that its waiver was for the initial plea only. The court reversed the sentence and held that the trial court was not bound by a plea agreement that attempted to bind it to revoke probation and impose a jail term simply because there was a violation of probation. The trial court had to determine whether defendant's violations warranted a revocation of his probation. Even if a revocation of probation was warranted, the trial court had to weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors at the time of the initial sentencing to determine whether to impose the presumptive sentence or one that was more appropriate. The trial judge could not have increased the presumptive term unless he found that the preponderance of aggravating factors weighed in favor of a higher term and the weighing process did not occur.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord appealed from the dismissal of the complaints for eviction against defendant tenants. The court reversed and held that plaintiff had complied in all respects with the requirements of the Anti-Eviction Act and its implementing regulations. The court was satisfied that plaintiff's notice of intention clearly informed defendants of their right to purchase their units. Service by mail was deemed complete upon mailing rather than upon receipt so 61 days elapsed between plaintiff's mailing of the notice of intention and the notice of eviction. Further, plaintiff clearly complied with the requirement of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:18-61.2(g) that three years' notice be given prior to the institution of the action. Although the trial court found that plaintiff failed to include a summary of tenants' rights approved by the Department of Community Affairs (DCA) with the notice of intention, the court disagreed and found that the regulation clearly indicated that if the notice of intention was accompanied by a copy of DCA's regulations governing condominium conversions, an approved summary of tenants' rights was not required.</SPAN></P>

Defendant failed to appear for sentencing and was sentenced to four years in the custody imprisonment, with three years to be served before he was eligible for parole. The court remanded the case and held that the trial court was to give defendant the opportunity to renegotiate or withdraw his plea. The court held that the only authorized sentence for a &sect; 2C:35-7 violation required a mandatory ineligibility term, except and only to the extent that the state recommended otherwise under N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, which sentenced him to a four-year term of imprisonment with a mandatory three-year parole ineligibility after defendant failed to appear at his sentencing hearing. The state withdrew its recommendation of a one-year period of parole ineligibility pursuant to a plea agreement under which defendant was convicted of distribution of cocaine within 1,000 feet of school property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under a plea agreement, defendant was convicted of distribution of cocaine in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-7, with a recommendation that he receive a one-year period of parole ineligibility rather than the mandated three-year period. Defendant violated a condition of the agreement when he failed to appear at his sentencing hearing and the state withdrew its recommendation. At sentencing, defendant received the mandated three-year period and the trial court announced it found no aggravating or mitigating factors for his nonappearance. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, but remanded so that the parole eligibility period could be reduced to one-year. The court held that the trial court erred in automatically applying the nonappearance condition to sentence defendant to the mandatory term in light of its specific finding that no aggravating factors applied. The court found that the nonappearance condition in the agreement, if enforceable, placed an additional limitation on the judiciary's already severely circumscribed sentencing authority. The court held that defendant's claim that the applicable statutes were unconstitutional was without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners brought a class action suit against defendants, city and city employees, seeking damages and injunctive and declaratory relief for property damage that resulted from fires that originated in abandoned buildings owned by defendant city. Plaintiffs obtained class certification from the trial court, and defendants took issue. The court found that plaintiffs satisfied the threshold requirements for a class action, which were numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation. However, the court reversed because plaintiffs failed to meet any of three requirements under N.J. Ct. R. 4:32-1(b). First, the prosecution of separate actions would not have resulted in incompatible standards of conduct. Second, there was no showing that an adjudication of an individual case would, as a practical matter, dispose of other class members' claims, or that a single adjudication would have a dispositive impact involving a joint or common right. Third, the court found that questions of law or fact common to class members did not predominate over questions affecting individuals, or that a class action was superior to other means necessary for fair adjudication.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 59:9-2, for emotional distress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a former member of the New Jersey National Guard (Guard), was told by defendant sergeant in front of his company members that he had been discharged from the National Guard due to AIDS. Plaintiff filed suit under the New Jersey Tort Claims Act (NJTCA), N.J. Stat.

The court affirmed, and held that defendant sergeant's conduct was within the scope of his official duties, and that therefore he had immunity. Plaintiff did not have a claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 because his allegations were against defendant Army National Guard, which was not a &quot;person&quot; under the statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurance companies sought review of a judgment of the Commissioner of Insurance, State of New Jersey, Department of Insurance, which held that assessments under the Fair Automobile Insurance Reform Act of 1990, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 17:33B-1 to -63, applied to all Property Liability Insurance Guarantee Association members, and denied appellants' request for mandatory exemptions under N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurance companies sought a declaration of the Commissioner of Insurance that they were not subject to the assessments imposed by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:30A-8a(9). The commissioner held that assessments under the Fair Automobile Insurance Reform Act of 1990, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 17:33B-1 to -63, applied to all members of the Property Liability Insurance Guarantee Association members (PLIGA). On review, appellants contended that theses assessments were unfair, as appellants did not write automobile insurance, and were not servicing carriers of the New Jersey Full Insurance Underwriting Association (JUA). The court affirmed the decision of the Commissioner of Insurance and held that the impositions constituted a reasonable method of achieving an appropriate governmental objective, to relieve the JUA deficit. The fact that some members of the burdened class did not directly benefit from the JUA system was not sufficient to render the classification unreasonable or arbitrary. Also, it was not an unconstitutional taking of private property without compensation, because insurers were permitted a rate adjustment if necessary to assure a constitutionally adequate return.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant public entity appealed from a money judgment entered in favor of plaintiff high bidder in a public bidding case. Plaintiff filed a cross appeal of the denial of recovery concerning two additional bids. Defendant argued that the Buy-American provision in the Local Public Contracts law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:11-18, was unconstitutional. The court held that the monetary judgment must be reversed because plaintiff was not entitled to recover money damages even when its challenge to an award of a contract was successful. The court affirmed on the cross-appeal and reversed on the appeal because it did not need to address the statute's constitutionality once it reversed the money judgment and found that no equitable relief was feasible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of conspiracy under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:5-2, and murder under N.J. Stat.

Defendants argued that the indictment should have been vitiated due to prosecutorial interference, but the court found that evidence presented by the prosecutor was reasonable, and even if any statements had been erroneous, no prejudice had occurred. Defendants made a constitutional challenge to the death penalty statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court, Camden County (New Jersey), which imposed a custodial term with three years of parole ineligibility, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-7, based on defendant's probation violations. The state had waived the parole ineligibility term when defendant was initially sentenced for violating &sect; 2C:35-7, on the condition that defendant would comply with the terms of his probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to distribute within 1000 feet of school property, in violation of N.J.

Ann. &sect; 2C:35-12, the state agreed to waive the mandatory three-year parole ineligibility term fixed by &sect; 2C:35-7. In the plea agreement, the state specified that it would not waive the parole ineligibility term if defendant had to be resentenced for violating a condition of his probation. Defendant appealed the trial court's judgment, which imposed the parole ineligibility term on defendant after defendant pleaded guilty to violating his probation. The court determined that after the state waived the parole ineligibility term, &sect; 2C:35-12 could not be used to circumvent the sentencing guidelines established by case law. The court held that defendant was entitled to be resentenced on the probation violation in accordance with the standards set forth in the applicable case law without any mandatory period of parole ineligibility under &sect; 2C:35-7.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the New Jersey Builders Association, challenged a decision by respondent, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Regulation, to adopt new water quality management planning rules.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Regulation, adopted new water quality management planning rules. Appellant, the New Jersey Builders Association, challenged N.J. Admin. Code tit. 7, &sect;&sect; 15-4.1 and 14A-2.1(l),(m),(n) and (o), provided that applications for pollution discharge permits would not be issued unless a governmental body was either the sole or co-permittee. The court deleted the contested regulations, holding that respondent exceeded the scope of its authority. The court rejected respondent's argument that the regulations were necessary to insure proper oversight of the operations of domestic treatment works by experienced governmental bodies. The New Jersey Wastewater Treatment Privatization Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 58:27-1 et seq., had created the option to contract with private-sector firms for the operation of wastewater treatment systems. That the legislature had authorized reliance upon privatization was inconsistent with the co-permittee requirement, which sought to guarantee performance by private firms. The court stayed its deletion of the co-permittee requirements pending enactment of legislation that would implicitly ratify the regulations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed an order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Essex County (New Jersey), that suppressed cocaine evidence seized from defendant. Defendant had been driving a car, and a police officer heard loud music from the car and stopped the car for a violation of East Orange, N.J., Code &sect; 184-1. The cocaine was seized when defendant exited the car. Defendant was charged per N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2C:35-10a(1), 2C:35-5b(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was driving in his car, and he was stopped by the police. The basis of the stop was an alleged violation of East Orange, N.J., Code &sect; 184-1. Upon exiting the car, a police officer seized cocaine from defendant's pants. Defendant was charged for violations of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2C:35-10a(1), 2C:35-5b(3). In the trial court, defendant moved to suppress the cocaine evidence on the basis that &sect; 184-1 was void for vagueness. The trial court granted the motion. The state appealed. The court reversed. Section 184-1 outlawed unnecessary or unusually loud noise that either annoyed, injured, disturbed or endangered the comfort, health, repose, peace, or safety of others or which was so harsh, prolonged, or unusual in its use, time, and place as to annoy, disturb, or endanger the comfort, health, repose, peace, or safety of others. While temporarily on a roadway an electronic device could not be used to unreasonably annoy or disturb the quiet, comfort, peace, or repose of persons in public places. The court found that the terms of &sect; 184-1 enabled persons of common intelligence, in light of ordinary experience, to understand whether or not contemplated conduct was lawful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ruling in favor of the state, the court reversed the trial court's order that suppressed the cocaine evidence found on defendant. The court rejected defendant's contention that the ordinance on which the police stop was based was unconstitutionally vague and therefore void. The court found that the challenged provision fairly apprised the public and defendant of what it proscribed, and it was not void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review and attacked the constitutionality of the Act. On review, the court concluded that the provisions of the Act authorized the Commissioner to require appellant to cease writing other lines of insurance if it chose to withdraw from the private auto insurance market. The court did note that the Commissioner did overstep his authority by imposing restrictions on the ability of appellant's parent company to write life or health insurance as this was not within the purview of the Act.

Ann. &sect; 2C:35-7. After violating probation, he disputed the imposition of a sentence of five years in prison. The court held that, because defendant was properly advised at the time of plea about his maximum exposure and the mandatory term of his ineligibility for parole upon violation of probation, he had to receive the ineligibility term. However, the length of the ineligibility term depended upon the propriety of the specific term and the quantity of marijuana involved in the violation of &sect; 2C:35-7. That was not developed in the trial court when defendant entered his original guilty plea. Therefore, the court remanded for a determination of the specific term sentence based on consideration of the aggravating and mitigating factors and a determination of the appropriate ineligibility term based on that sentence and the quantity of marijuana involved.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporate property owner sought reversal of the judgment of the Superior Court, Burlington County (New Jersey), dismissing its complaint seeking to invalidate defendant township's bond ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporate property owner challenged a trial judge's order dismissing its complaint regarding defendant township's bond ordinances. The court affirmed. Defendant township had authorized the issuance of general obligation bonds to refinance its debt to another township. Plaintiff sought to block the issuance of those bonds, contending that defendant township had improperly issued them. The trial judge dismissed the complaint. In upholding the trial judge's decision, the court held that the debt payments made by defendant township, under a regional contribution agreement, were bondable under the Local Bond Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:2-1 et seq. In addition, the court held that a six-year period of repose was a proper useful life, not the 10-year period projected by defendant township; nevertheless, the proper remedy was to deem the maturation period for the bonds to be six years. Finally, the court held that the consideration paid by defendant township was related to a public purpose; thus, the bonds were valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the court below was modified and then affirmed. The bond ordinance covered a subject for which bonds could be issued, and the bonds were for a valid public purpose. The maturation date, however, was changed to six years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant offenders challenged the judgment that denied their motion to suppress evidence of detached American short lobster tails found in their possession in violation of N.J.

The agents requested and were granted permission to board and search for illegal lobsters. The tails were discovered in a wooden compartment. At trial, civil penalties were assessed against appellants. The court affirmed the judgment and held that one who was engaged in a regulated industry, such as the fishing industry, was on notice that periodic inspections would occur and had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the areas where he knew that inspections would occur. The court held that the search was authorized where there was reason to believe that a violation occurred within the meaning of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:10-20. The court also held that the search was valid under the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement because there was cause to believe that the evidence might be destroyed if the boat had been allowed to proceed unimpeded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner of Insurance (commissioner) ordered appellants, insurers who did not meet their quotas, to issue auto insurance policies to those who were at a high risk and were insured under the residual market through the Joint Underwriting Association after the legislature passed statutes replacing it with the Market Transition Facility. The court affirmed and reversed some issues that had not been settled prior to trial. The court affirmed the commissioner's order that first distributed those in underserved geographical areas because it responded to legitimate legislative concerns in a reasonable way that did not unfairly prejudice the insurers. The court reversed the commissioner's order that assigned producers because it contravened N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:33B-9c. The court affirmed the commissioner's order requiring one-year coverage. The court found that appellants had not shown either that they relied on a previous plan or that such reliance was justified and detrimental such as to create a protectable interest against change. The court also found that appellants did not make a sufficient case of unconstitutionality because the results of the plan could not be predicted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, industry and environmental groups, challenged regulations of respondent Department of Environmental Protection to enforce the Environmental Cleanup Responsibility Act (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 13:1K-6 to -14. The Act required industrial sites to clean up contamination as a precondition for the sale, transfer, or termination of operations at those facilities. Appellant industry groups claimed the regulations went beyond the Act and interfered with interstate commerce by regulating business transactions as opposed to dealing with the environment. The court held that protecting the public from contamination was a sufficiently compelling state interest to justify the minimal effect on interstate commerce. The court disallowed the regulations that dealt with certain issues, such as clean up of land adjacent to the industrial site, but as a whole conditionally approved all of the others if, on remand, N.J. Admin. Code tit. 7, &sect; 26B-1.9, was amended. The regulation, that permitted owners to seek waiver of the Act as too severe or unjust in their particular circumstances, was too vague.

Defendant contended that the trial court erred in allowing evidence of his prior drug convictions to be admitted at trial and that &sect; 2C:43-6f was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. Defendant's prior drug convictions were properly admitted because they had a bearing on defendant's credibility and were not so remote in time to be prejudicial. Section 2C:43-6f did not violate the separation of powers doctrine because it did not transfer the court's sentencing power to the state. The state had to apply for application of such section, but it was within the court's discretion to apply the section.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Bergen County, which, following a trial de novo on the record, found him guilty of consuming an alcoholic beverage while operating a motor vehicle in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:4-51a. A municipal court had previously found defendant guilty of the offense. Defendant was sentenced as a second offender to 10 days of community service and fined.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of consuming an alcoholic beverage while operating a motor vehicle in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:4-51a. A police officer came upon defendant's disabled car. During a conversation with defendant, the officer observed alcohol on defendant's breath and noted that defendant's eyes were somewhat red and watery. A passenger exited the car and the officer found two open, cold, beer cans that were half full inside the car. Defendant was sentenced to community service and fined pursuant to N.J. Stat.

The court found that state proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant violated &sect; 39:4-51a, as each element required for the presumption of a violation was established. The court held that the presumption created by &sect; 39:4-51a, that a person consumed an alcoholic beverage in violation of the statute where certain conditions were met, was legal. The court found that &sect; 39:4-51a was not unconstitutionally vague, either on its face or as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Council on Affordable Housing (New Jersey) granted substantive certification to a fair share plan for low income housing. Appellant public advocate challenged the downward adjustment based on insufficient vacant and developable land where a regional contribution agreement satisfied the obligation. Appellant Borough of Roseland contested respondent's interpretation of the occupancy preference under N. J. Admin Code tit. 5, &sect; 92-15.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant public advocate filed objections to the fair share plan proposed by appellant Borough of Roseland. Respondent Council on Affordable Housing determined the number of low housing units required by appellant borough to meet its fair share obligation and then made a downward adjustment based on the amount of vacant and developable land. On appeal of respondent's grant of substantive certification, appellant public advocate argued that because appellant borough had entered into a regional contribution agreement to satisfy its obligation, the downward adjustment was illegal. Noting statutory provisions that authorized several ways for the obligation to be met, the court held that once the share was determined, no recalculations were required regardless of the option selected. The court further held that the downward adjustment did not require an increase of units in other parts of the region. On appellant borough's proposed occupancy preference, the court held that N.J. Admin. Code tit. 5, &sect; 92-15.1 required the preference to be extended to both local residents and workers. Rejecting appellants' challenge, the court affirmed respondent's grant of substantive certification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed respondent affordable housing council's grant of substantive certification to appellant borough's fair share plan. The court rejected appellant public advocate's claim that the downward adjustment to the required number of units was not justified by appellant's borough choice of a regional contribution agreement to meet its obligation and affirmed respondent's interpretation of the occupancy preference statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant public advocate challenged appellee City of Warren's Fair Share Housing Plan claiming it was unconstitutional because it had not provided a reasonable opportunity for lower income families to build homes. It also claimed that it was improper for the Council on Affordable Housing (COAH), to not refer appellee's petition to the Office of Administrative Law as was required by N.J. Admin. Code tit. 315(c) &sect; 52:27D, and that it was error to adopt the plan without first complying with administrative rulemaking procedures. The court held that appellees' plan had not violated the standards, and it affirmed. It found that although appellant's asserted both a direct challenge under N.J. Admin. Code tit. 14.2 &sect; 5:92-15, and a collateral challenge on the validity of appellee's regulations, neither were sustainable. It held both that COAH had the authority to adjudicate, and that no contested case existed because no dispute as to underlying data existed, so that an evidentiary hearing was not mandated under the code.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his convictions by the Superior Court of New Jersey, Passaic County (New Jersey), for second-degree possession of cocaine and possession of cocaine near a school. Defendant challenged the admissibility of the certified laboratory report under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-19(c) and the failure to properly instruct the jury on the weight of the cocaine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police arrested defendant after observing a drug deal. An analysis of the contents of retrieved vials showed sufficient weight to charge defendant with a second-degree possession offense. Before jury selection, defendant requested the trial court to exclude the certified laboratory report because it did not detail how the vials were weighed. The prosecution responded that defendant failed to give timely notice of objection as required under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-19(c). The trial court admitted the report. On appeal of his convictions, defendant challenged the validity of &sect; 2C:35-19(c) contending that the legislature was without power to enact a rule of evidence. The court held that &sect; 2C:35-19(c) established a procedure for stipulating admission of the report, but was not a rule of evidence that interfered with judicial prerogatives. Because the jury was not instructed to determine whether the amount of cocaine defendant possessed included a sufficient amount of free base, the court affirmed only the three-degree possession near the school conviction and reversed the second-degree conviction remanding for new trial or new sentencing on a lesser third-degree conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a township, the township planning board, a mayor, and a municipal council, sought review of a decision of a trial court (New Jersey), which held that a &quot;steep slope&quot; ordinance and a zoning ordinance that imposed two-acre minimum lot size in a zone occupied by a tract of land could not be applied in reviewing a preliminary subdivision proposal submitted by respondent developer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants contended that the trial court incorrectly refused to apply the time of decision doctrine when it considered the municipal ordinance. Appellants had amended their zoning ordinance after the developer had set forth litigation against them. The trial court found that the amendments unfairly burdened the developer and rendered useless much of the judicial time that had been spent on the case. The trial court further found that the developer was not required to deal with changing rules which were at least in part a response to the developer's successful litigation. Thus, the trial judge relied upon the special equities exception. The court held that the trial court erred. The record did not show that appellants arbitrarily or capriciously changed the zoning ordinance to frustrate the express grant of a use or subdivision approval by a court in prior litigation. To the contrary, there were valid reasons for the zoning at issue. After weighing the issues, the court held that the zoning ordinance at the time of the decision should have been applied because it would not have undermined existing special equities without accomplishing any offsetting service to the public interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions from the Superior Court, Gloucester County (New Jersey) of fourth degree aggravated assault, fourth degree possession of a prohibited weapon, third degree possession of a handgun without a permit, and second degree possession of a handgun for an unlawful purpose. Defendant argued that the sentencing statute&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:43-6.2, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of fourth degree aggravated assault, N.J. Stat.

Plaintiff opposed the application and the judge declined to entertain the application. The court affirmed defendant's convictions and concluded that N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant recycling centers challenged an administrative action of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (board). The action ordered appellants not to resume operation of its solid waste transfer station, ordered a center without a certificate to cease collecting solid waste, ordered appellants to immediately comply with all waste order and rules, and imposed penalties for the unlicensed operation of a transfer station. Appellants argued that evidence did not support the decision. The court affirmed the decision of the board and held such order would be upheld in the absence of evidence that the board was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable, that it was supported by the evidence, and that it did not violate legislative policies expressed or fairly implied in the statutory scheme administered by the board. The court found that appellants were transfer stations, not recycling centers, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:13A-6(a) did not violate the Commerce Clause because waste disposal was a matter or state concern and the statute imposed only incidental effects on interstate commerce, and the penalties provide for in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:13A-12(b) did not constitute criminal punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities against appellant recycling centers was affirmed because it was not arbitrary or capricious. The statute regulating appellants was constitutional because it was not ex post facto and its affect on interstate commerce was only incidental. The court also held that the statute regulating appellants did not constitute criminal punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff administratrix sought review of a decision which granted summary judgment to defendant national guardsmen, on plaintiff's claim for injuries sustained to her husband while riding in an armored personnel carrier during a national guard training exercise. Plaintiff's husband was injured in 1978 and committed suicide in 1987. During the pendency of the litigation, the legislature enacted N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38A:13-1.2, which eliminated the liability of the state, national guard, and its members for injury or death that occurred in the line of duty, except as provided under the military compensation law and except for injury or death that was due to an intentionally wrongful act by a national guardsman. The statute applied to all actions and proceedings that accrued, were pending, or were filed after June 1, 1986. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to defendant guardsmen and held that the legislature had the power to wipe out a claim that existed under a prior statute at any time prior to entry of a final judgment. The court held that it did not violate due process to apply the statute retroactively.</SPAN></P>

The trial court enjoined the defendant from appointing class IV and alternate members without the advice and consent of the city council and invalidated the three class IV members and two alternates appointed by the defendant. The court affirmed because it found no basis for finding any legislative language, policy or history sufficient to evidence an intent to repeal the charter provisions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled dangerous substance, possession of a controlled dangerous substance with intent to distribute, and possession of a controlled dangerous substance with intent to distribute within 1,000 feet of school property, N.J.

Defendant challenged the conviction and asserted that statements he made were inadmissible and that &sect; 2C:35-7 was unconstitutional. On appeal the court affirmed the conviction and held that &sect; 2C:35-7 did not violate double jeopardy provisions because &sect; 2C:35-7 was specifically prohibited from merging with &sect; 2C:35-5(a)(1). The court concluded that the double jeopardy argument was not applicable because it prohibited retrials after an acquittal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried and convicted by a jury for the crime of third-degree unlawful possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, a violation of N.

At trial, the prosecution used a map drawn up by city engineers, to show that the situs of the crime was within the required distance to a school. The court received the map as prima facie evidence, after it had been properly authenticated, because an amendment to N. J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-7 authorized such an action. After he was convicted, he appealed based upon ex post facto constitutional violations because the amendment was not in place at the time he committed the crime. The court affirmed his conviction, finding that the amendment was only a change to the evidentiary rules. Because the amendment did not create the crime of which defendant was convicted, nor did it increase the punishment for the crime or deprive defendant of a defense that was available when he committed it, it passed constitutional muster in not violating ex post facto prohibitions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant seatbelt manufacturer appealed an order of the Superior Court, Passaic County (New Jersey), which denied its motion for summary judgment under the statute of limitations, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:14-2, and sustained the constitutionality of the tolling statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:14-22, which was defended on appeal by the attorney general, not plaintiff driver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff driver filed suit against defendant seatbelt manufacturer and others for injuries she suffered in an automobile accident when her seatbelt broke. Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment under the statute of limitations, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:14-2. The trial court denied that motion, holding that the tolling provision of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:14-22, applicable to foreign defendants, was constitutional and applied. On interlocutory appeal, the attorney general rather than plaintiff defended, and asked the court to interpret &sect; 2A:14-22 so as to satisfy the requirements of the Commerce Clause. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment that &sect; 2A:14-22, as amended, was constitutional, holding that it violated the Commerce Clause. However, the court held that because its determination of unconstitutionality was prospective only as of the date of a United States Supreme Court decision, the statute of limitations did not commence running against defendant until June 17, 1988. Therefore, the two-year statute of limitations had not run when the amended complaint naming defendant was filed. Therefore, the court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought an interlocutory appeal of a decision by the trial judge of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Bergen County, when the trial judge refused its motion for further discovery regarding hypnosis evidence to be presented by defendant regarding multiple personality disorder in an insanity defense. The trial judge based his decision on the fact that the state had not yet conducted its psychiatric examination of defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant intended to introduce evidence of multiple personalities in an insanity defense case using testimony under hypnosis. The state filed a motion with the court requesting further discovery of the hypnosis methods used by defendant and the trial court denied the motion, finding that the state had not yet done its own psychiatric examination of defendant. The state appealed the denial of the motion and the court affirmed the denial. The court found that the procedural safeguards regarding the use of hypnotically enhanced evidence should apply to defendant, but that the taped evidence requested by the state should not be given because the state's psychiatric examination was not yet performed. However, the state was entitled to other psychiatric and medical records.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court regarding further discovery by the state of the hypnosis testimony of defendant, finding that the state must first complete its psychiatric examination of defendant, and remanded the case. The court further found that the state was entitled to other medical and psychiatric records of defendant and defendant's counsel was ordered to turn over such to the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted on one count of third-degree conspiracy, N.J. Stat.

While working on satisfying the conditions of entry, the acceptance into the program was withdrawn by the prosecutor and defendant went to trial and was convicted of more charges under a new indictment. Defendant sought review of the prosecutor's withdrawal of acceptance. The court reversed the convictions and remanded the case with the order to allow defendant to participate in PTI. The court found that it was erroneous for the prosecutor to withdraw the acceptance because of a change in prosecutor, as defendant had relied upon the acceptance into the program.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, petitioner sought review, contending that &sect; 34:15-36 was unconstitutional. On review, the court affirmed respondent's award. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional in that the statutory limitation placed upon application of the odd lot doctrine bore a reasonable and just relationship to the general object of the legislation, that is, cost containment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant borough made an agreement with defendant developer to amend a zoning ordinance to allow commercial development more intensive than otherwise permitted in exchange for $ 2.5 million and certain land from developer to the borough. The land and money was to be used to help satisfy the borough's obligation to provide low and moderate income housing and was conditioned on certification and enactment by the borough of zoning ordinance amendments. The court dismissed the claim that certification did not provide a realistic opportunity for construction of affordable housing, holding that plaintiffs did not have standing as neighboring landowners and taxpayers to make such a claim; housing rights of low and moderate income persons could only be asserted by the persons themselves. The court also allowed other charges against the borough holding that the Fair Housing Act did not diminish the constitutionally protected right to challenge municipal conduct by actions in lieu of prerogative writs. The Council on Affordable Housing was not granted power by legislature to hear actions challenging municipal action and the action should properly be heard in the Law Division.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant woman's club appealed a ruling of the tax court in favor of plaintiff town denying a local property tax exemption under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-3.52. On appeal, the court reversed the tax court ruling because it found &sect; 54:4-3.52 was constitutional as written by the legislature. The statute had only two requirements for exemption: ownership by a non-profit corporation and certification as an historical cite. The tax court added a use requirement not embodied in the statute. The court wrestled with whether the tax court allowed for the possibility that an exemption could be achieved without constitutional amendment when the statute advanced purposes generally beneficial to society as a whole. The court concluded that the exemption made a substantial distinction that had a logical and reasonable basis premised on the public purpose and works of a non-profit corporation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court admitted defendant's refusal into evidence and ordered him imprisoned. On appeal, the court determined the statute was not unconstitutionally vague, but that the court-ordered blood test was a search under U.S. Const. amend.

The court never reached the question of whether defendant was properly imprisoned, but held that the lower court could incarcerate a litigant who refused to submit to a court-ordered blood test and that such refusal gave rise to a presumption the results would have been unfavorable to him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner sought review of a summary judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Atlantic County (New Jersey), granted in favor of respondent Council on Affordable Housing in appellant's suit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner sued respondent Council on Affordable Housing. Respondent council joined respondent Cherry Hill Township to the suit. Appellant had acres in respondent township. Respondent council, using the power given to it under Fair Housing Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:27D-301 et seq. and N.J. Admin. Code tit. 5, &sect; 91-11.1, issued an order stopping respondent township from giving any approval for development of lots of two acres or more. This freeze on development lasted 18 months and affected appellant's property. Appellant's suit was for damages for an unconstitutional taking of his affected property. Appellant relied on U.S. Const. amend. V, XIV; N.J. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. The trial court granted summary judgment to respondent council. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed. The court held that the imposing of a moratorium for a reasonable time on land development based on environmental and other public interest considerations did not equal a temporary taking. Without extraordinary delay, there was no taking because of decreases in the value of property while government deliberated; the decreases were incidents of ownership. The court found no unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged the trial court's order that dismissed a three-count indictment against respondent corporation and owner for theft from deceptive fund raising.

The court reversed, remanded, and noted that an indictment could not be dismissed except on the clearest ground. The court found that the state's comments to the grand jury that explained expected testimony of a witness and how it fit in a complicated case did not infringe on the grand jury's independent judgment because the grand jury was admonished not to take the state's comments as evidence. The court found that the offenses that were allegedly committed by respondents were multiple thefts that were the result of one common scheme and the amounts could have been aggregated pursuant to N.J.

The court held that the period of repose provided by the statute began when appellant submitted his designs and provided no supervision on a project, ten years and one day after the delivery of his plans to an independent contractor-developer.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction in the trial court that was entered upon his plea bargain of causing the drug induced death of his girlfriend in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-9 and his sentence of 10 year's imprisonment, and asserted that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated appellant's due process rights and exceeded the legislature's power to create a strict liability statute. The court affirmed and determined that the transferred intent of the statute was modeled on the felony murder law. The court noted that all reported challenges to the constitutionality of a felony murder statute have been rejected. The court held that the legislature found that the manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of cocaine were inherently dangerous criminal activities that posed dangers to others, and appellant failed to show any basis that the legislature's determination was irrational. The court held that the statute applied only to deaths that were proximate consequences of dangerous illegal activities and did not violate due process of law. The court held that appellant's sentence conformed to contemporary standards of decency and was not cruel or unusual.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contemnor sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Mercer County, that denied appellant's motion for an evidentiary hearing to determine the effectiveness of appellant's continued incarceration for civil contempt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contemnor was brought before the lower court after he refused to testify in grand jury proceedings where appellant had been granted immunity. The lower court held appellant in civil contempt and ordered appellant to remain in custody until such time as appellant agreed to purge himself of the contempt by testifying. A few weeks into the incarceration, appellant filed a motion for an evidentiary hearing, which the lower court denied. Appellant also sought review of the type of protective custody he was placed under, complaining that it was punishment. The court affirmed the lower court's order denying appellant's request for an evidentiary hearing and approved of the protective custody afforded to appellant. The court held that in the early phase of a civil contempt commitment, it would defer to the lower court's assessment of whether a hearing was necessary to determine if the incarceration was being used to coerce the desired action or whether the incarceration was punishment. The court held that the method of protective custody used was appropriate. The conditions complained of were those normally incidental to confinement and were not purposely designed to punish.</SPAN></P>

Appellee contended that during the execution of the search warrant appellants intentionally inflicted emotional distress and maliciously converted property. Appellants moved for summary judgment, and the trial court denied appellants' motions because appellee's version of facts constituted enough evidence that appellants' conduct was not reasonable. Appellants challenged the trial court's order. The court affirmed the denial of summary judgment, as to appellants police officers, because there were outstanding issues of fact as to whether or not appellants police officers acted unreasonably during their search, which had to be determined by a plenary hearing. The court reversed the trial court's order denying appellant superintendent summary judgment, however, because he was not present during the search and was entitled to immunity as a matter of law with respect to the seizure of appellee's property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant sought review of a decision of the Superior Court, Middlesex County (New Jersey), which entered judgment convicting defendant of three drug-related offenses in violation of N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in a three-count indictment with third degree possession of a controlled dangerous substance, cocaine, with intent to distribute, contrary to N.J.

The lower court convicted defendant on all three counts. For sentencing purposes, count three and count one were merged and defendant was given concurrent sentences. Defendant challenged the judgment and sentence. The appellate court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The appellate court agreed with defendant that his conviction under &sect;&sect; 2C:35-5a(1) and b(3) should have merged into his conviction under &sect; 2C:35-7 and that anti-merger language in &sect; 2C:35-7 did not bar such a result. The appellate court held that any scheme of multiple punishments for a single crime violated deeply imbedded notions of substantive due process and fundamental fairness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment convicting defendant of three drug-related offenses was affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant municipality challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Camden County (New Jersey), which held that portions of a rent control ordinance were unconstitutional after plaintiff landlord challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord was the managing agent of an apartment complex. After fire destroyed some of the units in the complex, plaintiff totally reconstructed them. Plaintiff applied for a periodic increase in rents for the apartment complex.

Defendant township reversed the board's decision on the ground that plaintiff's renovated or reconstructed units could not, as a matter of law, qualify as initial rentals under a rent control ordinance. Thereafter, plaintiff filed an action against defendant seeking a judgment declaring that several sections of the ordinance were unconstitutional. The trial court granted summary judgment to plaintiff. On appeal, the court held that the ordinance met the legitimate goals of safeguarding tenants against excessive rent increases. The ordinance satisfied federal and state equal protection guarantees. There was no evidence presented that the ordinance impaired plaintiff's ability to recover a fair return. Hence, the judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of various drug charges and for engaging in prohibited conduct near a school. He challenged his conviction on the ground that the non-merger provision of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-7 violated the prohibitions against double jeopardy under U.S. Const. amend V, and N.J. Const. art. I, para. II. He also argued that the fines assessed against him violated N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-15.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a sentence he received in connection with his drug related conviction. He challenged the sentence, among other reasons, on the ground that the non-merger provision of N.Y. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-7 violated U.S. Const. amend. V, and N.J. Const. art. I, para. II. He also argued that the fines assessed against him violated N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-15. The appellate court reduced the amount of the fine and otherwise affirmed the judgment. The court observed that an element of the &sect; 2C:35-7 crime was prohibited conduct near a school, which was not an element of the N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-5 of which defendant was convicted. Moreover, the &sect; 2C:35-5 crimes did not include as an element prohibited conduct near a school. The non-merger provision was therefore not offensive and, in fact, the non-merger provision of &sect; 2C:35-7 was not necessary to prevent merger anyway. The court agreed with defendant that the fines assessed by the trial court did not comply with N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-15, and remanded the case for an appropriate reduction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the fine defendant was assessed but otherwise affirmed defendant's drug charge conviction. The court rejected defendant's argument that the non-merger provision of one of the statutes under which he was convicted subjected him to double jeopardy. The court found that since the crime it defined had a different element from the others there would have been no merger in any event.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Health Care Facilities Planning Act (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:2H-1 et seq., respondent New Jersey State Department of Health Hospital Rate Setting Commission set the allowable hospital rates in the state. Petitioner claimed respondent erroneously considered the labor component when it set the rates. Petitioner contended that respondent's decision violated the Administrative Procedures Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:14B-2(e), and respondent did not have the authority to grant statewide increases in the labor component. On appeal, the court modified the decision, then affirmed. Respondent was required to take the Bureau of Labor Statistics' rate of inflation in force at the time respondent took final action under N.J. Admin. Code tit. 8, &sect; 31B-3.72(a)(1), so the court modified the order to reflect such rate. Respondent had the authority to grant statewide increases under the Act because the Act allowed respondent to consider common issues and consolidate cases involving common issues.

While at the center, defendant took a guard hostage by holding a shank to him and claimed that he wanted to escape. Defendant was subsequently convicted of attempted escape, possession of implements of escape, and criminal restraint of a correction officer. Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that defendant had the burden of proving by a preponderance of evidence that he suffered from a mental disease under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:4-2. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The jury instruction was incorrect because once defendant came forward with evidence of a mental disease, the burden of disproving such disease fell upon the state. The error was harmless though because there was no competent evidence that defendant suffered from a mental disease, which would have negated the knowing element of the attempted escape offense. In addition, the evidence against defendant was overwhelming.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate was injured when she dove into a prison swimming pool. She brought an action against the state seeking damages for her injuries. The state filed third-party claims against third-party defendants, manufacturers, and later amended its claims to add a direct claim for medical costs. The trial court granted partial summary judgment to third-party defendants on the state's claims, and issued rulings limiting the state's right to contribution on comparative negligence grounds. The state sought review of its decision. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court stated that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59:9-2b, which barred recovery against a public entity for strict products liability, afforded no basis for barring such recovery in favor of a public entity, and that the state's claim for contribution need not assert the same theory of liability as plaintiff's claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found respondent hospital 20 percent negligent in appellant executor-survivor's wrongful death and survival action that arose from the death of his wife. Because respondent's liability was limited by the charitable immunity statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:53A-8, the judgment against respondent was limited to $ 10,000. Appellant sought review, and the court affirmed. The court rejected appellant's contention that the statute, as applied to hospitals, was special legislation and violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the United States Constitution. The constitutionality of the statute was well settled. The court also rejected appellant's contention that the statute was inapplicable because his wife's care was paid for by medical insurance. The fact of insurance did not change the impact of the statute or confer additional rights upon an injured beneficiary; every user of a non-profit hospital was a beneficiary of its works. The court held that the trial court properly ruled that respondent could not be treated as an equipment lessor to whom strict liability applied.

The court held that plaintiff could not assert personal claims of the creditors and policyholders. The court found that the creditors and policyholders could bring separate causes of action for their personal claims against defendants.

Appellant raised constitutional challenges to certain parts of the Comprehensive Drug Reform Act of 1986, N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a plea agreement, appellant pleaded guilty to four counts of distribution of drugs, two counts of possession of drugs with intent to distribute, and two counts of possession of drugs.

Appellant sought review, and the court reversed the merger order, remanded for resentencing on those offenses, and otherwise affirmed the convictions and prison sentences. The court held that the trial judge erred by merging the convictions, and by imposing a mandatory laboratory fee on only two convictions, but rejected appellant's constitutional challenges.

The court did not agree with the lower court that the record did not support an analysis under another New Jersey appellate decision because the structures as described by the judge in the appellate decision relied on by the court resembled those in plaintiffs' applications far more than those in the two case precedents, which the court rejected. The court was satisfied that defendant properly distinguished the two disfavored case precedents from the applications before it and properly ruled that plaintiffs were not entitled to a subdivision without a variance.

The court held that the legislature clearly intended to sanction multiple convictions and punishment upon simultaneous convictions for possession with intent to distribute heroin and for doing it within 1,000 feet of school property, and the court upheld that intent.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, as mother and guardian for infant children, appealed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant insurance company. Plaintiff and infant children were injured in an automobile accident and filed claims against defendant. Defendant's claim representative requested that plaintiffs attend physical examinations. Plaintiff's attorney reminded defendant's claim representative that plaintiffs were represented by counsel, objected to correspondence sent directly to plaintiffs, and requested information concerning the doctor's field of medicine. The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. After arguments, the motion judge denied plaintiffs' application, but granted the defendant's motion. On appeal, the court agreed with much stated by the motion judge, but reversed the dismissal. The court found that plaintiff did not come forward with the proofs necessary to sustain a challenge. The court held that rather than affirming the dismissal of the complaint, it remanded so that plaintiff could come forward within 30 days with a sufficient showing that there was a qualified physician in closer proximity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his guilty plea for driving while intoxicated, defendant appealed an interlocutory order of the Matawan Municipal Court (New Jersey), denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained at a roadblock. Defendant claimed that the sobriety checkpoint violated his rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV and N.J. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, because it was not justified by empirical data showing the public's safety warranted the checkpoint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested at a sobriety checkpoint on the highway. He pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated after the trial court denied his motion to suppress evidence based on the illegality of the roadblock. On appeal, defendant challenged that the checkpoint violated his rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV and N.J. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 because it was not justified by empirical data showing that the public's safety warranted the checkpoint. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that the checkpoint was a properly targeted location that was efficacious, and that a rational basis existed for the site selection. Therefore, the warrantless stopping of defendant's vehicle that led to the discovery of his intoxicated condition was reasonable under U.S. Const. amend. IV and N.J. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. Because the state sustained the burden of proving the validity of the seizure, the trial court's order denying the motion to suppress was affirmed, and the judgment of conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's conviction of defendant for driving while intoxicated. The court held that defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained when he was arrested at a sobriety checkpoint was properly denied because a rational basis existed for the roadblock. Therefore it did not violate defendant's Fourth Amendment rights or his rights under the New Jersey Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought suit under the Conscientious Employee Protection Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:19-1 to 34:19-8, alleging that defendants demoted plaintiff due to plaintiff's objection to defendant's unauthorized use of confidential transcripts to obtain trade secrets. Defendants argued that they were entitled to an implied exception under the Act, because of plaintiff's status as an in-house attorney. Defendants argued that the Act unconstitutionally impinged on the New Jersey Supreme Court's plenary and exclusive power to regulate the practice of law. The court rejected this argument, holding that the &quot;force of the statute&quot; could be accommodated to the allegedly conflicting ethical principle. The court also rejected defendants' argument that the Act violated the separation of powers doctrine, because the Act served an important purpose which was clearly within New Jersey's police powers. The attorney-client privilege asserted by defendants did not apply because of the alleged commission of a crime by defendants.</SPAN></P>

She sought a judgment declaring the CCA unconstitutional in that it interfered with her rights under U.S. Const. amend.

The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss or for summary judgment. The court on appeal affirmed, holding that: the state had a compelling interest in preventing corruption by the casino industry and a broad prohibition on all political contributions from casino key employees was necessary to achieve that interest; the CCA was narrowly tailored only to casino key employees; the terms &quot;thing of value&quot; and &quot;professional services&quot; were well known and defined such that it was clear what conduct was prohibited; and legal services were a &quot;thing of value.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a determination of the Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) that suspended the driver's license of appellant driver for a one-year period due to appellant's epilepsy. The court held that the nature of appellant's seizure's required the suspension of his driving privileges under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:3-10. The time frame between onset of a seizure and unconsciousness was too short and appellant's seizures were not controlled. The court was concerned over the wording and application of N.J. Admin. Code tit 13, &sect; 19-5.7 governing review of suspensions of licenses based on epilepsy by a special neurological disorder committee, but found that appellant's case had been considered and decided on an individualized basis. Appropriate consideration had been given as to whether appellant could drive an automobile without significant risk to himself or others. The court found valid the presumption that a person who had not been seizure free for one-year prior to a license suspension was not sufficiently controlled to permit that person to drive. The one-year suspension period was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

Defendant and his girlfriend met with state police on numerous occasions, and arranged an eavesdropping device in the luncheonette.

Defendant also testified that he and his girlfriend had not met with state police. Defendant was subsequently convicted of perjury under N.J. Stat.

Defendant appealed, contending that materiality, as an element of the offense of perjury, should have been submitted to the jury for final determination rather than being allocated to the trial court. The court affirmed the conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Juvenile was adjudicated delinquent for the offense of conspiracy to distribute cocaine. The court assessed a penalty of $ 1,000, six-month postponement of driving privileges, and a $ 25 forensic laboratory fee which the juvenile challenged. The court reversed the penalties, holding that they did not apply to conspiracy to commit a drug violation. The court held that the legislature did not intend to include the crime of conspiracy under the Comprehensive Drug Reform Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-1. The fact that the object of the conspiracy was a crime under the Act, or that conspiracy was graded in accordance with crimes for which the penalties could be imposed was not sufficient to support the theory that conspiracy alone constituted an offense under the act for which mandatory penalties applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the imposing of penalties because conspiracy was not an offense defined under statute for which mandatory penalties could be imposed.

Appellant contended that appellee insurance association was a successor to the Automobile Insurance Plan, and that he had a statutory right to full annual commissions upon cancellation of the policies. In affirming the lower court's dismissal of his complaint, the court held that appellee was entitled to have the complaint dismissed as a matter of law because the legislature, in enacting subdivisions j and k to &sect; 17:22-6.14a, intended that commissions for unearned premiums were not to be paid for policies that were cancelled for nonpayment. The court found a clear legislative expression of intent to apply the amendment retroactively. The court stated that retroactive application would not cause any manifest injustice to appellant. The court stated that &sect; 17:22-6.14a and its amendments did not result in harsh or oppressive consequences, did not tread on vested rights, and did not violate the due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant pleaded guilty and was convicted of maintaining a premises as a house of prostitution. Defendant claimed that her conviction was invalid because the statutes were unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court found that the statutes were not vague because a female employee offered to remove her clothing, sit on the lap of a male customer, and masturbate him to orgasm in exchange for a fee. This conduct constituted sexual activity. The court also held that the applicable statutes were not constitutionally overbroad. The statutes enforced against defendant did not impinge upon any U.S. Const. amend. I rights. Sexual activity for money was not protected by a constitutional right to privacy or a state-granted right to privacy. The court found no danger that the statutes would be used to penalize private consensual sexual activity.

Ann. &sect; 2C:30-2 after he allegedly accepted a fee for removing tenants as constable, knowing that he was not permitted to do so. On appeal, the court reversed and dismissed the indictment. Expert opinion testimony on matters of domestic law should not have been admitted, and the expert witness, as the chief judge of the vicinage, should not have been allowed to testify. Given the weight of his judicial office, his testimony as to the nature of the office of constable, its scope, and responsibilities was tremendously harmful. The law of defendant's duties in tenant removals was so uncertain that it was presented to the jury as a matter of disputed fact. That degree of uncertainty showed that the law did not give a person of ordinary intelligence fair warning of what conduct was proscribed, thus, it was fundamentally unfair to subject defendant to a criminal prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant limited partnership owned an apartment complex that was to be converted into a cooperative and filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the Cooperative Recording Act of New Jersey (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46:8D-1 et seq. The trial court held that the Act was constitutional and granted summary judgment to respondent New Jersey Department of Community Affairs. On appeal, the court reversed as to a revenue-raising transfer tax imposed solely on post-Act cooperatives because it violated equal protection. Only the costs associated with maintaining public recording facilities could be properly assessed against post-Act cooperatives by taxation; the case was remanded for determination of that amount. The court affirmed the rest of the judgment because the Act was reasonably related to a legitimate legislative purpose and was not arbitrary or discriminatory. Even if N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46:8D-2 was deemed to impose duplicate taxation, the legislature was constitutionally empowered to enact such a statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was charged with various drug violations, he was accepted into the pretrial intervention (PTI) program. Defendant was then required to pay a mandatory Drug Enforcement and Demand Reduction (DEDR) penalty as a condition to admission to the PTI program. Subsequently, defendant sought a judicial declaration that the portion of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-15 mandating DEDR penalties was unconstitutional. The court held that the DEDR penalties were not punitive in nature where they served a general rehabilitative and preventive function and, therefore, the penalties could be imposed absent a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court further found that the imposition of DEDR penalties did not violate substantive due process because the law requiring the penalties was not unreasonable or arbitrary where it sought to serve a general rehabilitative or preventive function. Finally, the court held that imposition of DEDR penalties did not violate equal protection where N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-15d and e provided an avenue whereby a person unable to pay a DEDR penalty may gain admission into, or avoid termination from, PTI. As such, the court affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent New Jersey Racing Commission, pursuant to a violation of N.J. Admin Code tit. 13, &sect; 71-20.10(b), suspended appellant harness driver for 30 days for unsatisfactory driving due to lack of effort. Appellant sought review and an administrative law judge (ALJ) affirmed appellant's suspension. Appellant challenged the decision, contending that the regulation was unconstitutionally vague, that his due process rights were violated during initial hearings, that he was not given adequate notice of exceptions to the ALJ's recommendations, that the ALJ had improperly denied appellant 's presentation of his prior testimony at trial, and that his 30 day suspension was not warranted. The court affirmed and held that the language of the regulation was not so vague that a person of ordinary intelligence was unable to discern what was required, that appellant's due process allegations were answered by his trial de novo before the ALJ, that appellant should have been served with timely notice, but that the error was harmless because he had already filed written exceptions to respondent's findings, and that the regulations had only permitted a suspension of 10 days.</SPAN></P>

The state appealed from the order merging defendant's conviction for escape.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of felony murder, N.J. Stat. Ann. 2C:11-3a(3), first-degree robbery, N.J.

Case law obligated the trial court to conclude that, because defendant did not avail himself of state-appointed counsel, he could not receive state-funded expert services to assist in his defense. The court rejected this notion and held that under N.J. Stat. Ann. 2A:158A-14 defendant did not have to be represented by a public defender to receive the state's services because the right to such services hinged only on defendant's indigent status. However, the trial court's decision to deny state-funded services was still correct because the facts of the case did not warrant such services. The matter was remanded for resentencing based on the state's cross-appeal because the trial court erred in merging defendant's escape conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of New Jersey, which convicted him under one indictment of possession of cocaine and possession of that substance with intent to distribute and under another indictment of possession of cocaine, and distribution of cocaine. Defendant was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment made consecutive to any violation of parole and 5 years imprisonment, consecutive to the prior sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following his guilty plea, defendant was convicted on two indictments of various drug offenses. He was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment on the first indictment and to 5 years, consecutive to the prior sentence on the second indictment. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment of sentence but remanded the cause for further proceedings on defendant's application for sentencing under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:1-1c(2), because the trial court mistakenly exercised his discretion by denying his application on the grounds stated. The court determined that although defendant had no right to be sentenced under the Comprehensive Drug Reform Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2C:35-1 et seq., his request should have been generally granted by the trial court, because the trial court did not find expressly state good cause to deny defendant's request. The court concluded that if defendant desired to be sentenced under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:1-1c(2), and his application was granted, the state would be given an opportunity to make any appropriate application for extended terms treatment and defendant would be subject to any mandatory sentencing provisions required under N.J.

Further, the court held that respondent chiropractor was required to comply with N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:6A-13 because his services were the subject of respondent insured's medical expenses claim.

Defendants argued that the policy's territorial restriction was impermissible under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:28-1.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant driver was injured when he was struck by an uninsured vehicle in British West Indies. Defendant driver was named as an additional insured in defendant insured's policy. Plaintiff insurer denied a claim to arbitrate damages for bodily injury because uninsured motorist (UM) coverage under the policy did not extend beyond the United States, its territories or possessions, or Canada. In a declaratory action to enforce the territorial restriction, plaintiff was granted summary judgment on the ground that the restriction was permitted under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:28-1.1. On appeal, defendants argued that &sect; 17:28-1.1 should not have been interpreted to permit the restriction. The court disagreed, finding that the plain language of &sect; 17:28-1.1 mandated UM coverage only within the United States and Canada. The court affirmed the summary judgment for plaintiff holding that the restriction was enforceable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff estate of decedent filed a New Jersey inheritance tax return. A statement for direct taxes assessed was sent along with a suggested compromise tax on the contingent remainder in the life estate of decedent's widow. The Tax Court affirmed the compromise tax and found the use of gender-based mortality tables in evaluation of the remainder life estate unconstitutional because it discriminated against women. Cross motions for summary judgment were heard on the compromise tax assessed and on the finding that the statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the compromise tax, finding it was proper to base the compromise agreement on the tax rates at the time of decedent's death, and not on the rate in effect at the date of the distribution of the remainder interest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile and two minor females bought heroin and smoked marijuana cigarettes laced with the heroin. Defendant and one female abandoned the second female on train tracks where she had collapsed, and she was eventually struck and killed by a train. Defendant was charged in juvenile court with possession of heroin; possession of heroin with intent to distribute; distribution of heroin; and causing a drug-induced death. The juvenile court waived jurisdiction so that defendant could be tried as an adult. The court affirmed, holding that the lower court properly concluded that there was probable cause to believe that defendant knowingly or purposely distributed heroin to the decedent in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-5, and that defendant's distribution of the drug to the decedent was the cause of her death under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-9b. The court found that the lower court reasonably could have found that defendant did not meet his burden of establishing the probability of his rehabilitation prior to attaining the age of 19. The court held that defendant failed to preserve his challenges to the constitutionality and applicability of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-9.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent developer applied to respondent city for a tax abatement under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 55:14K-37(b). Respondent city held public meetings regarding the abatement and later adopted a resolution granting the abatement. Respondent developer entered into financing agreements with the New Jersey Housing Mortgage and Finance Agency and the agreements incorporated N.J. Admin. Code tit. 5, &sect; 80-3.3. Appellants, township and town, challenged the tax abatement and argued that it violated N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3, par. 1. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment of respondents, city, developer, and tax board. Appellants sought review and argued that respondent city improperly granted the tax abatement by resolution rather than by ordinance. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment because the steps taken by respondent city in passing the resolution substantially paralleled an exercise of power by ordinance and was in substance and effect an ordinance. The tax abatement was constitutional as that respondent developer was contractually bound to a profit limitation under its financing agreement and by the regulation incorporated into the agreement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mobile home park owners sought and obtained a rent increase from defendant township committee. Tenants appealed to defendant, which considered the case during private executive session. Plaintiffs had neither the notice nor the opportunity to be heard at the session. Defendant later reduced the rent increase. Plaintiffs filed an action alleging that defendant had denied them due process violating 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and that they were entitled to attorney fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. The trial court found that plaintiffs' due process rights were violated, but denied attorney fees, finding that defendant acted in good faith and that the burden of the fees would be placed upon innocent taxpayers. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause to the trial court. The reasons for denying the attorney fees advanced by the trial court were improper. Attorney fees should have been awarded as a matter of course. The good faith of defendant could not justify the denial of attorney's fees. The financial condition of the parties could not constitute special circumstances to defeat plaintiffs' entitlement to a fee award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant townships each adopted development fee ordinances in response to a judicial decision requiring municipalities to adopt land use regulations that created a realistic opportunity for the construction of low and moderate income housing. In four separate actions, appellee developers challenged the ordinances. The trial courts declared the ordinances facially invalid. On review, appellants, townships and the Public Advocate, contended that the development fee ordinances were sustainable because they were the &quot;functional equivalent&quot; to the Mount Laurel mandatory set-aside, and thus a valid land use regulation. The court affirmed in part, holding that three of the ordinances were unlawful taxes, which were imposed without legislative sanction and the development fees were not &quot;functionally equivalent&quot; to the mandatory set-aside technique. The court reversed respecting the validity of the fourth ordinance because it was not facially invalid due to the voluntary nature of the ordinance and a full factual inquiry was necessary to determine whether the voluntary development fee was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first-degree sexual assault, second-degree sexual assault, and endangering the welfare of a child. The victim, who was 10 years old at the time of trial, testified through closed circuit television. Defendant challenged the conviction and the court remanded the case to the trial court with directions to conduct a supplementary N.J. R. Evid. 8 hearing to determine the possible distress the victim would have suffered if she had been forced to confront defendant at the time of trial. The court held that if expert testimony could be developed that, together with other evidence, resulted in clear and convincing proof that the victim was permitted to testify at trial pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:84A-32.4, an order confirming the judgment was required. If not, a new trial had to be ordered. The court held that although &sect; 2A:84A-32.4 permitted a witness in a prosecution for certain crimes to be done through closed circuit television, a hearing had to be conducted first, and that where a defendant requested an expert evaluation of the witness in advance of the hearing, it had to be granted in the absence of specific reasons to justify denial of the request.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant car dealership sought review of the judgment from the Superior Court of New Jersey, Bergen County, which affirmed an adverse ruling to appellant's request for a variance from an ordinance that prohibited the loading and unloading of vehicles on the public street. Appellants had asserted that the ordinance was an invalid exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant car dealership challenged an ordinance prohibiting the loading and unloading of vehicles on public streets during deliveries to a car dealer, after its request for a variance claiming the ordinance was an invalid exercise of police power was denied by respondent zoning board. The trial court affirmed the board's decision, and the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court concluded that the challenge to the ordinance was not a matter to be considered by respondent zoning board under the sections of the Municipal Land Use Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55D-1 to -112, relating to land use variances, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55D-70(c), (d). The court determined that respondent borough passed the ordinance pursuant to its police power, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:48-1, not its zoning power, and that appellant could not challenge that ordinance's legality, as written or enforced, by a variance application under &sect; 40:55D-70, but should have challenged the ordinance's legality by an action in lieu of prerogative or in defense of respondent borough's prosecution for violating the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that respondent zoning board did not have jurisdiction to entertain appellant car dealership's application for relief from the ordinance, because it was passed under respondent borough's police power. The court stated that it expressed no view on appellant's contention that the ordinance was invalid, and added that appellant could pursue that argument in an appropriate forum.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged dismissal of its complaint for failure to state a cause of action against respondent car owner, and respondent filed a cross-appeal of the denial by the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Essex County, of his motion to dismiss for failure to serve the summons and complaint as required by N.J. Ct. R. 4:4-1. Appellant claimed that the complaint stated a cause of action for forfeiture of respondent's car.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent car owner was charged with the crime of causing death by auto. The state filed a complaint against respondent for forfeiture of the car under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:64-1 et seq. Respondent filed a cross-motion to dismiss the complaint because the state did not comply with N.J. Ct. R. 4:4-1. The trial court dismissed the complaint because it failed to state a cause of action as required by N.J. Ct. R. 4:6-2(e). The state challenged the decision, and respondent filed a cross-appeal. The court affirmed the dismissal. The court held that the car was driven recklessly, as defined in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:2-2b(3), and caused a death, as required by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-5. Therefore, a forfeiture was proper as alleged in the complaint, and the complaint was improperly dismissed. However, the state's failure to issue the summons within 10 days of the filing of the complaint, as required by N.J. Ct. R. 4:4-1, had the clear capacity to prejudice respondent. Accordingly, the court concluded that the trial court erred in exercising its discretion by denying respondent's motion to dismiss the complaint, pursuant to N.J. Ct. R. 4:37-2(a).</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the complaint and held that the certificates were inchoate liens placed against defendant shareholders' property that could not be executed until final agency adjudication of plaintiffs' responsibility. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the treatment of the filed certificates as interim liens satisfied U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother and defendant father were divorced and granted joint custody of their child with the primary residential custody remaining with plaintiff. Plaintiff appealed the judgment insofar as it prevented her from moving with the child to Florida. The trial court found that, while the move might have been beneficial to plaintiff, it would have proven detrimental to the child's relationship with defendant. The court reversed the trial court. The court held that defendant clearly had a significant connection with the state; therefore the jurisdictional provisions of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:34-31 were complied with. The court held that the trial court should have considered whether it would have been possible to honor defendant's visitation schedule while recognizing plaintiff's right to move. The court noted that defendant's reduction in child support could have helped finance transportation. The court also held that the trial court should have weighed the burden which defendant would have suffered if he was forced to relocate in order to remain close to the child against the burden plaintiff would have had to bear if she was forced to remain in New Jersey.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the decision of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Morris County, which dismissed charges against two defendants under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-7, which prohibited distributing or possessing drugs within 1,000 feet of a school.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed counts for distributing or possessing drugs within a defined school zone in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-7 against a defendant who was arrested for smuggling drugs into a jail that was located within 1,000 feet of a school and against a defendant who was pulled over by police in front of a school. The trial court held that &sect; 2C:35-7's 1,000-foot criteria was unconstitutional, that it was not intended to apply to offenses committed in a jail, and that it was not intended to apply to situations involving moving violations that happened to occur near a school. On consolidated appeal, the court reinstated the charges and remanded. The court held that &sect; 2C:35-7 was constitutional and that the legislature intended it to set forth a bright line test based strictly on distance from a school. The court found that inquiry into the circumstances of a drug offense was irrelevant under &sect; 2C:35-7's strict liability approach. The court found that the trial court's decision finding &sect; 2C:35-7's proscription against distribution or possession of drugs within 1,000 feet of a school bus was inappropriate because that section of the statute was not before the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and reinstated the charges of possessing drugs within 1,000 feet of a school because the statute was constitutional and its bright line test precluded inquiry into the circumstances of the drug possession. The court held that the trial court erred in finding the statute prohibiting possession of drugs within 1,000 feet of a school bus unconstitutional because that offense was not before the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Somerset County, which sentenced them to concurrent prison terms on each of several counts in indictments charging violations of controlled dangerous substance laws arguing that they had a right to require sentencing under the Comprehensive Drug Reform Act of 1986, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were arrested and indicted on charges of conspiracy, possession, and distribution of cocaine following an undercover investigation. They entered guilty pleas and were sentenced under the Controlled Dangerous Substance Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24:21-1et seq. The offenses were committed four months prior to the effective date of the Comprehensive Drug Reform Act of 1986 (CDRA), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-1 et seq., and the sentences were imposed four months after its effective date. Defendants appealed their sentences on the grounds that they had a right to election of sentencing under the CDRA. The court affirmed the sentences. The court held that defendants could request sentencing under the CDRA for offenses committed prior to its effective date but were not entitled to have their requests granted. The court held that the sentences were sustainable under either statute. Also, the court found that the trial court properly weighed the aggravating factors against the mitigating factor of their lack of prior criminal histories and any presumption of non-incarceration was rebutted. The sentences were not excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of a controlled dangerous substance within 1000 feet of a school. Appellant was adjudicated delinquent, was sentenced to a two-year custodial sentence that was stayed, and was placed on probation conditioned upon drug rehabilitation program. Appellant was required to pay the mandatory Drug Enforcement and Demand Reduction fine of $ 1000 pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-15(a)(3). Appellant sought review contending that the mandatory fine unconstitutionally discriminated against juveniles who were adjudicated delinquent. Further, he claimed that the penalty provisions were fundamentally unfair and violated constitutional principles of due process by placing an unjustifiably heavy burden on a juvenile's liberty and property interests. The State argued that the mandatory penalties required by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-15 were rationally related to the State's legitimate interest in deterring the possession, use and distribution of controlled dangerous substances by juveniles as well as adults. The court agreed with the State's contention and affirmed the imposed of a sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from convictions of two counts of sexual assault, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:14-2b, and two counts of endangering the welfare of a child, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:24-4. The offenses grew out of defendant's assault of two boys, ages four and five, behind the apartments where the boys lived. Defendant contended, among other things, that the trial judge erroneously denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal. The two problems that were raised were that one child could tell about the crime, but not about the perpetrator, while the other identified defendant as the perpetrator, but could not testify about the crime. Defendant claimed that each witness was allowed to impermissibly bolster the missing part of the other witness' case. The court affirmed, holding that this was a classic case of circumstantial evidence and the jury had the right to draw reasonable inference therefrom.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child, but modified the sentence to show concurrent indeterminate terms not to exceed five years for two counts of sexual assault.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute controlled substances and was sentenced to 25 years.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute controlled substances and was sentenced to 25 years. On appeal, his sentence was affirmed. Defendant then petitioned for post-conviction relief, arguing that at the time of his guilty plea, the prosecutor misrepresented to him that he was facing 25 years without parole, violating his rights under U.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV. The trial court denied the petition, and defendant appealed. The court affirmed, holding that because defendant had not raised these issues in his appeal and they did not present exceptional circumstances of fundamental injustice, the issues should not be considered. The court held that the alleged error was without merit, because defendant could have been sentenced to life imprisonment, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24:21-19b(2), with a parole disqualifier of up to half that time. N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:43-6b. Although the statute did not state how long half of a life sentence was, it was not unconstitutionally vague, because when read with N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:4-123.51b, it was clear that defendant could have received a 25-year parole disqualifier.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of defendant's petition, holding that the issues raised were not raised in defendant's direct appeal and did not present exceptional circumstances of fundamental injustice. The court held that representations at defendant's guilty plea hearing that he was facing 25 years without parole were not inaccurate, and so his contention based on misrepresentation was without merit.</SPAN></P>

At the scene, defendant presented a Maryland driver's license to the officer. Defendant acknowledged to the officer that he was the driver of the vehicle. Upon noticing an odor of alcohol, swaying, and bloodshot eyes, defendant was charged with driving while impaired. Defendant had prior charges of driving while impaired in New Jersey, and his New Jersey license had been suspended for the previous charges. The municipal judge found defendant guilty of driving while impaired and operating a vehicle with a suspended license without admission of the breathalyzer test.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent American Trial Lawyer's Association filed an action attacking the Products Liability Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:58C-1 et seq., under the New Jersey Declaratory Judgment Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:16-50 et seq., and the federal constitution. The Products Liability Act contained substantive provisions setting forth rules of liability and defenses, procedural requirements, and mandated bifurcated proceedings for the determination of compensatory and punitive damages. Appellant Attorney General sought interlocutory review of the trial court which ruled that respondent had the requisite standing to maintain the action and that its complaint presented a justiciable controversy. The court reversed and dismissed the complaint. The court found that the Products Liability Act did not regulate or purport to regulate respondent in any way, nor could the court determine how it effected respondent's members in a way that gave them standing to maintain their action.

The trial court enjoined appellants, county clerk and committee, from placing the question on the ballot. The trial court held that a deposit program must be enacted as part of the county's comprehensive solid waste management plan and that the bottle bill was preempted by the Clean Communities and Recycling Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1E-99.1 et seq. The court reversed the order, discharged the injunction, and directed appellant county clerk to include the proposed ordinance on the ballot. The court found no clear or facial invalidity in the proposed ordinance or conflict with state law or policy. Further, there was no clear intention by the state to preempt counties from entering the field and there was no indication of a requirement for uniformity of handling anti-litter regulations. The court concluded that the initiative was not necessarily invalidated by the fact that the county had not yet adopted a comprehensive recycling plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff ticket brokers brought suit against defendant, the state of New Jersey, challenging New Jersey's anti-ticket-scalping law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:8-26 et seq. The lower court granted summary judgment in favor of defendant and dismissed those portions of plaintiffs' complaints which attacked the constitutionality of the statute. On appeal, the court noted that legislative enactments regulating prices were subject to a narrow scope of review in accordance with the due process clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court held that due process was satisfied because the statute was reasonably related to a proper legislative purpose and promoted the public welfare without discrimination or arbitrariness. Plaintiff's argument that the statute violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, the commerce clause, was also held to be without merit in the absence of evidence that the commerce clause was implicated, and in light of the fact that the statute promoted a legitimate governmental interest. After ruling that plaintiffs' further constitutional claims lacked substance, and finding no remaining issues of fact, the court affirmed the order which granted summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect;&sect; 2C:11-3 and 2C:39-4a, based on contended error in refusing to permit the jury to consider his age in determining whether the homicide was committed in heat of passion resulting from reasonable provocation and in restricting evidence regarding the victim's assaultive acts against others. The court rejected appellant's urged errors and affirmed the conviction in respondent state's favor. The court explained the standard for provocation sufficient to reduce murder to manslaughter was based upon provocation calculated to produce passion in an average man of ordinary self control. The court further noted this did not mean that an actor's age could never be considered in determining the issue of reasonable provocation under an objective standard. Instead, the court concluded that in the present case, appellant's age had no particular relevance on the issue of whether the deceased's conduct would have prompted a homicidal rage in a reasonable person. The court also explained absent proof of appellant's knowledge of a deceased's reputation, evidence thereof was inadmissible.</SPAN></P>

In support of their request, appellants agreed to provide intelligent waivers and stated that the reasons for the request were to shorten the trial time for a complicated case, limit publicity, and because of the emotional issues. The state urged a trial and the trial court rejected appellants' request, stating that because it was a high profile case, it should appear to the public that a jury of appellants' peers had reached a verdict. Appellants challenged the trial court's order. The court reversed the trial court's order and stated that even though a request for waiver of a jury trial was not a constitutional or unconditional right, it should not be denied without good reason. The court then held that appellants supported their request with good reasons and that the trial judge's refusal due to the perception of public expectation was an improper basis for denial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff church appealed an order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Tax Court, Gloucester County (New Jersey), that upheld the levy of taxes on plaintiff's property for a particular tax year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff church purchased property after the assessment date for the 1984 tax year. Prior to plaintiff's purchase, the property had been used for a nonexempt purpose. Plaintiff was assessed taxes for the 1984 tax year. The assessment was affirmed by the trial court, and plaintiff appealed. The court held that pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 54:4-23, 4-35, the status of property as exempt or nonexempt was determined by its ownership and use on October 1 of the pre-tax year. Because the property plaintiff purchased was non-exempt as of October 1, 1983, taxes were assessable on the property for the 1984 tax year. The court found that the denial of exempt status for plaintiff did not violate U.S. Const. amend. I or N.J. Const. art. I, par. 3. Nothing required that religious property be exempt from taxation from the moment of its acquisition. Further, there was a compelling state interest in not cancelling the tax liability on land mid-way through a tax year because such a cancellation would unfairly burden other taxpayers. Plaintiff's tenet against the payment of taxes provided no basis for resisting the tax. The order upholding the tax assessment was thus affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order that upheld the levy of taxes on plaintiff church's property for a particular tax year was affirmed because, pursuant to statute, the property was non-exempt as of the tax assessment date. Further, neither constitutional nor statutory law precluded taxation of plaintiff's property and the state had a compelling interest in not changing the tax status of property mid-way through a particular tax year.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was arrested and charged with numerous motor vehicle and disorderly persons violations. The officer had entered the garage just as the automatic door started to close and had advised defendant that he was under arrest, but defendant proceeded to the bedroom and locked the door. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence against him.

The court found that the officer had probable cause only as to certain motor vehicle offenses, and those relatively minor offenses did not justify the kind of warrantless intrusion that occurred. The court concluded that the officer could not justify his warrantless intrusion based on the need to avoid the dissipation of blood alcohol, because blood alcohol was not evidential as to any offense with respect to which he had probable cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed an order from the Superior Court of Essex County (New Jersey), denying her motion for reconsideration and granting the summary judgment motions of defendants, chemical plant, engineer, and engineering firm. Plaintiff claimed she was entitled to recover under the Wrongful Death Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:31-1 et seq., as the purported &quot;wife&quot; of defendant plant's deceased employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant company operated a chemical plant. Defendant engineer prepared a plan to bring the plant into compliance with state environmental laws. A chemical distillation unit in the plant exploded and killed an employee. Plaintiff, who cohabited with the employee, brought a suit against the employer and the engineer and his firm, alleging wrongful death, negligence, and strict liability. The court dismissed the suits. On appeal, the court affirmed. Plaintiff's individual claim was barred under the Wrongful Death Act (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:31-4 et seq., because she was not the decedent's spouse. Since damages under the Act did not depend upon the a survivor's needs, it was immaterial that plaintiff's children might have to provide for her future medical care with funds from their award. No equal protection claim existed because illegitimacy did not bar the children's recovery. Because defendant engineer and his firm were retained simply to prepare generalized drawings of the processing system components in order to show how the chemicals were carried, stored and discharged, and their work did not involve safety processes, dismissal against these defendants was upheld.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of a wrongful death suit against defendants, employer, engineer, and engineering firm. Because plaintiff was not married to a deceased employee, she could not recover for wrongful death against the employer. Because defendant engineer and defendant engineering firm were not hired as safety engineers, they could not be held liable for an explosion at the employer's chemical plant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pharmacy store advertised that all prescriptions for a one-week period would be offered for a flat fee of $ 3. Petitioner was charged with violating N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 45:14-12(f). At a hearing before the State Board of Pharmacy, petitioner testified that he was the pharmacist in charge of the store and that the decision to run the advertisement was not his but a corporate level decision. The Board found petitioner guilty of grossly unprofessional conduct in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 45:14-12(f) and found him responsible under N.J. Admin. Code &sect; 13:39-8.14b14. Petitioner sought review claiming that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 45:14-12(f) was unconstitutional for failure to satisfy due process requirements. The Superior Court held that the statute did not fulfill the purpose of serving the public health, safety or welfare because it did not bear any relationship to the legislative objective sought to be obtained by the statute, the banning of practices which would lower standards of professional service by a pharmacist. The court determined that the statute was void for vagueness because there was no fixed or otherwise identifiable price from which the discount could be calculated.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, he alleged the statute was unconstitutional because it was overbroad and void for vagueness. The court affirmed his conviction and found that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it was sufficiently definite to give notice that no one could undermine enforcement of criminal justice by attempting to coerce or induce witnesses or informants not to cooperate with law enforcement. It also held that the statute was not overbroad because it furthered the important governmental interest of preventing intimidation of, and interference with, potential witnesses or informers in criminal matters, and held that it easily met the test of weighing the importance of the exercise of speech against the gravity and probability of harm therefrom. The court found that when the public interest in discovering the truth in official proceedings was balanced against a party's right to speak to a particular witness with the intent of tampering, that party's right was minuscule.</SPAN></P>

Prior to trial, defendant's counsel informed the trial court that there would be no alibi defense. After the state presented its case, defendant testified that he was somewhere else when the robbery occurred. The trial court instructed the jury to disregard defendant's alibi statement and the jury convicted defendant of robbery. The court affirmed the conviction. The court applied a three-factor balancing test on the trial court's preclusion of defendant's alibi defense. The court held that the trial court's jury instruction was proper because defendant's alibi statement was highly prejudicial to the state, which was not given notice of the alibi defense and who had completed its case in chief before the statement was made, and because it was likely that the withholding of the alibi defense was deliberate and a fragrant violation of N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff religious group had title to a piece of land in defendant municipality and wanted to build a place of worship and other buildings.

The trial court concluded that defendants had completely excluded plaintiffs and violated their rights to freedom of religion. On appeal, the court remanded the case to the trial court for findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court stated that the record had no relevant facts about the religious nature and significance of plaintiff's planned activities, whether there was other property available in the municipality that would have served plaintiff's needs, and the kind and extent of disruption to defendant municipality's zoning plan plaintiff's church would have created.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant purchased a house that was supplied with natural gas without the gas company's knowledge. The gas company had installed gas service for defendant's predecessor in interest, but the company mistakenly recorded the address of the house and never corrected the error. Defendant knew that normally one paid for gas, and that he was not doing so, but continued to receive the gas. After a jury trial, defendant was found guilty of unlawfully and purposefully obtaining natural gas without compensation, in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:20-8(a). On appeal, the court reversed the judgment because defendant's conduct was not criminalized by the statute. The court held that a person who knowingly accepted services without payment which the person knew were available only for compensation did not violate &sect; 2C:20-8(a) unless there was a verbal or physical act of deception, fraud or threat, or false token, slug, mechanical or electronic device, or like means employed to avoid payment for the service. Because defendant did not engage in any affirmative act, the court remanded the case with instructions to enter judgment dismissing the indictment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the very fact that the law school provided public higher education made it a full-fledged state agency that performed a governmental function. The fact that the law school had no personal or pecuniary interest in the outcome of plaintiff's litigation was irrelevant, as the legislature had not intended to preclude only those types of conflicts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, police and fire department personnel, appealed from a final determination by the Division of Pensions, Department of Treasury (New Jersey), which advised plaintiffs that they were required to retire from their positions because they were over the age of 65. Plaintiffs' actions for injunctive relief against the enforcement of their mandatory retirement were transferred to the appellate court by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the appeals by plaintiffs, the police and fire personnel, from their notifications of mandatory retirement to determine the duties of each of the individual plaintiffs. The court held that if an individual plaintiff was not primarily and directly involved in the duties outlined in 29 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 630(j) and (k) that plaintiff was not subject to mandatory early retirement. The 1986 federal amendments to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act exempted police and fire personnel from mandatory retirement restrictions. The court agreed that the 1986 amendments served to reinstate New Jersey's public employee pension laws, which included mandatory retirement ages for police and fire personnel, as they existed in 1983. The court held, however, that those mandatory retirement ages applied only to police and fire personnel whose duties came within the definitions found in &sect;&sect; 630(j) and (k). Language in &sect;&sect; 630(j) and (k) regarding personnel transferred to supervisory positions did not apply to bona fide promotions to those positions. Thus, where bona fide promotions placed a plaintiff outside the parameters of &sect;&sect; 630(j) and (k), mandatory retirement was not applicable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the appeals of plaintiffs, the police and fire department personnel, from their notifications of mandatory retirement. The court found that mandatory retirement did not apply to personnel who had bona fide promotions to supervisory or administrative positions and who were not directly involved in the day to day duties of police and fire personnel as defined by federal regulations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a corporation and three minorities, sued defendant cities to invalidate exclusionary zoning and to make possible the construction of housing that was affordable by low and moderate income people. Due to a complex procedural history involving appeals and remands, plaintiffs prevailed on their state constitutional nonfee claims, but were improperly precluded from presenting evidence calculated to establish racial and ethic discrimination in violation of their asserted federal claims before the trial court. The court reversed the order denying plaintiffs' application for attorney fees and costs. Because of the unique procedural history, plaintiffs were entitled to establish on the record that they were entitled to counsel fees if their evidence established an unrebutted prima facie violation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3601 et seq. On remand, the trial court was directed to determine this issue using only the record, expert reports based on that record, and matters that could be judicially noticed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant dog owner was convicted of permitting his dogs to bark late at night and early in the morning in violation of Montclair Township, N.J., Ordinance Art. III, &sect; 166-11 (1947). On appeal, the first summons, and four of the five convictions from the second summons were reversed. The court held that the form of complaint required the officer to sign and swear to the complaint in the presence of a person authorized to make a probable cause determination. On the face of the complaint filed in connection with the first summons, the officer did not sign or swear to the complaint as required by N.J. R. Civ. P. 3:3-1(a) and N.J. R. Civ. P. 3:3-2. Because there was no determination of probable cause, the summons and complaint were fatally defective. In addition, the second summons and the complaint were sworn to by the deputy court clerk who also made a determination of probable cause. However, defendant was put on trial without knowing how many charges he was facing. He learned he was facing multiple charges only after he was shown a copy of complainant's trial notes. Because there has been a violation of a defendant's constitutional right to due process, prejudice was presumed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney, a public defender, challenged an order from the Superior Court of Union County (New Jersey), which found him in criminal contempt of court, imposed a fine, and ordered that he serve two days in county jail.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney, a public defender, who was found in criminal contempt, challenged his conviction and sentence. After being held in contempt, the trial court gave appellant an opportunity to be heard. The trial court then fined him and ordered that he serve two days in county jail. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in finding that his statements and conduct were disrespectful and contemptuous. Appellant also argued that the trial court violated his rights by failing to order an evidentiary hearing in which witnesses could be called to support his case. The appellate court affirmed the finding of criminal contempt because the contempt power could be invoked in the state courts for any conduct that tended to obstruct the course of justice. The appellate court held that appellant was not denied his right to be heard merely because the lower court announced that it found him in contempt before appellant had a chance to speak. The appellate court held that the crucial consideration was whether appellant was afforded an opportunity to address the court. The appellate court, however, reversed the jail term imposed because imprisonment was not an appropriate punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a de novo review of the conviction for criminal contempt, the court determined that appellant attorney's behavior was properly punished as contempt. The court held that an evidentiary hearing was not needed because the contumacious conduct occurred entirely in the lower court's presence. The court, however, vacated the jail term imposed because being fined and rebuked in open court was appropriate punishment.</SPAN></P>

When the police officer asked defendant for identification so that he could write out a summons, defendant could not produce any identification. Defendant was taken to the police station.

Defendant's bail was set at $ 100 to secure his attendance for the summons. Defendant could not make bail and was placed in a holding cell. Pursuant to an inventory search, cocaine was discovered on defendant's person. At the trial, defendant's motion to suppress the evidence was denied and defendant pled guilty to unlawful possession of cocaine. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of the motion to suppress. The court found that the officer acted reasonably in taking defendant down to the station for identification purposes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state challenged decision of the Superior Court of New Jersey, which dismissed of judgments against defendant trucking corporations finding that defendants violated state motor vehicle laws by operating trucks weighing more than their registrations permitted and more than permitted by law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant trucking companies were charged with operating vehicles in excess of its registration, N.J. Stat.

Defendant appealed from the judgments against them and the trial court dismissed the complaints. Plaintiff state appealed and the court reversed. The court held that defendants' argument that the registration laws were merely revenue-producing laws was meritless. The court found that the revenue-producing character of the laws was no reason not to apply the laws. The court also found that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:3-20 was constitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former licensed realtors sought review of the decision of respondent New Jersey Real Estate Commission, which denied their respective applications for relicensure as real estate salespersons after they allowed their licenses to expire, pursuant to the amended N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former licensed realtors allowed their real estate licenses to expire at a time when the law allowed a five-year period for renewing the licenses without having to undergo re-education or re-examination. They sought to renew their licenses five years and three years later, respectively; however, in the interim, the legislature had amended N.J. Stat.

Appellants' applications were denied by respondent New Jersey Real Estate Commission, and they were advised that they had to satisfy the statutory educational and examination requirements. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that ample notice of the amendment to &sect; 45:15-9 was mandated and provided, even if appellants never received it. The federal and state constitutions did not require actual and individual notice. Neither, the court concluded, were appellants' rights violated, because at the time the law was changed they had no vested right that was adversely affected.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant licensee challenged the decision of respondent New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control, which suspended appellant's liquor license for 17 days for the sale or delivery of beer to a person under the legal age to purchase and consume alcoholic beverages. Appellant disagreed with respondent's interpretation of N.J. Admin. Code &sect; 13:2-23.1(a), as well as its findings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state police inspector observed appellant licensee's employee make a sale of alcoholic beverages to a minor and an of-age individual. In the ensuing disciplinary proceeding, respondent New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control found three violations of N.J. Admin. Code &sect; 13:2-23.1(a). Respondent suspended appellant's plenary retail distribution license for 17 days. Appellant sought review of the 15-day suspension imposed for the sale or delivery of beer to a person under the legal age to purchase and consume alcoholic beverages. Respondent rejected the initial decision of an administrative law judge, who had dismissed the charge. Appellant challenged respondent's interpretation of the regulation and its findings. The court affirmed the suspension. Although there was conflicting evidence of who actually purchased the alcohol, the state's interest in protecting young people against the dangers resulting from consuming alcoholic beverages was advanced by prohibiting a retail distribution licensee from selling or delivering packaged alcoholic beverages to a person under age.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of respondent New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control against appellant licensee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State appealed from the judgment of Superior Court of New Jersey, Monmouth County, which denied forfeiture of a boat owned by a bona fide purchaser for value in the state's suit against respondents, the boat, its current owner, and certain others under the forfeiture statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:64-1a(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An individual was convicted of theft by deception as the result of an insurance fraud scheme in which he falsely reported to the insurer that his boat was lost at sea. In the meantime, the boat had been sold to a series of bona fide purchasers who were unaware of the fraud. The state filed suit against respondents, the boat, its current owner, and certain others under the forfeiture statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:64-1a(2). The trial court denied forfeiture of the boat. The court affirmed. The New Jersey Supreme Court had previously held that the forfeiture statute was required to be read to exempt innocent owners and to apply only to owners who used their property for criminal purposes and to those who knowingly allowed others to use their property for such purposes. The statute could also apply to innocent owners who did not use due care to prevent the unlawful use of their property by third parties. None of these circumstances applied here. The state in this case stipulated that the current owner played no part in, nor had any knowledge of, the theft by deception from the insurer regarding the boat.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Court affirmed the denial of forfeiture because boat's owner had no knowledge of previous owner's insurance fraud. Forfeiture statute was required to be read to exclude innocent owners who did not consent to or know of illegal use of their property and who used due care to prevent that use.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of Superior Court of New Jersey, Warren County, which convicted him of possession of controlled dangerous substance with intent to distribute and sentenced him to 10 years in prison, contending the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's finding of a knowing and intentional possession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for possession of a controlled dangerous substance with intent to distribute. The evidence at trial showed that he was a front seat passenger in a car driven by a co-defendant, which was stopped for speeding. Defendant's stepmother, another co-defendant, was a passenger in the rear seat. The occupants were ordered out of the car. Defendant's stepmother suggested that she might be able to find some identification in a bag that was next to her in the car. The trooper saw her take two large business envelopes out of the bag and drop them through a storm grate. The envelopes were recovered and found to contain heroin. The court reversed defendant's conviction. Criminal possession signified intentional control and dominion. It could not be inferred from defendant's mere presence at the location where the contraband was found. Here, the heroin was contained in two envelopes which, in turn, were secreted in a bag resting next to defendant's stepmother. To all appearances, it was her bag. Defendant's presence in the car under these circumstances did not suffice to authorize an inference that he was sharing in the intentional control and dominion over the contraband.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated action, plaintiffs, motor carrier trade organization and motor carriers, appealed decisions of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Mercer County in favor of defendants, state and officials, which upheld the constitutionality of the Counterpart Fee Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:3-6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two separate cases, plaintiffs, motor carrier trade organization and motor carriers, filed suit against defendants, state and officials, arguing that the Counterpart Fee Act (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39.3-6, which imposed a tax on trucks operating in New Jersey that are registered in one of 18 states that imposed taxes for highway use on trucks registered in New Jersey, was unconstitutional. The trial court upheld the Act, granting summary judgment for defendants. Plaintiffs appealed. The court held that the purpose of the Act was retaliatory in nature because it was designed to induce other states not to impose highway use taxes on New Jersey registered vehicles. Because retaliation was not a legitimate local public interest and the tax discriminated against interstate vehicles, the Act violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The court reversed the decisions and awarded refunds to plaintiffs for fees paid after the filing of their complaints. Plaintiffs were not entitled to counsel fees because 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 did not apply to this type of action. The ruling denying class certification in one of the cases was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decisions and remanded the case for further proceedings because the Counterpart Fee Act violated the Commerce Clause as retaliation against other states was not a legitimate local public interest and the tax discriminated against interstate vehicles. Plaintiffs were awarded refunds of fees paid after their complaints were filed. The court affirmed the order denying class certification in one of these consolidated actions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff fraternal order of police appealed the order of the Superior Court, Essex County (New Jersey), which sustained defendant city's directive mandating that all members of the police narcotics bureau be subjected to urine testing for drug abuse both upon transfer into the bureau and at least twice a year afterwards, on the grounds that the directive required an unconstitutional search and seizure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff fraternal order of police filed an action to invalidate a directive issued by defendant city police director mandating that all members of the narcotic bureau be subjected to urine testing for drug abuse both upon transfer into the bureau and at least twice a year afterwards. The trial court sustained the directive, and plaintiffs appealed. The court found that drug testing without probable cause or reasonable individualized suspicion was unreasonable and constitutionally invalid. The court found that such testing constituted a significant interference with personal privacy and autonomy, and it involved an intrusion upon a most private kind of conduct. Both in concept and in practice, the intrusion was profoundly demeaning. Drug testing also had serious pragmatic implications including loss of employment and possible criminal prosecution. The protectable privacy interests of plaintiffs were thus very substantial. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded for the entry of judgment invalidating defendant's directive and for the trial court to address plaintiff's claim for damages under 42 U.S.C.A. &sect; 1983 arising from the urine tests already taken.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded for entry of a judgment in favor of plaintiff fraternal order of police. Defendant city's drug testing of police in the absence of probable cause or a reasonable individualized suspicion was unreasonable and unconstitutional. The court also remanded to the trial court for consideration of plaintiff's claim for damages arising from urine tests already taken.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff resident challenged the order from the Superior Court, Monmouth County (New Jersey), which granted summary judgment dismissing plaintiff's complaint to enjoin defendant county clerk from placing two referendum questions on the election ballot pursuant to defendant tavern association's petition. Plaintiff maintained that placing the referendum questions on the ballot violated N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1-47.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant tavern owners association petitioned the Board of Commissioners to place on the 1986 ballot two questions to expand the hours of sale of alcoholic beverages. Plaintiff resident claimed that placing the questions on the ballot violated N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1-47.1, which stated that after there had been a referendum, no further referendum on the same question could be held for another five years. Plaintiff sought to enjoin defendant county clerk from placing the questions on the ballot. The trial court entered summary judgment against plaintiff and held that there was no violation of &sect; 33:1-47.1. Plaintiff appealed. While his appeal was pending, both questions were approved at the 1986 election. Plaintiff sought to enjoin defendant county clerk from certifying the election results and to accelerate the appeal. The court denied injunctive relief but granted the acceleration. On appeal, the court held that the 1985 ballot questions, which limited the hours of sale for alcoholic beverages, were the same substantive questions as those placed on the 1986 ballot. As &sect; 33:1-47.1 was mandatory, the violation of the statute invalidated the election.</SPAN></P>

Placing the referendum questions submitted by defendant Association on the 1986 election ballot violated the five-year rule and, as the five-year rule was mandatory, not directory, the violation invalidated the election.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge entered judgment in favor of defendant and concluded that the amendment clearly intended to refer to the immediate preceding calendar year.

The court held that the language of the amendment could not have been any clearer.

It disagreed with the trial court, holding that plaintiff had the power to condemn the properties and that the grant of power, under the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency Law of 1983, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 55:14K-1 et seq., was accompanied by standards sufficiently clear and definite to sustain its constitutionality. However, the court affirmed the dismissals because it found that plaintiff had failed to disclose its appraisals of defendant owners' properties during pre-litigation negotiations. The court held that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20:3-6 required such disclosure and that plaintiff's willful violation of &sect; 20:3-6 warranted the remedy of dismissal.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the grant of the permits because there was no merit in appellants' arguments. The court held that respondent's application, which included the lowest available emission rate, was proper because the county was a nonattainment area.

In affirming the conviction, the court held that the prohibition against driving with a suspended licensed continued past the suspension period. According to the court, a reasonable interpretation of section 39:3-40 meant that the suspension continued until actual restoration of the license by the director. The court stated that implicit in the director of motor vehicle's pervasive power over the licensing and suspending of driving privileges was a right to keep a license in suspension until it was restored after appropriate application for restoration by the licensee. Thus, the court concluded that defendant was in violation of the statute because he never sought restoration of his license.</SPAN></P>

The court held defendants' obligation was met when they transported the suspects to the hospital for treatment. The court stated that there was no obligation on the part of defendants to pay for medical care and treatment where police injured the patient during apprehension.

No live witnesses appeared at the hearings before the ALJ, except appellants, who invoked their U.S. Const. amend. V. privilege against self-incrimination. The court affirmed because the findings grounded in hearsay evidence did not have to be supported by a residuum of competent evidence. The statute was not void for vagueness because a person of ordinary intelligence would understand that a person who possessed appellants' characteristics would be deemed &quot;inimical&quot; to the state's interests within the meaning of N.J.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff apartment owner challenged the constitutionality of a local rent leveling ordinance that capped rental increases at 3 1/2 percent. Although the trial court found for plaintiff, the appellate division reversed and ordered plaintiff to reimburse tenants by the difference between that which was collected and the 3 1/2 percent cap. Defendant tenants complained to the rent leveling board, alleging that plaintiff had violated the local ordinance capping rental increases by raising defendants' rent by 4.8 percent. Plaintiff argued that, because the maximum cap rate had since been modified to 6 1/2 percent, it was entitled to apply this rate to the new lease with defendants. The board concluded that plaintiffs were bound by the 3 1/2 percent cap rate in place when it resigned the lease with defendants. On appeal to the superior court, the trial court affirmed the board's determination. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that plaintiff was subject to the 3 1/2 percent cap because it was in effect at the time that the new lease was signed. The court ruled that the local ordinance was not preempted by the Anti-Eviction Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2A:18-61.1 and 2A:18-61.2.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant condominium owners' association increased the parking fee for tenants of non-resident owners but did not change the fee charged to resident owners. Plaintiff, a nonresident owner, attacked the rule as being unreasonable and unconstitutionally discriminatory. The trial court held that the fee structure was not unconstitutional because there was no state action and that the rule did not burden nonresident owners any more than resident owners because the tenant dealt directly with defendant and not the owner. On appeal the court held that, to determine whether defendant breached its fiduciary duty, it had to be determined whether its action was authorized by its own by-laws, and, if so, whether the action was fraudulent, self-dealing, or unconscionable. The court found that the action was authorized and that it was not fraudulent, self-dealing, or unconscionable because it benefitted all owners.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, 29-year-old son of deceased, sought review of denial of his claim to workers' compensation benefits for his father's compensable accident, contending that the Division of Workers' Compensation erred in finding that while he was dependent upon deceased, within the meaning of N.J.

In support of its ruling, the court held that dependency for workers' compensation purposes was determined not by actual dependency but by qualification under the strict terms of the statute. The court further held that as the age parameters defining dependency in the statute were at least rationally based, the court had no discretion to enlarge the class of eligible dependents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant residents brought an action that challenged the grant of a use variance by respondent board of adjustment to respondent business partnership for a two-story office building in a residential zone. The trial court upheld the variance on the basis that a special reason existed for a use variance under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55D-70(d), that the subject property was not realistically developable for residential use, and that an office would relate well to the area's development. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that there had not been a sufficient showing of a special reason for a use variance. The court stated that a use other than one inherently promoting the general welfare could provide a special reason for a variance under &sect; 40:55D-70(d) if it promoted the public health, safety, or welfare and was particularly suited to the location. The court found, however, that the proposed use would be a commercial enterprise for profit, not per se contributing to the public health or safety or otherwise serving a public need. The fact that the proposed office would fit well into the area was not a special reason for a variance under &sect; 40:55D-70(d).</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment, concluding the administrative regulation prescribing rules for the use of eminent domain power, N.J. Admin. Code &sect; 48:5A-2, was valid. The court determined the regulation was incidental to the broad overall powers delegated to the administrative agency charged with administering the Cable Television Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:5A-49. The court explained there was a strong presumption in favor of administrative rule making authority and in finding rules thereby adopted valid. The court found the provision establishing just compensation was not unreasonable by reason of a presumption of what qualified as &quot;just.&quot; The court further found restriction to the before and after method was also appropriate in view of the fact installation did not result in any &quot;taking&quot; in fee based on physical occupation.</SPAN></P>

The reviewing court disagreed, stating that a murder conviction based on knowing conduct could result from conduct that was practically certain to cause serious bodily injury when death was a result of the injury caused. Therefore, the state had to show only that defendant wanted to cause serious bodily injury which ended up resulting in death. Defendant also argued that, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3b, there was no minimum term of 30 years imprisonment without parole eligibility. However, the court looked to the legislative history and found that the legislature's intent was to have a mandatory minimum sentence of 30 years upon conviction for murder.

He sought review, claiming that it was error for the trial court to deny his request for a jury instruction on diminished capacity pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:4-2. The court affirmed the convictions for terroristic threats and kidnapping but reversed the remaining convictions, finding that it was reversible error to deny appellant's requested jury instruction. The court concluded that the instruction could have affected the jury's determination on appellant's ability to act purposely or knowingly, which were elements of the offenses for the reversed convictions. The court determined that the testimony of witnesses from both sides indicated that a question existed on appellant's ability to form the requisite state of mind that was an element of the offenses. The court concluded that consideration of the diminished capacity defense might well have led the jury to conclude that defendant acted only recklessly or without any culpable state of mind at all.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff filed an action alleging that he was beaten while incarcerated in a county facility. After his release from the county facility, plaintiff was later incarcerated in a state institution. The appellate court found that, contrary to plaintiff's assertion that the statute of limitations was tolled for the pendency of plaintiff's incarceration, N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of conspiracy to rob upon jury verdict. On appeal, he asserted several points of alleged error, including claims that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the affirmative defense of renunciation of purpose, and that the prosecution improperly used its peremptory challenges. Appellant allegedly told a police officer of a planned robbery approximately a month before the robbery took place. However, appellant never revealed that he had agreed to participate in the robbery. The appellate court found that the defense of renunciation required that appellant reveal his participation in the conspiracy. The court also found that the prosecution did not improperly strike jurors of a certain race because, although the appellate court found no adequate reason for the strike of two jurors, it would rely on the fair and impartial decision making of the trial court. Finally, the appellate court rejected appellant's contention that the jury's verdict was in error because the jury rendered an inconsistent verdict by failing to convict appellant for actual robbery, but convicting him for conspiracy to rob. As such, the lower court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer sought review of an order of the Tax Court (New Jersey), which dismissed appellant's complaint for failure to comply with N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer purchased an apartment complex in respondent borough and after failing to provide the principal tax assessor the requested income and expense data for the complex, appellant filed a petition with the board of taxation requesting the reduction of its assessment. The lower court dismissed appellant's action finding that appellant failed to satisfy the &quot;good cause&quot; provision of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-34. The court reversed the lower court's dismissal and remanded the cause for the consideration of the claim of unreasonableness. The court determined that it could not say whether appellant was discriminated against and whether there was an improper &quot;spot assessment&quot; because the assessor reassessed at approximately 87 percent of its sale price. The court found that appellant's due process rights were not violated by a strict enforcement of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-34.

The court held that the words in the statute, when given their ordinary and popular meaning, have a sufficient popular connotation to apprise men of common intelligence, with a reasonable degree of certainty, as to the possibility of the imposition of a parole ineligibility term.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff accused appealed a judgment non obstante verdicto from the Superior Court, Law Division, Essex County (New Jersey), that dismissed plaintiff's action brought under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 against defendant detective for filing a criminal complaint without probable cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based upon a prosecutor's advice after reviewing a caseworker's report and plaintiff accused's exculpatory statement, defendant detective filed a criminal complaint against plaintiff for aggravated assault. Because a subsequent medical report was consistent with plaintiff's exculpatory statement, defendant administratively dismissed the criminal complaint. Plaintiff filed suit under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, claiming that defendant violated his civil rights by initiating the complaint without probable cause. The court reversed the judgment non obstante verdicto (n.o.v.) in favor of defendant. The court held that the determination whether probable cause existed was for the jury to determine, because questions existed regarding the reasonableness of defendant's investigation which formed the basis of her belief that plaintiff committed a crime. Because there were also disputed facts with respect to the objective reasonableness of defendant's knowledge at the time of instituting the criminal complaint, with respect to a qualified immunity defense of reliance on counsel advice, this issue too was for a jury to determine. Thus entry of judgment n.o.v. was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed, holding that the ordinance was unenforceable; N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was assessed insurance surcharge penalties based upon convictions for speeding,, driving while intoxicated, and failing to take a breathalyzer test. An administrative law judge determined petitioner was subject to the Merit Rating Plan surcharge. Respondent Acting Director of the Division of Motor Vehicles affirmed. Petitioner contended the imposition of the surcharge pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:29A-33, et seq. had been unconstitutionally applied to him on an ex post facto basis and that the surcharges were penal in nature. The appellate court affirmed and determined to be without merit petitioner's claim that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:29A-33, et seq. as applied to him violated the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws. The prohibition applied only when the legislation was retrospective in operation and the Merit Rating Plan surcharge was approved prior to petitioner's arrest. The court ruled petitioner's claim that the statute was punitive in nature also failed because the prohibition against ex post facto law only applied to punitive legislation and did not apply to retrospective legislation involving a statutory system of civil penalties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners challenged Long Beach Township, N.J., Ordinance No. 81-1C, which rezoned plaintiffs' property and restricted its use.

The appeals court reversed and held that the procedural defects had been corrected. The supreme court held that the new ordinance was identical to the old and remanded. On review, the court reversed and upheld the ordinance. The court held that by designating the area as public open space, defendant township intended to provide recreational facilities and access to the bay, and to preserve the aesthetic value of a bay view from the boulevard, and that, therefore, the challenged ordinance advanced one of the several purposes enumerated in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55 D-2.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant nursing home sought review of a regulation adopted by the Department of Human Services, Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services (New Jersey) and the underlying bulletin, providing a revised policy for the calculation of reimbursable final per diem rates chargeable by long-term care facilities under the Medicaid program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its challenge to a regulation adopted by the Department of Human Services, Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services, appellant nursing home argued that the regulation was ultra vires, violated federal and state Medicaid reimbursement schemes and, by its retroactive application, offended due process. The regulation in question provided a revised policy for the calculation of reimbursable final per diem rates chargeable by long-term care facilities under the Medicaid program. The court held that the regulation provided for the setting of the per diem rate on the basis of cost reports submitted by the facility. Further, the appeal process permitted the correction of inaccurate cost reporting during a 15-month period following the setting of a rate. Therefore the regulation and its reflected policy did not offend the statutory scheme. The court was satisfied that a balancing of the public interest served by the regulation against the settled expectations of long term care facilities affected by its retroactive application favored the regulation and compelled the conclusion that its implementation did not infringe upon due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the appeal on the basis that the regulation constituted a valid exercise of the commissioner's statutory discretion to administer the Medicaid program, was in harmony with the legislative history of the federal Medicaid statute, served the public interest, and represented a rational choice of the state agency charged with administering a program of limited resources.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on a history of crime in the township, defendant township enacted an ordinance that prohibited gas stations and convenience stores from opening between the hours of 12 a.m. and 6 a.m., but permitting other retail establishments to remain open during those hours. Plaintiffs, an individual retail gasoline dealer and a convenience food stores operator, challenged the ordinance's validity. The court held that the ordinance was unenforceable as to plaintiff food store operator, because defendant failed to present evidence of a compelling public need in order to justify such a drastic measure. The court raised defendant's burden as to plaintiff food store because its impact was so prohibitory on that plaintiff.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant repair shop challenged a grant of summary judgment on cross-motions in favor of plaintiff creditor involving the issue of priority between a perfected security interest and a garage-keeper's lien on the repairs of a tractor. Defendants claimed that the garage-keeper's lien act, N. J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A: 44-20-31, had previously been held unconstitutional in all respects, that it was entitled to an artisan's lien, and that plaintiff had been unjustly enriched at defendants' expense. The court held that the lien order of priorities embodied in &sect; 2A: 44-21 was preserved and found no merit to defendant's contention that the act had been held unconstitutional in its entirety. Defendant contended that by making repairs to the tractor, it enhanced the vehicle's value and claimed an artisan's possessory lien. Because defendant conceded that the personal property was a motor vehicle, it could not claim an artisan's lien. Defendants could have anticipated that the vehicle was subject to a financing statement and taken steps to protect its position. Plaintiff was a bona fide extender of credit, which perfected its security interest. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged their convictions of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute more than 3.5 grams of freebase cocaine. Defendants contended that the trial court erred in its refusal to enforce the plea agreement. The court held that the pleas of guilty were not entered on the record before the state withdrew its offer and defendants were not prejudiced in asserting any defense by the state's change in position. Defendants argued for relief based on underrepresentation of women grand jury forepersons. The court held that there was no intentional discrimination against women and was unable to see the slightest prejudice to defendants by reason of this underrepresentation. Defendants asserted that they were detained and questioned and were not given Miranda warnings before they were requested to consent to open the trunk. Knowledge of the right to be assisted by counsel and to remain silent had little bearing on the voluntariness of a consent to a search. Further, there was no constitutional right to select an attorney who was not a member of the New Jersey bar. The court affirmed the judgments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment by Superior Court of New Jersey, Monmouth County, which convicted him of murder, N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant strangled his girl friend. They had been living together for about four months and planned to get married. The jury rejected defendant's insanity defense and found him guilty of murder, N.J. Stat.

Ann. &sect; 2C:20-3(a). Two psychiatrists testified, one for each side. The defense psychiatrist testified that defendant suffered from schizophrenia, a mental disease that the psychiatrist believed rendered defendant unable to formulate an intent to knowingly or willfully to kill the victim. The trial judge refused to charge the jury on diminished capacity as a defense because the judge believed that the defense no longer was available. The court held that the present statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:4-2, required the trial judge to determine whether the evidence of diminished capacity was of sufficient substance to be admissible. If the trial judge was so persuaded, the evidence would have been admissible and state would be required to overcome it at trial beyond a reasonable doubt. The court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court which convicted defendant of murder, robbery, kidnapping, and burglary was affirmed. Evidence of diminished capacity was not of sufficient capacity to be admissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder in 1968 and became eligible for parole in 1984.

Appellant sought review, and the court affirmed. The court found that imposing future parole eligibility pursuant to regulations adopted under the Act had not been ex post facto even though the Act was enacted 11 years after appellant's conviction. The court held the imposition of future parole eligibility had not been ex post facto because the regulations adopted under the Act had not been more onerous than those in effect at the time of appellant's offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff municipal utilities authority challenged the trial court's order in favor of defendant New Jersey Spill Compensation Fund administrator on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment in plaintiff's action seeking a declaration that N.J.

Plaintiff contended that defendant was strictly liable, that it was entitled to landfill cleanup and removal costs, and that the trial court erred in finding that N.J. Stat.

The court affirmed the trial court's order, holding that &sect; 58:10-23.11g(a) was prospective and excluded recovery for damages resulting from pre-Spill Act discharges, because the high cost of cleanup and the fact that the Spill Act was an innovative statute made it likely the legislature intended a cautious approach rather than an all-inclusive one.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 30:4D-20 et seq., but were denied benefits because they were under age 65 and did not receive federal social security benefits. On appeal, the court held that appellee Department of Human Services did not err in interpreting N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:4D-21 to require receipt of social security benefits as a prerequisite to receipt of PAAD. The eligibility regulations were based on fiscal necessity and were consistent with governing legislation, thus N.J. Admin. Code tit. 10, &sect; 69A-6.2(a), which set forth the prerequisite, was valid. N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:4D-21 did not violate the equal protection provisions of U.S. Const. amend. XIV or N.J. Const. art. I, para. 1, because the state's ability to rely on social security administrative determinations was fundamental to the integrity of the PAAD program and its financial ability to provide benefits. Therefore, the classification excluding the disabled needy under 65 not receiving social security was rational. Administrative convenience or expense was a justifiable and rational basis for the prerequisite.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Atlantic County, which affirmed his conviction by the municipal court for driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, and denied his motion to suppress the evidence produced by the stop, claiming an unconstitutional stop and seizure of his person under the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state trooper observed defendant slowly driving his vehicle on the northbound shoulder of a highway, late at night, with his left-turn indicator flashing. After observing defendant operating his vehicle in this manner for one-tenth of a mile, the trooper stopped the vehicle. When the trooper approached the car and talked with the driver, he made observations which resulted in the charge and conviction for driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:4-50. Defendant sought to suppress the evidence produced by the stop, claiming an unconstitutional stop and seizure of his person under the state and federal constitutions. Defendant's motion was denied and he was found guilty in his initial trial in the municipal court and was again found guilty after a trial de novo in the law division. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of his motion to suppress because the facts were unusual enough for the time and place to warrant the closer scrutiny of a momentary investigative stop and inquiry. The court refused to substitute its judicial hindsight for what appeared to be a sound, nonpretextual exercise of curbstone judgment by the officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion to suppress evidence produced by a stop which led to his conviction for driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol because the officer had reason to believe the circumstances were enough beyond the ordinary, though not necessarily criminally suspicious, that the vehicle stop was constitutionally permissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant township sought review of a decision of the Tax Court (New Jersey), which concluded that the Pinelands Protection Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:18A-1 et seq., demonstrated a substantial depressing influence and ordered tax assessments lowered from $ 774,200 to $ 573,188 for 1981 and $ 450,362 for 1982, in plaintiff landowners' appeal of their tax assessment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners appealed their tax assessments. The lower court concluded that the Pinelands Protection Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:18A-1 et seq., demonstrated a substantial depressing influence and ordered tax assessments lowered from $ 774,200 to $ 572,188 for 1981 and $ 450,362 in 1982. On appeal, the court affirmed. The inconsistent speculation about whether there was any realistic possibility of the development of plaintiffs' lands, and whether any prospects for development influenced their value was because there was no certified local master plan and so it was impossible to say how many homesites plaintiffs were allowed to develop, or if any, or under what restrictions. The reason for that was that defendant failed to satisfy its statutory obligation to produce a master plan conforming with comprehensive management plan, and plaintiffs had not applied to the Pinelands Commission for permission to develop. In the absence of such evidence, the lower court was allowed to find that developability was so speculative an element as to have no influence on value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the lower court, which held that an environmental act depressed plaintiff landowners' property and ordered his tax assessments lowered because, in the absence of evidence of consistent speculation about whether there was any realist possibility of the development of plaintiffs' lands, the lower court was allowed to find that developability was so speculative an element as to have no influence on value.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant New Jersey Commissioner of Education promulgated rules requiring the admission of students with the AIDS/ARC and HLTV-III antibody into regular classroom attendance, with specific, limited exceptions, and specifically directed plaintiff school boards to place certain kindergarten-aged students into the regular classroom. Plaintiffs filed law suits challenging the orders and the guidelines, with one of the cases adjudicated in favor of defendant, from which that plaintiff appealed, and the other being granted a leave to appeal. The cases were consolidated and stays were issued. The court reversed defendant's orders, remanded for hearings, and continued the stays pending hearings and the redeterminations of defendant. The court held that the guidelines were null and void as they were not promulgated in compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:14B et seq., as defendant's intention was for the guidelines to have wide coverage and were to operate prospectively. As for the specific orders, plaintiffs were not provided an opportunity to be heard or to submit evidence pursuant to N.J. Admin. Code tit. 6, &sect; 24-1.11 and N.J. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizens group organized to secure signatures to force the recall election of the mayor. Respondent New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission held that appellant was a political committee within the meaning of the New Jersey Campaign Contributions and Expenditures Reporting Act (act), N.J.

The court held that appellant was subject to the act because the placement of the recall question on the ballot was part and parcel of the passage of the question. The court held that the collection of signatures and filing of a petition aided or promoted the passage of a public question. The court held that the petition process was as much a part of the overall electoral process as the voting itself. The court held that to campaign to get a public question on a ballot was to promote its passage.

Ann. &sect; 2A:164-6 of the Sex Offender Act (repealed), to a diagnostic and treatment center for indeterminate terms not to exceed 30 years. Five years later, defendant sought to be resentenced pursuant to the provisions of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:1-1d(2) of the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice (Code), claiming that he qualified for a sentence reduction. His application was denied. Defendant alleged that the prohibition against his earning commutation time for good behavior and work performed, which was contained in &sect; 2A:164-6, was no longer applicable to him because the statute was expressly repealed and &sect; 2C:1-1d(2) was meant to control his treatment. The court held that at the time of the imposition of defendant's sentence, there existed an express prohibition on the award of commutation credits to sex offenders, and awarding those credits later would have undermined the legislative purpose of the provision. The court affirmed and held that defendant's equal protection rights were not violated because he was not a member of the same class or similarly situated to persons serving sentences under the Code.</SPAN></P>

Affirming defendant's conviction for driving with a blood alcohol concentration of .10 percent or more in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:4-50(a), the court held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting the breathalyzer inspection certificates because they were admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule and were properly authenticated. The court also held that the statute was constitutional and that the state proved the necessary elements of its case. The court reasoned that it was not necessary for the state to prove defendant's blood alcohol level at the time when he was driving because such an interpretation, although within the literal terms of the statute, produced anomalous results not intended by the legislature. The court found that the statute focused on the operation of a vehicle when there was sufficient alcohol in the driver's system to produce the proscribed reading so long as there was no further ingestion of alcohol between the time of operation and the time of testing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant administratrix's decedent was killed in Louisiana in an accident involving a machine made in New Jersey by respondent manufacturer. Appellant commenced suit in Louisiana against a party that did not make the machine. The Louisiana court entered summary judgment for the party on that basis. When appellant ascertained the true manufacturer, Louisiana's one-year statute of limitations barred suit in that state. Appellant commenced an action against respondent within the period permitted by New Jersey's two-year statute of limitations, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:14-2. The trial court granted respondent's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action. The court affirmed the dismissal, holding that the trial court correctly determined that Louisiana's one-year statute of limitations governed the action. The court concluded that Louisiana's statute applied because its interest in the action outweighed New Jersey's interest. The parties were all present in or amenable to Louisiana's jurisdiction. The fact that respondent manufactured the allegedly faulty machine in New Jersey did not create an interest sufficient for application of New Jersey's statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to a series of thefts and in sentencing defendant, the trial court ordered restitution. After the court reversed and remanded the restitution order, the trial court increased the order in implementing the remand instructions, and defendant again appealed, arguing that increase of the order constituted double jeopardy, and violated his plea bargain. The court affirmed and ruled that double jeopardy principles did not apply to restitution because restitution was not technically punishment for a crime. The court ruled that, although restitution had aspects of rehabilitation and deterrence, which were also aspects of punishment, it was predominantly nonpenal in nature, and thus there was no constitutional infringement by an increase in restitution after appeal. The court also ruled that the plea agreement did not address the issue of restitution, nor was it required to be addressed by a plea agreement, although the better practice would have been for the trial court to have addressed the matter in the colloquy at the time the plea was accepted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant was convicted of felony-murder, he sought review of an order from the Superior Court, Hudson County (New Jersey), sentencing him to a 30-year minimum incarceration without parole eligibility as mandated by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3b.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This appeal involved the issue of whether the 30-year minimum sentence without parole eligibility mandated by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3b for felony murder convictions was constitutional. Appellant was convicted of felony-murder for stabbing a woman to death during a robbery. He was sentenced to a minimum term of 30 years during which he would not be eligible for parole. On review, appellant argued that the statute establishing the minimum sentence violated the federal and state constitutions' prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The court disagreed. According to the court, when applying the tests for cruel and unusual punishment, which have been judicially created, to the sentencing provision of the New Jersey statute, the proper inquiry was whether the 30-year mandatory minimum sentence for murder went beyond what was necessary to accomplish any legitimate penal aim, or if it was a reasonable expedient to achieve the public purpose that could be deduced from the legislation. Here, the court affirmed the sentence imposed because it concluded that the 30-year requirement met these tests and found that the statute was therefore constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's 30-year minimum sentence for felony-murder as required by New Jersey statute was affirmed because the court concluded that the statute did not violate either the state or federal constitution in that the punishment was a reasonable expedient to achieve the legitimate penal purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juveniles were charged with conduct that if committed by adults would constitute murder, robbery, burglary of two victim's home, and aggravated sexual assault. The lower court held a detention hearing at which it determined that there was probable cause to believe that appellants committed the alleged conduct. The juvenile court referred appellants to the law division for trial as adults because they did not show that it was likely that they would be rehabilitated by age 19 under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:4A-26. Appellants challenged this ruling and the court affirmed. One appellant argued that &sect; 2A:4A-26&nbsp;unconstitutionally required him to disprove facts that supported waiver, because the facts were also the elements of the offense. The court disagreed, holding that the statutes upon which that appellant relied in support of his claim applied to the criminal, but not the juvenile code. The court rejected the argument that the trial court erred in denying appellants an evidentiary hearing before it waived jurisdiction because the trial court reviewed the record of the detention hearing.</SPAN></P>

A jury was sworn, and the prosecutor and defense counsel gave opening statements. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the indictment because the prosecutor's opening was insufficient. The court granted defendants' motion, and the state appealed. The reviewing court found that a prosecutor was required to make an opening statement in a criminal action but that there were no requirements as to what the opening should state. The court noted that criminal cases should not be decided prematurely because a dismissal on the opening was not appealable and would preclude retrial on double jeopardy grounds. The state contended that because the judge ruled on matters of law only, retrial was not prohibited and that, even if the defendants technically were acquitted because the jury was not discharged, no retrial was required. The court held that the dismissal of the indictments acquitted defendants of the charges and that the jury had been impaneled and sworn. Therefore, double jeopardy had attached, and the appeal was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and dismissed plaintiff's complaint. The court found that defendant's limitations defense was properly stricken because N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:82-4.3, the limitations statute, violated the Full Faith and Credit Clause of U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1. Next, the court found that the Puerto Rico judgment was defective and not entitled to full faith and credit and that no New Jersey judgment should have been based upon it. Full faith and credit was available only to judgments based upon notice that was reasonably calculated to have apprised defendant of the action's pendency and that afforded defendant an opportunity to present a defense. Defendant's notice was defective because it did not include an English translation. Moreover, plaintiff's counsel had default judgment entered despite having a copy of defendant's answer and knowing that defendant planned to oppose the claim, and courts could vacate judgments procured by mistake or fraud.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff company sought site plan approval for a convenience store. Defendant board denied preliminary and final approval because the store was not &quot;low traffic generating,&quot; as required by the preamble to the ordinance. The trial court reversed and granted final site plan approval. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the preamble could neither limit nor extend the meaning of a statute that was clear on its face, and that the term &quot;low traffic generating&quot; lacked interpretative standards. The court held that the power to deny a site plan because of traffic was an exercise of the zoning power vested in the municipal governing body, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55D-2, 62. The court held that the convenience store was a permitted use, which required preliminary site plan approval. N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55D-46b. The court affirmed the trial court's order insofar as it granted preliminary site plan approval, but reversed and remanded to the trial court for imposition of reasonable conditions (such as parking, loading, and traffic restrictions, including the pro rata share of any street improvements) insofar as the order granted final site plan approval.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, The American Physical Therapy Association, New Jersey Chapter, appealed from the promulgation of a regulation, N.J. Admin. Code tit. 13, &sect; 35-6.14, by defendant, New Jersey State Board of Medical Examiners. Plaintiff contended that the regulation was ultra vires since the authority to regulate the actions of medical assistants performing physical therapy functions rested solely with plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from the promulgation of N.J. Admin. Code tit. 13, &sect; 35-6.14 by defendant New Jersey State Board of Medical Examiners, plaintiff, The American Physical Therapy Association, New Jersey Chapter, contended that because the definition of physical therapy in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 45:9-37.14a had previously been held constitutional, the regulation of the actions of medical assistants performing functions which would fit the definitions of physical therapy was under its exclusive jurisdiction. The court disagreed and affirmed the promulgation of the regulation. The court held that the regulation in question clearly governed an aspect of the practice of medicine, i.e., the delegation of the use of simple modalities of physical therapy as part of medical treatment within the physician's office. This aspect of medicine was similar to, but yet different, from the unsupervised application of physical therapy by a licensed physical therapist exercising professional judgment. Further, defendant was empowered pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 45:9-2 to provide standards for the practice of medicine. Therefore, defendant had jurisdiction to promulgate the challenged regulation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the action of defendant, New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners, in adopting N.J. Admin. Code. tit. 13, &sect; 35-6.14. The court held that although the regulation addressed certain activities that fit the definition of physical therapy, it also clearly governed an aspect of the practice of medicine, and therefore, plaintiff, The American Physical Therapy Association, New Jersey Chapter, did not have exclusive jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court, Law Division, Gloucester County (New Jersey), affirming defendants', mayor and city council's, dismissal of plaintiff as their acting chief of police based upon disciplinary charges and plaintiff's alleged interference with an ongoing criminal investigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, who was the acting chief of police, was dismissed by defendants, the mayor and city council, after disciplinary charges were brought against him. Plaintiff was found guilty of interfering with an ongoing criminal investigation. The trial court affirmed plaintiff's dismissal. The court reversed, holding that the amendment to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:14-150 did not limit de novo hearings to the record before the disciplinary board, but permitted a party to supplement the record with additional testimony at a de novo hearing. Therefore, the trial court erred in precluding plaintiff from presenting additional testimony at his hearing. Furthermore, defendants had no authority under a city ordinance to conduct the disciplinary hearing at which plaintiff was dismissed. Such authority was vested in the director or in the disciplinary board selected from among the members of the police force.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal of plaintiff as the acting chief of police was reversed because the trial court erred in precluding the presentation of additional testimony at the trial court level hearing. Furthermore, the authority to conduct the disciplinary hearing in the first place was not vested in defendant mayor and city council, but in the police disciplinary board.</SPAN></P>
