</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff provided cable television access in defendant city for 20 years. When plaintiff's franchise expired, defendant held public hearings and decided to provide cable television services itself, rather than award the franchise to a privately-owned bidder. Plaintiff sued in federal court, challenging defendant's ability to own and operate a cable television system. The federal court held that the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 546, was inapplicable to the facts but abstained from deciding state constitutional issues, which were certified to the state's highest court, which held in favor of defendant city. N.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 2(1) authorized the state legislature to pass statutes defining &quot;public enterprise&quot; to include cable television systems and to grant cities the authority to own and operate them. The court broadly construed the term &quot;public purpose&quot; to include services offered in direct competition with those provided by privately-owned corporations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state's highest court affirmed, holding that municipal operation of a cable television service was authorized by the state constitution and statutes because it fell within the definition of a &quot;public purpose.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff governor and defendants, judges, elections board, and lawyers association, appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Wake County (North Carolina), which granted in part and denied in part the parties' respective motions for summary judgment in the governor's action challenging the constitutionality of 1987 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 509. The parties' petition for discretionary review, prior to the court of appeals' decision, was allowed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The governor sought a declaration that certain provisions of Chapter 509 violated the state constitution. The provisions challenged increased the number of superior court judicial districts, changed the election dates for nine judgeships to eliminate staggered terms, and imposed residency requirements. The trial court held that, to the extent that Chapter 509 extended the terms of some judgeships and designated the incumbent judge to hold over, it was unconstitutional. Summary judgment was granted for the governor on this issue. As to all other provisions, summary judgment was granted for defendants. Appeal followed, and the court reversed the judgment in part and affirmed it in part. The state constitution did not specify when judicial elections were to be held, but it did have a holdover provision. Thus, the creation of a one-time delay of elections and a one-time interim, between terms, was constitutional. Because the incumbent judges were assigned to subdivisions of the former district for which they were elected, the residency requirement was maintained. The pre-candidacy residency requirement did not unconstitutionally deny qualified candidates the right to seek office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment insofar as it held that the one-time delay of elections and one-time hiatus, between terms, violated the state constitution. Thus, the injunctive relief granted by the trial court was dissolved. The court, however, affirmed the remaining parts of the trial court's judgment which declared that the other provisions of the challenged legislation did not violate the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the changing of the zoning ordinance was not a taking, because the land maintained a practical use and a reasonable value. Also, the zoning ordinance had a substantial relation to public health and welfare. Finally, there was no guarantee to the landowners that the ordinance would not be changed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Evidence indicated that the victim had been killed by manual strangulation during involuntary sexual intercourse. The court rejected defendant's numerous points of error with regard to both the guilt and penalty phases of his trial. The remoteness of an incident testified to regarding an attempted rape and manual strangulation which had occurred more that ten years previous was outweighed by the relevancy provided by the similarities to the incident for which defendant was on trial. Moreover, defendant failed to object at trial, and because he did not show a reasonable possibility that had the testimony been excluded, a different result would have been reached at his trial, he could not have met the even heavier burden imposed by the test for plain error. The particular circumstances of the crime, including having struck the victim with a large stick several times in the head, forcing her to disrobe, forcing intercourse with her while she was semi-conscious, strangling her in the midst of sexual intercourse, hiding the body, and going home to sleep rather than seeking medical attention for the victim were sufficient for the jury to find defendant guilty of first degree murder.</SPAN></P>

In doing so, it noted that counsel did not have the right to inquire into all aspect of the panel's religious beliefs. The court also rejected defendant's claim that there was prosecutorial error throughout the trial which required reversal, noting that the actions of the prosecutor were either within legal limits, or that they did not reach the level of gross impropriety required for reversal. The court found that defendant failed to meet the required test with respect to his claim that his trial counsel was ineffective. The court also found that the trial court properly instructed the jury on mitigating and aggravating circumstances, that the jury's finding with respect to each was supported by the evidence, that the death sentence was not disproportionate or the result of passion on the jury's part.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners claimed that the per capita method resulted in a 93 percent decrease in sales tax revenues, which forced the municipality to raise taxes and reduce services. They first argued that the method denied them equal protection by creating an arbitrary distinction between those who resided in the county more than six months of the year and those who resided primarily elsewhere. The court disagreed, and found that individuals owning second homes in resort areas were not a downtrodden minority or a suspect class. Nor did the increase in taxes and reduction in services discourage citizens of other counties from purchasing property in the town, thereby violating their right to travel, because property owners, resident and nonresident alike, were equally affected. The court concluded that the statute neither operated to the disadvantage of a suspect class nor interfered with the exercise of a fundamental right, and declined to apply strict scrutiny. The court further concluded that the method was rationally related to a legitimate state interest in that it provided a reasonable means of returning revenues in an amount proportionate to those from whom they were collected.</SPAN></P>

They had been assessed civil penalties by NRCD for prior violations. The court of appeals concluded that the Act constituted a legislative grant of judicial power prohibited by N.C. Const. art. IV, &sect; 3 did not permit an administrative agency to assess a civil penalty whose amount varied with any agency discretion. The court held that N.C. Const. art. IV, &sect; 3 contemplated that discretionary judicial authority could be granted to an agency when reasonably necessary to accomplish the agency's purposes. The legislature was thus not prohibited from conferring the power on administrative agencies to assess civil penalties, or to exercise discretion in determining civil penalties within an authorized range. The court also determined a panel of the court of appeals was bound by a prior decision of another panel of the same court on the same issue. The court concluded that the civil penalty power was reasonably necessary to the purposes for which NRCD was established.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences. Defendant appealed as a matter of right pursuant to N.C. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The jury returned a guilty verdict for first degree murder based on malice, premeditation, and deliberation. The trial court concluded that the jury's failure to return a guilty verdict under the felony murder rule precluded submitting the aggravating circumstance to the jury that the murder took place while defendant was committing burglary. Defendant threatened to kill his wife and beat her, breaking her ribs. When the wife was released from the hospital, she took her children and went to stay with her mother and stepfather, the victim. Defendant argued with the victim about visiting his children and killed him with three gunshot wounds. The court pointed out there was no double jeopardy because first degree burglary and first degree murder each required proof of another fact which the other did not. The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred by finding, in aggravation of the burglary sentence, that the crime occurred while on pretrial release from another felony. The court found no error in the State's use of peremptory challenges to remove jurors who were not Witherspoon excludables but were ambivalent about imposing the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner gas corporation sought review of an order issued by respondent, the North Carolina Utilities Commission (commission), which concluded that the value of gas-in-kind retained by the corporation was revenue; that the corporation was required to refund money collected pursuant to a line loss and compressor fuel charge previously assessed from other customers; and that the money collected be included in a margin protection account.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An &quot;Industrial Sales Tracker&quot; (IST) account was established to protect the corporation's margins. On the corporation's appeal of the commission's order, the court affirmed the order. Specifically, the commission's decision, that the value of gas-in-kind retained by the corporation was treatable as transportation revenues, was not arbitrary or capricious. Nor was it unsupported by the evidence. Because the IST rider was a part of the corporation's rate structure, it was proper to flow the overcharge into the IST. In addition, the court found that the commission had not engaged in retroactive ratemaking in excess of the commission's authority because the order did not require the corporation to refund monies that it was properly authorized to collect. Finally, the court decided that the commission's actions did not amount to an impairment of contract or an unlawful taking of property in violation of the state or federal Constitutions. The commission was only enforcing its prior order, and there was no taking without due process when the commission's order was reasonable and its benefit to the public outweighed any deprivation of the corporation's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

The announcement of that determination in open court constituted entry of judgment for purposes of determining when notice of appeal had to be given, even if a formal written order was not filed until a later date. The state neither gave oral notice of appeal at the hearing nor filed a written notice of appeal within 10 days following the ruling. Thus, the court held that the state lost its right to appeal because it failed to give timely notice. The court further held that the trial court's ruling that respondent was not mentally ill concluded the case or controversy between the state and the respondent. The court held that upon that determination respondent was entitled to be released from the facility under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 122C-223 (1986).

The jury found in aggravation that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious and cruel. On appeal, the court held the trial court did not err in failing to sequester witnesses, allowing the state to use its peremptory challenges to dismiss jurors opposed to the death penalty, or by allowing defendant's doctor's testimony that his wounds were self-inflicted. Nor was it error to exclude defendant's hearsay statements that the victim stabbed him. The trial court's instructions on mitigating circumstances allowed the jury to consider statutory as well as non-statutory mitigating factors, and it was free to disregard nonstatutory mitigating circumstances under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(f)(9)(1988). The court concluded defendant's trial was fair and free of prejudicial error, the evidence supported the aggravating circumstance, and the death sentence was proportionate and not excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The adoptive mother and daughter were the subjects of a true story about carnival workers who had abandoned their daughter as an infant and left her with a babysitter, identified as the adoptive mother. The adoptive mother and daughter claimed that the public disclosure of these acts caused them embarrassment and that they had to seek counseling as a result. The journalist and newspaper claimed that the tort of public disclosure of private facts should not be recognized by the common law of North Carolina. The court agreed and reversed. The court held that tort was not recognized by the common law and that decisions of the United States Supreme Court, scholarly articles, and the Restatement of Torts made it clear that the private facts branch of the invasion of privacy tort was, at the very best, constitutionally suspect. Further, the branch of the tort that the court was asked to adopt would duplicate or overlap other torts, such as the intentional infliction of emotional distress. Since the adoptive mother and daughter would only be entitled to recover once, if at all, it seemed that recognition of the private facts tort would deliver nothing of any real value.</SPAN></P>

After he was treated for wounds to his forehead and buttocks, defendant orally waived his Miranda rights, but refused to sign a written waiver because his head injury prevented him from seeing the waiver form. Defendant then confessed to the crime. Finding no error in either the guilt or sentencing phase, the state supreme court affirmed defendant's conviction and death sentence. Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(d)(2) (1983), the court first held that the record supported the aggravating circumstances that defendant previously had been convicted of a felony involving violence and that the murder was committed against a deputy sheriff while engaged in the performance of official duties. Next, nothing in the record suggested that the death sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. Finally, given the facts of the case and defendant's history, the death sentence was not an excessive or disproportionate penalty.</SPAN></P>

N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-14 did not apply to the taking of the blood sample from defendant. There were no exigent circumstances to justify a warrantless search, and no search warrant authorizing the taking of defendant's blood was issued. Obtaining the sample of defendant's blood violated his rights under N.C. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals (North Carolina) reversed a trial court order denying plaintiff landowners' action for a declaratory judgment against defendants, an adjoining landowner and the members of the Board of Commissioners of Guilford County (board).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The adjoining landowner sold a parcel to the landowners, upon which the latter constructed a home. Throughout this time, the landowner carried out grain drying and storing and the sale and distribution of agricultural chemicals from his property across the street, which was zoned A-1 Agricultural. When the adjoining landowner expanded his business operations to additional land he owned next to the landowners, the landowners filed a complaint with the county inspections department. As a result, the adjoining landowner was informed that his tract constituted an impermissible expansion of a nonconforming use. The landowner successfully sought a conditional use permit. The court held 1) while the rezoning admittedly constituted a form of spot zoning, it was legal because there was a reasonable basis for the county's action--the degree of public benefit created by the zoning action and the similarity of the proposed use of the tracts under the new conditional use zone to the uses in the surrounding areas, and 2) the zoning was not illegal contract zoning because the zoning authority neither entered into a bilateral contract nor abandoned its position as an independent decision-maker.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the court of appeals' decision and remanded the case to that court for further remand to the trial court for reinstatement of the original judgment denying the landowners' action for a declaratory judgment and affirming the zoning action of the board.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals granted him a new trial on seven of the eight counts and remanded for entry of a new judgment on the eighth count. The state appealed. The court reversed as to four counts and upheld the judgment on the three remaining counts. The items in the first four counts fell within the plain view doctrine. Before the search, police officers did not have probable cause to believe that they would be found, but when they saw the items during the search, they had probable cause to believe that they were evidence of criminal conduct because they were listed in county incident reports. The last three counts pertained to items about which police officers had to consult city police after the search had occurred. Because they had no probable cause at the time of the search, the evidence was improperly admitted and new trials were properly granted.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the court held that because the underlying felony was the murder of another person, the trial court could not impose an additional sentence upon defendant by sentencing him separately for that murder. The court also held that the trial court did not err in excluding defendant's self-serving statement that was solely in the possession of defendant's attorney. The court held that the state's evidence did not show and defendant failed to produce any evidence to show heat of passion on sudden provocation, thus the trial court did not err by failing to submit the possible verdicts of voluntary manslaughter.</SPAN></P>

The court began with the presumption that the statute was constitutional and concluded that the statute did not obstruct the retailer's fundamental right to earn a living as guaranteed by &sect;&sect; 1 and 19. The court held that the statute was rationally related to a proper governmental purpose. Under the test it applied, the court found that the statute involved a distinguishing feature from other types of retail sales because it regulated military equipment that was not manufactured for civilian consumers, and the statute's licensing scheme protected against unauthorized transfers of military property. Using that same analysis, the court found that the statute did not violate the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Also, the statute did not create improper classifications under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it was reasonably based on the difference between military property and civilian goods.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment that found the state statute that regulated military property sales by civilian retailers unconstitutional. The court found that the statute was rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose, and that it neither violated the due process or equal protection clauses of either the state or federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The court allowed the state's petition for discretionary review. The trial court had sustained the state's objection to the proffered testimony of defendant's expert witness that in his opinion the average person in the community would not find the magazines sold by defendant to be patently offensive. The court found that the expert witness's study had not gathered any data which would have indicated whether the average adult applying contemporary community standards would find the materials to be patently offensive. The court concluded that the trial court had not abused its discretion in excluding the proffered expert testimony, either on the ground that it would not assist the jury in understanding the evidence or determining a fact in issue, or on the ground that defendant had failed to establish a proper basis for the expert's opinion testimony as to any fact in issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court awarded a new trial to defendant because the trial court's refusal at each phase of the murder trial to permit both counsel for defendant to address the jury at final argument constituted prejudicial error per se. Both counsel for defendant were entitled to address the jury at each point at which defendant had the right to present argument to the jury. Although the number of defense attorneys allowed to address the jury could be limited to three under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 84-14, the trial court could not otherwise restrict defendant's right to argue to the jury. The court held that the prejudicial error also applied to the noncapital charges because they were joined with the murder charge for trial. Therefore, defendant was entitled to a new trial on all charges. The court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred by denying his motion to prohibit the state from peremptorily challenging black jurors. The trial court also properly denied defendant's motion to require the court reporter to note the race of every potential juror examined.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-34.1. Defendant fired 14 shots, one of which entered a vehicle and killed the occupant. The superior court denied defendant's application for appropriate relief. The court found no error. Any rational trier of fact could have found that defendant intended to fire into the vehicle from the evidence that defendant pointed the pistol toward the vehicle and fired the pistol. Defendant's exculpatory statement that he did not intend to shoot into the vehicle was contradicted by evidence that he fired the pistol at the vehicle. Defendant's exculpatory statement did not entitle him to have the case dismissed. The intentional firing into a vehicle, which defendant knew to be occupied, supported a finding that the act was done in reckless disregard of the rights and safety of others. Because 13 or 14 shots were fired in the direction of the vehicle, a reasonable man could conclude that one of them was likely to have entered the vehicle.

The defendant was charged in bills of indictment, proper in form, with robbery with a dangerous weapon and murder of Burton B.

Following a sentencing hearing held pursuant to N.C.G.S. &sect; 15A-2000, the jury recommended that the defendant be sentenced to death for the murder conviction.

On review from that judgment, the court noted that the definition of the term, &quot;companions&quot; included individuals who provided assistance to the young and the infirm as well as &quot;escorts,&quot; who were widely believed to provide sexual services. The court concluded that the appeals court correctly determined that the ordinance's regulation of &quot;companions&quot; was overbroad and violated N.C. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 19. Those provisions required that government regulations of trades and businesses have a rational relationship to a substantial government purpose. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment upholding the decision to enjoin the county, the county sheriff, and the county tax collector from enforcing the ordinance regulating companion services. The adult entertainment company sought the injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Durham County (North Carolina), which convicted defendant of two counts of first degree rape, first degree kidnapping, assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious bodily injury, and assault with a deadly weapon. Defendant was sentenced to two consecutive life terms for the rapes, 30 years for the kidnapping, and eight years for the assaults.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court allowed defendant to bypass the appellate court in appeals from convictions of kidnapping and two assaults. The court held that the trial court's admission of evidence which tended to show that he made a local phone call from the city where the crimes took place was harmless error. The court held that the purpose of the evidence was to discredit defendant's alibi defense, and the state had already presented considerable evidence to the same effect. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the trial court did not err in instructing that the jury could convict him of the rape if it found that he employed a dangerous weapon or that he inflicted serious injury upon the victim. The court remanded for resentencing, holding that double jeopardy principles precluded defendant's conviction for both first degree kidnapping and the first degree rapes. The court held that the jury may have used one of the rapes to elevate the kidnapping from second to first degree. The court held that the trial court could arrest judgment on the first degree kidnapping conviction and resentence defendant for second degree kidnapping or it could arrest judgment on one of the rape convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1982, plaintiff town obtained a permit from defendant state and constructed a vehicular ramp over sand dunes and accreted lands.

Plaintiffs, town and individuals, brought a declaratory judgment action to challenge the constitutionality of ch. 539. The trial court granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. The appellate court affirmed that ch. 539 was a local act in violation of N.C. Const. art II, &sect; 24, but reversed the portion of the trial court's decision allowing severance of the unconstitutional sections of the act and held that the act could not be severed. The court reversed and remanded and held that ch. 539 did not violate the North Carolina Constitution because ch. 539 was a general law and not a local act. Since the act was a not a local act, it did not violate N.C. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 3. Restrictions on vehicular traffic contained in ch. 539 were intended to promote the general welfare of the public and were reasonably based to further that intent.</SPAN></P>

Defendants made a motion to bypass the appellate court, which the court allowed. Plaintiffs asserted that the Chapel Hill Act, passed by the General Assembly, was unconstitutional because it was a local act regulating trade and because it permitted the city to engage in a joint venture not for public purpose, which was prohibited by the state constitution. The court held that plaintiffs' contention that their standing remained an issue was without merit, that the Chapel Hill Act (Act), 1984 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 961, did not regulate trade in violation of the N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 249(j), that the agreement between defendant city and a development company did not create a joint venture, and that defendant city had the power to convey air rights. Although the Act may have had some impact upon trade, it did not regulate trade because all it did was empower the city to engage in economic development projects, and set no rules for, nor established any, control over any activity that could have been fairly called trade.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that his motion to quash the indictment should have been granted on the ground that the jury was not selected from a representative cross section of the community. Defendant argued that the process for assigning numbers to potential jurors resulted in a disproportionately large number of rural jurors and that 51.3 percent of blacks did not have rural addresses in the county. The court rejected this argument, holding the county was largely rural, the cities were small, and that urban dwellers did not constitute a distinct group in that county. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred by instructing the jury that it could infer malice, thereby relieving the State of its burden of proof on that issue. The court disagreed, holding that it was proper to infer malice where the jury found certain predicate facts: premeditation, intent, and use of a deadly weapon. The jury was instructed that it must find those facts beyond a reasonable doubt. Furthermore, the court noted that there was little of no evidence of sudden passion, adequate provocation, or self-defense. If the necessary predicate facts were found, it was appropriate for the jury to infer malice.</SPAN></P>

The church brought an action to enjoin enforcement of the zoning ordinance of defendant city. The intermediate appellate court affirmed a trial court judgment that the ordinance was valid. The court affirmed and determined that the zoning ordinance bore a reasonable relation to the legitimate objectives of the police power by assisting with drainage, prevention of erosion, and appearance. The court also determined that the church had asserted an injury so that it had standing to litigate the question of equal protection, but it determined that the ordinance had not been selectively enforced either in the direct enforcement or in application that excepted facilities constructed before the effective date of the ordinance, which were &quot;grandfathered&quot; and thus not similarly situated to the church.</SPAN></P>

Given the manner of the killing, the age of the victim, her prior relationship with defendant, the disparity in their sizes, and the fact that hair was torn from the victim's scalp, the jury was entitled to believe that the defendant premeditated and deliberated, for some period of time, the killing of the victim. Given the savagery of the attack on this defenseless child, the enormous suffering that she apparently suffered, and the relative significance of the mitigating factors brought forth by defendant, the court could not say that the death penalty recommendation was excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and defendant.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not err in instructing the jury on murder in the first degree solely on the basis of lying in wait. There was ample evidence that defendant's announced intention was to kill the victim, that he walked alone to the window beside the victim's office, that he waited for the victim to bend down, that he shot the victim, and that the shot resulted in death. Even a moment's deliberate pause before the unaware victim was killed satisfied the definition of murder perpetrated by lying in wait. The court also held that there was no prejudicial error in the voir dire examination, the indictment did not fatally vary from the proof, and the trial court did not err by failing to instruct on second degree murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Superior Court, Durham County (North Carolina), after a jury trial, sentenced defendant to death for each of two convictions of murder in the first degree and to consecutive terms for convictions of robbery with a firearm and kidnapping in the first degree. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court found that there was insufficient evidence that defendant kidnapped the first of two murder victims. N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-39. The court noted that the victim was left outside an apartment, alone with his car keys, for five minutes; that he sat quietly and made no effort to leave while defendant was in the bathroom with the door closed; that he did not appear to be nervous; and that there was no apparent reason that he could not have left. Any determination that defendant restrained or removed him by force or fraud against his will would thus be speculation. The court then reasoned that a jury might treat a defendant more harshly where the aggravating circumstance was supported by armed robbery and kidnapping than where it was supported by only armed robbery. The court concluded that there was a reasonable possibility that the consideration by the jury of the kidnapping charge might have contributed to the recommendation of the death penalty. The court rejected defendant's contentions regarding a Batson claim, pretrial identification procedures, certain testimony to which defense counsel had opened the door, and alleged errors in jury instructions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the superior court that entered defendant's conviction for kidnapping. The court reversed the judgment that sentenced defendant to death for one of the two murders and the court remanded for a new sentencing hearing. The court affirmed all of the other convictions and sentences, including the death sentence for the other murder.</SPAN></P>

Despite that waiver the court reviewed the evidence and concluded that it was sufficient to submit the case to the jury. Defendant was not improperly denied a mistrial based upon his illness during trial because the trial court recessed the trial to allow him to recuperate and when the trial re-commenced defendant announced that he was well and ready to proceed. The court concluded that defendant was not denied the right to a fair and impartial verdict and no mistrial was warranted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The jury found defendant guilty of robbery with a dangerous weapon and murder in the first degree on the bases of both felony murder and malice, premeditation, and deliberation pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-17 (1986) and recommended a sentence of death. Defendant appealed from his conviction and from a judgment imposing the sentence of death entered by the Superior Court, Randolph County (North Carolina).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant alleged, inter alia, that the trial court erred in its submission of two aggravating factors to the jury. The aggravating circumstances submitted to and found by the jury in the sentencing phase of the trial were that the murder was committed while defendant was engaged in the commission of a robbery, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(e)(5), and that the murder was committed for pecuniary gain, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(e)(6). Defendant contended that submitting both factors violated due process. The court affirmed the conviction and ordered a new hearing on the sentencing phase. The court noted that under the facts of the case, where defendant was convicted of first degree murder on the basis on premeditation and deliberation, the submission of the two factors was redundant. The purpose of the robbery was pecuniary gain, and the same evidence provided proof of both factors. Because it was inequitable to submit an aggravating factor that overlapped another, and because there was a reasonable probability that the erroneous submission resulted in the jury's recommendation of capital punishment, defendant was entitled to a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's murder conviction, but ordered a new hearing on the sentencing phase.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for first degree felony murder, armed robbery, and felonious larceny, and was sentenced to death by a jury.

Defendant contended that the death sentence was excessive or disproportionate when considered against sentences imposed in similar cases. The court found no error in the proceedings, but held that the death sentence was excessive and disproportionate as a matter of law. The court set aside the trial court's death sentence and a sentence of life imprisonment was imposed. The court found mitigating evidence that the defendant suffered from impaired capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct and that he was under the influence of a mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the murder. The court concluded that the case fell within the class of crimes for which juries generally recommended life sentences and held defendant was no more deserving of death than his accomplice, who had committed the same crime in the same manner, and had received a life sentence.</SPAN></P>

The company's board of directors appointed a special litigation committee to investigate the claims to determine if it was in the best interests of the corporation to pursue litigation, but the minority shareholders filed their complaint before the investigation was completed. The court held that its inquiry into the special litigation committee's judgment was limited to whether the committee was composed of disinterested, independent directors who acted in good faith, following appropriate investigative procedures, and that the burden was on the majority shareholders to establish that the committee was disinterested. The business judgment rule provided a yardstick to achieve a balance between the need to hold management accountable for legitimate wrongs committed against the corporation and the need to ensure that management was accorded necessary decision-making discretion. The majority shareholders made every effort to insure that the members of the committee met the requisite qualifications of independence and disinterestedness.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the evidence was sufficient for one defendant's aiding and abetting of the other because he was at the scene and encouraged the assaults. The state's exclusion of black jurors through peremptory challenges did not violate defendants' equal protection rights because it was not shown that the jurors were excluded based solely on race.

Defendant confessed to the other witness that he had strangled the victim. Defendant challenged the first-degree rape conviction and the life sentence. Following the close of all evidence, the prosecutor proposed an instruction on first-degree rape. The trial court charged the jury on both degrees of the offense.

The State made a binding election not to pursue a verdict of guilty of first-degree rape, thereby assenting to an acquittal of the maximum offense arguably charged by the indictment. The court vacated defendant's conviction for first-degree rape, finding that it was error for the trial court to instruct the jury on first-degree rape, to submit that offense as a possible verdict, to enter judgment of conviction for first-degree rape, and to impose a life sentence upon that conviction.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought review. There was no error in the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress, and defendant failed to show that the trial judge abused his discretion in denying defendant's motion to continue. The court found no error in the kidnapping trial or sentencing. There was sufficient extrinsic evidence admitted at trial to support the jury's findings that the kidnapping and rape occurred in the instant case. The probative value of the evidence at issue outweighed any prejudicial effect it may have had and it was properly admitted at trial. The court arrested judgment on the rape charge, and granted defendant a new sentencing hearing on his conviction of murder in the first degree. It was error to have permitted the state's expert to testify that, in his opinion, on the night of the murder defendant was able to form the specific intent to kill the victim. Finally, the court held that there was no error in the trial judge's decision that a specific instruction on intoxication by drugs was not required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of soliciting another to commit common law robbery. Defendant was sentenced to imprisonment for seven years for conviction of a Class H felony under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-3(b) (1981). Defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals (North Carolina), which remanded the case for resentencing of defendant as a misdemeanant. The state's petition for discretionary review was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prosecution witnesses testified that defendant formed the original idea to rob the elderly victim, that he masterminded the plan, and that he counseled and enticed others to rob the victim. The victim was ultimately murdered during the robbery. At issue was whether solicitation to commit common law robbery was an infamous crime within the meaning of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-3. This statute subjected a defendant convicted of an infamous crime to punishment as a felon instead of as a misdemeanant. The court concluded that solicitation to commit common law robbery was an infamous crime within the meaning of &sect; 14-3. The court thus reversed the court of appeals on this issue. The court affirmed that part of the decision of the court of appeals finding no error in defendant's trial. The court held that infamous crimes involved moral turpitude. When a defendant counseled, enticed, or induced another to commit as degrading an offense as theft from the person or presence of a victim by force or violence by putting him in fear, he committed an act of depravity and a crime involving moral turpitude. Further, there was no error in the trial court's jury instructions or sentencing determination.</SPAN></P>

The court found that &quot;death qualifying&quot; the jury prior to the guilt phase of defendant's trial did not violate his constitutional right to a fair trial based on United States Supreme Court precedent. The court held that the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury that specific intent must be found to convict defendant of first-degree murder because N.C. Gen.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants were tried on indictments charging each with first degree sexual offense, first degree kidnapping, felonious larceny of a motor vehicle, and two counts of common law robbery.  In addition, defendant Paige was charged with first degree rape.  The defendants pleaded not guilty to all charges.  At the close of the State's evidence, the court granted a motion to dismiss the first degree kidnapping charges and submitted second degree kidnapping to the jury.  The State took a voluntary dismissal of the charges of larceny of an automobile.  The jury found the defendants guilty of all the remaining charges.  The trial court sentenced Paige to two consecutive sentences of life imprisonment for first degree rape and first degree sexual offense, plus thirty years for second degree kidnapping.  He imposed a concurrent sentence of three years for each count of common law robbery.  Lowery was sentenced to consecutive sentences of life imprisonment for first degree sexual offense and twenty years for second degree kidnapping, and to a concurrent sentence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of three years for each count of common law robbery.

On appeal, the court concluded the trial court did not err in refusing to transfer venue to the other county because all charges in the that county were dismissed prior to the hearing on the motion but that the grand jury lacked jurisdiction to indict defendants for offenses that were alleged and proved to have occurred in the county for which change of venue was sought. The indictments showed on their face that the grand jury lacked jurisdiction over the offenses charged.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Upon learning of her husband's business failure, defendant drugged and drowned the daughter. The issue was whether the prohibition against double jeopardy forbade a second trial of defendant for murder where her previous trial on the same charge had been terminated by a mistrial without findings of fact by the trial court showing that a mistrial was necessary. The court held that the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to dismiss on the ground of former jeopardy and vacated the trial court's judgment. The first trial ended during the guilt determination phase when the trial court declared a mistrial ex mero motu. Defendant contended that a retrial would unconstitutionally subject her to double jeopardy for the same offense. The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss and commenced the second trial of defendant. The court found that at the time the trial court withdrew a juror and initially declared a mistrial during defendant's first trial, no necessity existed for such action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of an order of the Court of Appeals (North Carolina), which upheld his conviction for driving while impaired in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-138.1 of the Safe Roads Act of 1983. The trial judge, authorized by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-179 to impose one of five levels of punishment, found that defendant had a prior conviction for a similar offense within seven years, a grossly aggravating factor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that because the trial judge considered as aggravating factors separate criminal offenses or elements of the charged offense, as permitted by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 20-138.1 and -179, he was denied his constitutional right to a jury trial. The court held that defendant had no standing to raise this issue regarding &sect; 20-179. The court found that because the factors before the trial judge in determining sentencing were not elements of the offense, their consideration for purposes of sentencing was a function of the judge and thus not susceptible to challenge under either the Sixth Amendment or N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 24. The court held that the legislature's amendments to the driving-while-impaired provisions in the Safe Roads Act excised all mention of prior or subsequent convictions from &sect; 20-138 and removed that element to &sect; 20-179, the sentencing provision. The court held that prior convictions were not an element of the offense but were merely one of several factors relating to punishment. The court found that the sentencing procedure of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-179 contravened neither state nor federal constitutional guarantees of a jury trial in criminal cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified and affirmed the order of the court of appeals because the factors before the trial judge in determining sentencing were not elements of the offense, their consideration for purposes of sentencing was a function of the judge and was not susceptible to constitutional challenge.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the court's non-testimonial identification order to conduct a blood-test was issued in error because defendant was already in custody and violated his constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, however, the court concluded that the trial court did not err in admitting the evidence because the court refused to apply the exclusionary rule to the good faith violation of the Fourth Amendment.

The court concluded that it had jurisdiction over the issue because the court's jurisdiction to decide questions concerning the conduct of attorneys arose out of the court's inherent power to deal with its attorneys. The court held that the trial judge erred in his conclusion because a corporation cannot perform legal services for others and if an insurance company, through its employees, would appear for an insured, it would be appearing as an attorney for someone else, in violation of the ban of &sect; 84-5.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal as of right by each defendant pursuant to N.C.G.S. &sect; 7A-27(a) from judgments entered by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Small, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 5 March 1984 Criminal Session of Wayne County Superior Court.  Defendants' motions to bypass the North Carolina Court of Appeals on the non-Class A felonies were allowed on 22 June 1984 as to defendant Rogers and on 16 August 1984 as to defendant Carraway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants were charged in indictments, proper in form, with first degree murder and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence during the guilt-innocence phase of this bifurcated trial tended to show that Charles Thurman Hall was fatally shot shortly after midnight on 21 September 1983 in an apartment building parking lot at 611 East Elm Street in Goldsboro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State's witness Captain Floyd Hobbs of the Goldsboro Police Department responded to the call concerning the East Elm Street shooting at 12:07 a.m. He proceeded to 611 East Elm Street and found the victim, Charles Hall, lying in the parking lot behind a pickup truck parked in front of Apartment 611-A.  Captain Hobbs stated that the 611 East Elm Street apartment building is a two-story brick building containing four separate apartments. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These apartments are fronted by a large parking area which adjoins Elm Street.  Apartment 611-A is the westernmost apartment.  The western boundary of the apartment parking lot is marked off by a chain link fence.  Apartment 611-D is located on the eastern side of the apartment building.  Washington's Shoe Shop is located in the extreme eastern portion of the parking lot.  Across Elm Street immediately behind a small gas station, there is a larger building which houses, among other tenants, the Pink Panther Lounge.  Captain Hobbs noted that to the left of the pickup truck, beside the fence, there was an automobile and to the right of the truck, in front of Apartment 611-B, a yellow Lincoln Continental was parked.  Hobbs observed a bullet hole in the trunk lid of the Lincoln and a bullet fragment lying near its flat left front tire.  Goldsboro Police Identification Officer Andrew Pinto testified that he removed the Continental's left front tire and found what appeared to be a bullet fragment inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeffrey Dekeyser, testifying for the State, related that on 20 September 1983 between 11:00 and 11:15 p.m. he drove his car to Blondie Coley's apartment to attend a party.  Ms. Coley resided&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in Apartment 611-A East Elm Street.  Dekeyser stated that he parked his car in front of Apartment 611-A between the fence and the pickup truck.  When he arrived, several people were standing outside the front door of Ms. Coley's apartment.  Dekeyser testified that after parking his car he walked behind the apartment building to Ms. Coley's back door.  He found more people socializing outside that door.  Dekeyser managed to walk just inside the back door but decided to go back outside after seeing the crowd within.  While standing in the doorway, Dekeyser saw George Edwards and Charles Hall near the front door making their way outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dekeyser testified that he then walked to the front of the apartment and stood at the southwest corner of the building.  He noticed Edwards and Hall talking to each other while standing in the parking lot a few feet behind the pickup truck parked in front of 611-A.  Shortly thereafter, Dekeyser observed a 1983 white Cougar turn off Elm Street and pull into the parking lot.  When the car stopped and the passenger door opened, the interior light came on enabling Dekeyser to recognize defendant Carraway as the driver of the car and defendant Rogers as the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  passenger who was leaving the vehicle.  Rogers stood up, pulled his coat back, and walked around the rear of the car towards Hall and Edwards.  Rogers walked to within three or four feet of the two men and spoke to them.  Dekeyser testified that Hall, by his hand movements, looked as if he were trying to explain something to Rogers.  Dekeyser stated that &quot;then, just like out of nowhere,&quot; he saw Rogers pull out a large caliber pistol and begin to shoot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the first shot was fired Hall fell to the ground, and as Edwards ran between the pickup truck and the Continental a second shot was fired.  At this point the witness Dekeyser ran behind the apartment building through a broken place in the fence to a carwash located on the west side of the apartment building.  He there observed the Cougar going west on Elm Street.  Dekeyser also testified that he heard a total of three shots fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SBI firearms expert James H. Evans testified that he performed tests on the bullet removed from the back seat of the Continental and the bullet found at the scene by an investigating officer.  Agent Evans found both bullets to be .44 caliber jacketed hollow-point bullets and concluded that both bullets&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were fired from the same firearm.  Sergeant C. E. Boltinhouse of the Goldsboro Police Department testified that after defendant Carraway had been arrested and released on bond she reported a .44 caliber magnum pistol missing from her house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State produced other evidence tending to show that Rogers and Edwards had argued on several previous occasions and that Rogers had physically threatened Edwards on one of those occasions at Edwards' Barber Shop.  The State also offered evidence which revealed that Rogers had been looking for Edwards at the Pink Panther Lounge prior to the shooting and had continued to look for Edwards after the shooting.  The State's case went to the jury on the theory that Rogers, with Carraway's knowing assistance, mistakenly shot Hall while attempting to murder Edwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both defendants testified in their own defense.  Defendant Carraway stated that on 20 September 1983 she and defendant Rogers returned to Goldsboro from Wilmington.  That evening, they left her 201 North George Street residence to buy some items for a sick friend.  They drove first to the Jazz-Mo Club to talk with Carraway's mother who worked there.  Outside the Club, Carraway bought a .357&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  magnum pistol from Buster King because he was selling it for a good price.  Without going inside to speak to her mother, Carraway then left and rode with Rogers to a grocery store where she bought some honey and lemon for her friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They thereafter proceeded to the service station located next to the Pink Panther Lounge to put some air in one of the Cougar's tires.  Upon finding the station closed, Rogers drove the Cougar to the 611 East Elm Street parking lot and parked near Apartment 611-C beside the Continental.  Rogers got out of the car which he had backed into a parking space and walked around the car, opening Carraway's door.  Rogers and Carraway had started back towards the Pink Panther Lounge when Edwards approached Rogers and asked for a loan of money.  When Rogers refused, Hall appeared and stated: &quot;Man if you've got any sense you'll give him all your money.&quot; When Rogers refused again, Hall pulled out a gun and began shooting.  Carraway testified that the first shot hit the Continental and that she and Rogers ducked in between the Continental and the Cougar.  Carraway stated that she heard a second shot fired and at that point reached into her pocketbook and pulled out&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  her recently purchased .357 magnum.  Carraway testified that she fired the weapon, then ran out of the parking lot towards Elm Street.  At that time, she did not know whether she had hit Hall.  Rogers then slipped into the Cougar and picked Carraway up on Elm Street.  The couple returned to her residence and left for Myrtle Beach where they intended to be married.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By his testimony defendant Rogers substantially corroborated Carraway's story.  He explained that he parked the car at 611-C because he did not want it to get scratched while they briefly went into the Pink Panther Lounge for a beer.  Rogers also denied arguing with George Edwards at his barbershop or looking for Edwards on the night before and the morning after the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants also offered the testimony of Jeffrey Fennell who stated that at approximately 8:30 or 9:30 p.m. on 20 September 1983 he was at Ed Lewis's house with George Edwards and Charles Hall.  He testified that Charles Hall was &quot;acting wild&quot; and had a weapon in his belt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the State and defendants presented evidence on rebuttal.  At the conclusion of all the testimony, and after counsel's closing arguments and the trial court's instructions to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the jury, the case was submitted to the jury.  The jury returned verdicts finding both defendants guilty of the first degree murder of Charles Hall and guilty of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill George Edwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the sentencing phase of the trial, the court submitted the following aggravating circumstance against each defendant for the jury's consideration: the murder for which the defendant stands convicted was part of a course of conduct in which the defendant engaged and which included the commission by the defendant of other crimes of violence against another person or persons.  N.C.G.S. &sect; 15A-2000(e)(11) (1983).  The court also submitted to the jury two mitigating factors for defendant Rogers and eight mitigating factors for defendant Carraway.  The jury retired and after due deliberation, returned a recommendation of death as to defendant Rogers and life imprisonment for defendant Carraway for the murder of Charles Hall.  The court imposed judgments accordingly and further imposed a ten year sentence for defendants' assault convictions to run consecutively with the sentences imposed for the murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, each defendant has brought forward numerous assignments&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of error.  When possible, similar assignments will be discussed together.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were charged with first degree murder and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill. They were convicted by the Criminal Session of the Wayne County Superior Court (North Carolina). Their motions to bypass the North Carolina Court of Appeals on review were allowed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants asserted numerous grounds for relief on appeal, including errors by the trial court during voir dire, failing to suppress certain evidence, and improper consideration of an aggravating circumstance during sentencing. The court determined that there was statutory authority for allowing the prosecution to death qualify the jury prior to the guilt-innocence phase and that reopening voir dire was within the trial court's discretion. Upon that reopening for additional questioning of a particular juror, a peremptory challenge could be used against such juror. The court held that photographic evidence was properly admitted where the witness could testify that the photograph was a fair and accurate representation of what it depicted, even though the witness had not himself taken the photograph, and the photograph had not been taken at the time of the occurrence in question. The court reversed one defendant's sentence and remanded the matter for resentencing upon a finding that the trial court's finding of an aggravating circumstance was not supported by a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant pursuant to N.C.G.S. &sect; 7A-27(a) from judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Brannon, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, entered at the 17 October 1984 Criminal Session of Wake County Superior Court, imposing a life sentence and a fine of $ 500,000 upon a jury verdict of guilty of trafficking in heroin by possessing 28 grams or more of heroin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was also convicted of conspiracy to possess 28 grams or more of heroin, conspiracy to manufacture 28 grams or more of heroin, trafficking in heroin by transporting 28 grams or more of heroin, and trafficking in heroin by manufacturing 28 grams or more of heroin.  Defendant received sentences of 45 years in prison on the verdict of manufacturing 28 grams or more of heroin, and 45 years in prison on the verdict of guilty of transporting 28 grams or more of heroin.  The court also imposed a $ 500,000 fine in each of the above trafficking cases.  Prayer for judgment was continued, without condition, in both of the conspiracy cases.  We allowed bypass of the Court of Appeals in these cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tended to show that at about 11:20 a.m. on 9 June 1982, Detectives J. H. Johnson and E. T. Bert, of the Raleigh Police Department, Drug and Vice Division, observed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Edell Willis (hereinafter Willis) park a yellow Cadillac in the parking lot of the Woodland Apartment complex and enter Apartment 823-C carrying a small brown paper bag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At about 1:30 p.m. on the same day Willis was seen by Detectives Johnson, Bert, and Weatherspoon leaving Apartment 823-C Suffolk Boulevard with nothing in his hands.  He entered the Cadillac, drove out of the parking lot, and turned right onto Suffolk Boulevard.  After traveling a short distance, Willis was stopped by Detectives O'Shields and O. T. Perry.  About ten minutes after Willis left Apartment 823-C, defendant was seen leaving the same apartment wearing a dark hat and carrying a silver, shiny package which appeared to be six to eight inches long and three to four inches wide.  Defendant left the parking lot in a gold and white pickup truck and turned right onto Suffolk Boulevard.  His truck came to an abrupt halt between the apartment complex and where Willis's vehicle had been stopped by the police officers.  He then backed down Suffolk Boulevard, stopped and abruptly turned left into a driveway between dwellings 810 and 812 on Suffolk Boulevard.  Defendant was out of sight of the police officers for just&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a few seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sergeant Perry pursued defendant as he backed down Suffolk Boulevard and observed him behind 810 Suffolk Boulevard closing the driver's door of the truck with his elbow.  Sergeant Perry then saw defendant back his truck straight across the driveway and into the back of the residence of 812 Suffolk Boulevard where the officer blocked defendant's vehicle with his police car.  Defendant asked Sergeant Perry to retrieve his hat for him indicating that it was on the ground behind 810 Suffolk Boulevard.  Defendant then told Sergeant Perry that he wanted to talk to &quot;Shield.&quot; When Sergeant Perry responded that Detective O'Shields was not at the scene, defendant indicated that Detective O'Shields was in fact approaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he arrived, Detective O'Shields advised defendant of his rights and asked him if he wanted to talk.  Defendant replied, &quot;I don't want to take the fall for all of somebody else's s---.&quot; O'Shields then said, &quot;Are you talking about Edell?&quot; Defendant asked O'Shields, &quot;What will I get out of this if I talk to you?&quot; O'Shields then told defendant that he would give the district attorney any information that he released to him, but that he could not guarantee&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  him anything.  Defendant said that he understood, but added, &quot;I just don't want to take the fall for everybody else's mess.&quot; Defendant was asked, &quot;What did you do with the package you carried out of the apartment?&quot; Defendant replied, &quot;How will you help me if I tell you that?&quot; Before O'Shields answered, a detective located the package some yards away from the truck in some bushes.  O'Shields then told defendant that they had found it, and asked, &quot;Do you have anything else you want to say?&quot; Defendant said, &quot;No, but are they going into the apartment?&quot; O'Shields replied, &quot;They are going to obtain a search warrant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant told Detective O'Shields that Apartment 823-C belonged to his girlfriend, that he had a key to it, and that Willis had left an ounce or so under the bed in the apartment.  He asked the detective not to tear up the apartment.  Defendant said that he had nothing to do with the drugs and that his girlfriend was not involved.  He further stated that Willis wanted to use the place.  Detective O'Shields asked defendant if, other than the package he brought out of the apartment and the package he stated was under the bed, that was all he (defendant) knew about being in the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  apartment.  Defendant answered that it was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further evidence for the State tended to show that Detective Weatherspoon, while searching behind 810 Suffolk Boulevard, found a shiny, foil-wrapped package in the bushes, free of dirt, moisture and debris.  Detectives Johnson, Bert, and Weatherspoon were of the opinion that the foil-wrapped package in the honeysuckle bushes was the same package they had observed in the left hand of defendant when he left Apartment 823-C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the package was opened, the detectives found 390 glassine envelopes, each envelope or bindle containing a small amount of white powder which was uniform in color, texture, and appearance.  J. F. Casale, an expert in the area of forensic chemistry, analyzed a sample of the white powder and found it to be a mixture of heroin and mannitol.  The aggregate mixture of all the bindles was 82.9 grams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detectives also found a Carolina Power and Light bill and a Southern Bell bill in defendant's name with the address 823 Suffolk Boulevard on each.  A key was found on defendant's key chain that fit the lock on Apartment 823-C Suffolk Boulevard.  They also found $ 7,440 in his sock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 9 June 1982 detectives obtained a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  warrant to search Apartment 823-C Suffolk Boulevard.  In the bedroom under the bed they found two large green plastic bags containing numerous items which the officers recognized as items used in packaging and repackaging heroin.  They found mannitol, a common agent used in cutting heroin, rubber gloves, boxes with empty bindles or envelopes, a strainer, album covers, aluminum foil, scotch tape, rubber bands, measuring spoons and other items.  They also found a plastic bag containing a white powder which was properly secured and later analyzed by expert witness J. F. Casale who found the white powder to be 26.3 grams of virtually uncut heroin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered evidence tending to show that he sometimes stayed at his girlfriend's apartment on Suffolk Boulevard, that he had known Willis since childhood, and that he had often done work on Willis's car.  On 9 June 1982 Willis was in the neighborhood of Suffolk Boulevard and saw defendant's truck parked in front of the apartment building.  Willis entered the apartment and they visited for a period of time.  Defendant and Willis did nothing in the apartment except drink coffee and talk about general things and in particular about defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  putting a new engine in Willis's El Camino.  Willis left the apartment.  When defendant later left the apartment, he was carrying some bills and an envelope in his hand.  Defendant drove into a driveway across Suffolk Boulevard from the apartment complex to check out an old car he was thinking about buying.  He backed his vehicle near the old car and was there blocked in by the police and arrested.  He was questioned by an officer who identified himself as O'Shields.  He did not know O'Shields prior to this questioning.  O'Shields asked defendant about a package and he responded that he did not know what he was talking about.  He made no other statement to O'Shields, but stated that he saw an officer find a package, which appeared to be wrapped in smooth aluminum foil, in the woods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being taken to jail, he was at some time placed in the same area with Willis, and he asked Willis about the package that the police found in the woods.  Willis then told defendant that he had hidden the package in the woods across Suffolk Boulevard from the apartments the night before and was in the neighborhood to get it on 9 June when he saw defendant's truck and decided to stop by the apartment. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Willis said that when he left the apartment he intended to drive around the block once or twice to see if the coast was clear but that he was stopped by the police before he had gotten very far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was in jail when the apartment was searched, and he testified that he knew nothing about any of the items that police had testified were seized in the apartment.  Defendant and his girlfriend, Linda Fay Watson, each had keys to and access to the apartment.  He further testified that he had never conspired with Willis or had anything to do with controlled substances.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order from the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina), which imposed a life sentence and a fine and found defendant guilty of violating N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-27(a) for trafficking in heroin by possessing 28 grams or more of heroin. Defendant was also convicted of conspiracy to possess heroin, conspiracy to manufacture heroin, trafficking in heroin by transporting heroin, and trafficking in heroin by manufacturing heroin.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal of the possession and transportation of heroin convictions, the court held that the evidence of defendant's control of the apartment where heroin and implements of manufacturing were found, in addition to evidence of the transportation of heroin, was ample evidence of actual and constructive possession to support an inference that defendant had the power to control the drugs and that he transported heroin. There was ample evidence to give rise to a reasonable inference that defendant manufactured the heroin by packaging it. The testimony of the expert chemist, in addition to the evidence of possession, manufacturing, and transporting, was more than ample to have supported a reasonable inference of trafficking. The court rejected defendant's constitutional challenges to the penalties imposed for the trafficking offenses. The court rejected defendant's contention that the trafficking offense amounted to double jeopardy with the other drug charges because the other offenses were distinct, and the amount was the determining factor in a trafficking charge. The court affirmed the circuit court's increase of defendant's bond during trial and his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's heroin convictions, sentence, and the fine imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant as a matter of right pursuant to N.C.G.S. &sect; 7A-27(a) from the judgments entered by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hobgood, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 6 February 1984 Criminal Session of Alamance County Superior Court.  Judgments entered 16 February 1984.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was convicted of first degree rape, first degree sexual offense and first degree kidnapping.  Following the sentencing hearing Judge Hobgood sentenced defendant to terms of life imprisonment for first degree rape and first degree sexual offense, the sentences to run concurrently, and to a thirty-year term of imprisonment for first degree kidnapping, that sentence to run consecutively with the life sentences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tended to show that defendant approached Elizabeth Boyd, the seven year old victim, while she was playing near her home.  Defendant convinced her to accompany him to a nearby wooded area where he inserted his finger in her vagina.  Subsequent to this act he raped her.  Semen, consistent with defendant's blood type, was found on the victim's underwear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elizabeth told her mother, Ellen Boyd, that her assailant was a white male who was wearing a dark blue baseball cap and T-shirt, each with white lettering, a pair of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  blue jeans and a pair of blue and white Nike tennis shoes.  She also recalled that he was carrying a radio-tape player.  Wilson Boyd, Elizabeth's father, had seen defendant walking on the road in front of his house prior to the assault.  Steve Johnson, who lived near the Boyd residence, saw an individual matching Elizabeth's description of her assailant cut through his yard shortly after the assault had taken place.  At trial in defendant's presence Johnson stated that he did not see that individual in the courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Elizabeth recounted what had happened to her Mrs. Boyd called the Sheriff's Department, told them her daughter had been raped, and described the assailant.  Shortly after the Sheriff's Department received this description of the assailant, defendant, who matched the description, was spotted by Lieutenant Perkins along Highway 87 and stopped.  Lieutenant Perkins asked that defendant accompany him to the Boyd residence to clear up a certain matter and defendant agreed.  Upon their arrival Elizabeth was brought outside and identified defendant as her assailant.  He was then arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant took the stand in his own behalf and gave alibi testimony which was corroborated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by several witnesses.  He denied any knowledge of the assault on Elizabeth.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Alamance County Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted him of first degree rape, first degree sexual offense, and first degree kidnapping. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for first degree rape and first degree sexual offense, the sentences to run concurrently, and to a 30-year term of imprisonment for first degree kidnapping, that sentence to run consecutively with the life sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In defendant's appeal from his convictions, the court found no prejudicial error in the trial court's admission of opinion and character evidence by the seven-year-old victim's mother offered to bolster the victim's credibility. The trial court erred in allowing the mother to testify that the victim had a good character for truthfulness and could distinguish fantasy from reality, but the error was harmless. The trial court correctly refused to declare a mistrial after a detective testified that defendant asserted his right of silence following his arrest because the prosecutor was not attempting to capitalize on defendant's silence and a curative instruction was given. In revising N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-39(b) to make the commission of a sexual assault on the victim an element of the offense of first degree kidnapping, the legislature did not intend defendants to be punished separately for both first degree kidnapping and the underlying sexual assault. Defendant's convictions therefore placed him in double jeopardy. The case was remanded for resentencing, and the trial court was directed to arrest judgment on either the kidnapping or one of the sexual assault convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded the case for resentencing. It directed the trial court either to arrest judgment on the first degree kidnapping conviction and resentence defendant for second degree kidnapping or to arrest judgment on the first degree rape or first degree sexual assault conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court added that the cross-examination did not violate defendant's constitutional rights and that, where punishment was involved, the double jeopardy clause acted as a restraint on the prosecutor and the courts, and only prohibited a trial court from imposing more punishment than was intended by the legislature. The court concluded that defendant was properly tried, convicted of, and punished separately for the crime of breaking or entering and the crime of felony larceny following a breaking or entering when those cases were jointly tried.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff arrested drivers (drivers) had their drivers' licenses revoked pursuant to the Safe Roads Act of 1983, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 20 et seq. The drivers filed separate complaints that alleged that the orders that revoked the licenses were unconstitutional. The Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina) consolidated the two actions and concluded that the pretrial revocation provision deprived the drivers of an interest in their property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court entered an order that enjoined the state from revoking the drivers' licenses. The court employed the three factor balancing test to resolve the due process issue. First, the court weighed the private interest that was affected and determined that the interest in the drivers' licenses was not insubstantial. The court then balanced the risk of erroneous deprivation of the private interest and the probable value of additional procedural safeguards. The court determined that the procedures provided a reasonably reliable basis for determining that the facts that justified the revocation were as alleged. Finally, the court weighed the state's interest and the fiscal and administrative burdens that would have resulted from additional procedures. The court held that the state's interest in highway safety outweighed the private interest involved and any risk of erroneously depriving those interests. The court determined that the 10-day revocation period was not punishment, but was instead a highway safety measure that gave the drivers all the process they were due and did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the extension of the revocation period of one driver and affirmed the remainder of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of murder and armed robbery and sentenced to death. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held that the failure to conduct a formal arraignment did not render the verdict or judgment invalid. There was probable cause for defendant's arrest. &quot;Death-qualifying&quot; the jury did not result in a biased jury. While N.C. Gen.

The appellate court held that the term &quot;clear proceeds&quot; as used in N.C. Const. art. IX, &sect; 7 was synonymous with net proceeds and that collection costs should be deducted from the gross proceeds of monies received for traffic violations. On review, the court held that reasonable collection costs could constitutionally be deducted from the gross proceeds of overtime parking fines the city collected, asserting that the proper test to determine permissible deductions must bear a reasonable relation to the fine's collection cost. The court concluded that collection costs did not include those associated with enforcing the ordinance but were limited to administrative costs. The court opined that if the costs of enforcing the state's penal laws were part of collecting fines imposed by the laws, there could never be any clear proceeds of such fines to be used to support public schools, thereby contravening the constitution or being impractical.

App. 198, 309 S.E. 2d 473 (1983), affirming the order of the North Carolina Utilities Commission entered 2 September 1981, Docket No. E-13, Sub 29 (Remanded) reducing retail electric utility rates and requiring a refund by respondents Nantahala Power and Light Company (&quot;Nantahala&quot;) and its parent corporation, Aluminum Company of America (&quot;Alcoa&quot;) to Nantahala's retail ratepayers for the four-year period of 1977-1981.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent power company applied to the North Carolina Utilities Commission (Commission) for a rate increase, which was approved, and which was later reversed by the Court of Appeals (North Carolina). On remand, the Commission reduced retail electric utility rates and required a refund from the power company and its parent corporation to the retail ratepayers for the four-year period. The power company and its parent corporation sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The power company and its parent corporation argued that the order was precluded by exclusive federal licensing of interstate hydroelectric power facilities, that it intruded upon the authority vested in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and that it imposed an impermissible burden on interstate commerce. The court affirmed the order. The Commission's order in no way contravened the terms of the parent corporation's federal license to operate hydroelectric plants and the Commission was not preempted from implementing the roll-in methodology for setting the retail rates by the Supremacy Clause or the FERC's exclusive jurisdiction over certain interstate wholesale power transactions and agreements. Utilization of the roll-in did not grant a preference to the power company's North Carolina customers. Application of the roll-in methodology, with its resulting reduction in retail rates and refund obligation, did not impermissibly impair the power company's ability to earn a proper rate of return on its investment. The Commission acted within its regulatory and rate making authority in imposing the obligation upon the parent corporation to pay any portion of the refund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision upholding the Commission's order reducing the power company's retail rates and requiring refunds from the power company and its parent corporation to the North Carolina retail customers.</SPAN></P>

As to the dispositive issue, the court concluded that the statute was constitutional. The court found unpersuasive the administratrix's argument that the statute violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and N.C. Const. art.

The court found that the statute did not distinguish between manufacturers and retail sellers of products who were protected from liability beyond the six-year period of repose. The court further held that the statute did not violate the &quot;open courts&quot; provision of N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 18.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court granted a declaratory judgment for the father, ruling that home instruction was not prohibited by statutes on compulsory school attendance and, if it were, then the statutes contravened freedoms guaranteed to the father by the state and federal constitutions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant county department of social services sought review of a decision of the court of appeals (North Carolina), which affirmed in part and reversed in part a judgment of the Mecklenburg County Superior Court. The county sought sterilization of appellee, a mentally retarded woman, on the grounds that the woman would probably not be able to care for children and that sterilization would be in her best interests and those of the public good.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county department of social services petitioned for an order authorizing the sterilization of the mentally retarded woman. The county claimed that the requirements of N.C. Gen.

The lower court denied the petition because the county did not show by clear, strong, and convincing evidence that the woman was likely to engage in sexual activity. The county sought a de novo hearing on appeal, and the court of appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court. The county sought further review. On review, the court found that the lower court did not err in its construction of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 35-43 or in the further requirements of proof that it imposed upon the county.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision of the lower court denying the order authorizing sterilization sought by the county.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Downs, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 16 January 1984 Criminal Session of Superior Court, Mecklenburg County.  Defendant was convicted of first-degree rape and sentenced to life imprisonment.  He appeals as a matter of right pursuant to N.C.G.S. &sect; 7A-27(a) (1981).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence at trial tended to show that the prosecuting witness, Mary Black, spent the evening of 23 April 1983 with her boyfriend in her apartment.  She had sexual intercourse with her boyfriend in the apartment prior to 10:00 p.m. when he left for work.  As a result of taking pain medication, Ms. Black fell asleep on a sofa in her apartment soon after her boyfriend left.  She was awakened by a knock on her front door.  She went to answer the door and recognized defendant James Walter Peek standing outside.  Ms. Black had known defendant since 1981 when he worked on an interior construction project in the office where she was employed.  She and defendant had gone to lunch together a number of times and defendant had visited Ms. Black in her apartment on several occasions.  On one such occasion defendant had made sexual advances toward her.  Ms. Black testified that she protested and struggled with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  him, but that she finally submitted, and had sexual intercourse with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night of 23 April 1983 after Ms. Black admitted defendant to her apartment, he returned to his car to turn off the car's motor and to retrieve his gun, telling Ms. Black he did not want his gun to be stolen.  Defendant reentered the apartment, closed and locked Ms. Black's front door and sat down with her on the sofa.  Defendant's gun was in his pocket at that time, but Ms. Black testified that she was not initially frightened by it.  Defendant began making sexual advances toward Ms. Black, and she asked him to leave.  Assuring her that he would not hurt her, defendant removed a bullet from his gun and gave it to her.  Ms. Black and defendant began to struggle on the sofa, and she scratched defendant.  When defendant looked in a mirror above the sofa to see the scratch, he told Ms. Black the scratch burned and that he was going to hurt her.  At that time defendant had the gun in his hand, and Ms. Black testified that she was afraid of it.  Ms. Black threatened to call the police, but defendant told her he would have done what he wanted to do by the time the police arrived.  After another struggle Ms. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Black submitted against her will to vaginal intercourse with defendant.  Defendant also attempted to have anal intercourse with her.  Ms. Black testified that during the sexual acts, she thought the gun was on the sofa beside her head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Black called the police after defendant left her apartment.  She was taken to a hospital where a rape kit was prepared.  The results of the rape kit revealed that semen was present in both vaginal and rectal smears taken from Ms. Black.  Both Ms. Black and her boyfriend denied having engaged in anal intercourse on the evening of 23 April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's evidence tended to show that he and Ms. Black engaged in consensual sexual intercourse on the night in question.  Defendant testified that Ms. Black neither scratched him nor threatened to call the police.  He stated that although he had a gun on his person when he first went to Ms. Black's door, he returned the gun to his car when he turned off the car's motor.  Defendant also testified that he and Ms. Black had been lovers for a time and that he had proposed to marry her.  He testified that while he worked in the building where Ms. Black was employed, they had lunch together nearly every day and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that he had introduced her to his co-workers as his &quot;lady.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of defendant's former co-workers testified that he had frequently seen defendant and Ms. Black go to lunch together and that he had observed them holding hands.  Another co-worker testified that Ms. Black and defendant appeared to be &quot;going with each other,&quot; and that defendant had mentioned spending the night with Ms. Black.  Several witnesses stated their opinions about defendant's character.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found defendant guilty of first-degree rape.  Although the trial judge eventually sentenced defendant to the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment, he postponed sentencing defendant for one month to investigate alternatives to sentencing.  He also conducted a sentencing hearing during which he found five factors in mitigation and none in aggravation cognizable under the Fair Sentencing Act.  N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1340.1-1340.7 (1983).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court prejudicially erred when giving jury instructions after its foreman said that the jury was having trouble reaching a unanimous verdict and in not informing the jury that character evidence could be considered as substantive evidence and as evidence relating to credibility. Defendant argued that a life sentence for rape was constitutionally disproportionate and cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that: (1) because the trial court merely asked the jury to continue to deliberate without an element of coercion, there was no violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1235; (2) defendant's character evidence did not rise to the level of competent evidence because it did not relate to defendant's general reputation, only how each witness perceived defendant; (3) a trial court is not required to instruct on character evidence even where such evidence was competent; and (4) in view of the seriousness of the offense and the court's obligation to grant substantial deference to the legislature's authority to determine the types and limits of punishments, defendant's sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive, gross, or disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Martin, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 3 October 1983 Criminal Session of Superior Court, Wayne County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grand jury of Wayne County returned a bill of indictment charging defendant, a practicing attorney in Wayne County, with twenty-nine separate counts in the nature of embezzlement or false pretense.  The trial court, however, submitted only three counts to the jury: count XVII: Embezzlement of $ 14,500 on or about 13 April 1982 of monies of a client, Carolyn Stallings (individually and as guardian ad litem for John J. Stallings, incompetent) [a violation of G.S. 14-90]; count XXII: Obtaining $ 21,000 from Mrs. Estelle Sutton on or about 29 April 1982 by means of a false pretense [a violation of G.S. 14-100]; count XXV: Malfeasance as a corporate officer by the embezzlement of $ 6,000 on 27 April 1982 of monies belonging to Kornegay, Rice and Edwards, P.A. [a violation of G.S. 14-254].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State offered evidence tending to show that in 1979 Mrs. Estelle Sutton was involved in an automobile accident in Sampson County in which she was seriously injured.  Mr. Seals, the occupant of the other car involved in the accident, died as a result of injuries received in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the collision.  While she was still in the hospital, Mrs. Sutton, a 72-year-old widow, sent for Mr. Kornegay to talk to him about representing her in the criminal matters pending against her in which she was charged with the death by motor vehicle and failure to yield the right of way.  After consulting with Mrs. Sutton defendant Kornegay advised her that he would charge her $ 3,500 for this appearance in criminal court and at that time obtained an authorization from her to investigate her financial condition.  After making this investigation, he thereafter told Mrs. Sutton that his fee would be $ 5,500.  Mrs. Sutton attended the trial on the day that she was discharged from the hospital.  The court dismissed the charge of death by motor vehicle and a satisfactory plea bargain on the charge of failure to yield the right of way was arranged.  On the day of the trial Mrs. Sutton paid defendant his fee of $ 5,500.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During their trip home, Mr. Kornegay advised her that she would probably be sued in a civil action.  Several months later she received the summons and complaint in the civil action and carried them to Mr. Kornegay's office.  At trial her insurance company, which had a liability&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of only $ 25,000, retained Mr. I. Edward Johnson of Raleigh, North Carolina.  Defendant Kornegay was retained by Mrs. Sutton to represent her for liability in excess of coverage.  Mrs. Sutton did not attend the civil trial because of illness and was advised by defendant Kornegay that the jury had returned a verdict against her in excess of $ 200,000 and that he had given notice of appeal.  At that point, Mrs. Sutton paid Mr. Kornegay $ 10,000 for his representation in the civil action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After some months, Mr. Kornegay obtained a settlement in the matter and he told Mrs. Sutton that the agreement was &quot;to pay the Seals' estate $ 125,000.&quot; He then instructed her to bring him two checks: one in the amount of $ 125,000 in settlement of the Seals suit and the other in the amount of $ 6,000 to finish paying his legal fee.  On 27 April 1982 Mrs. Sutton delivered the checks to a secretary in Mr. Kornegay's office.  Several weeks later she called Mr. Kornegay and asked for something to show that the case was settled.  She received a letter dated 1 June 1982 from Mr. Kornegay which in part read: &quot;Pursuant to our telephone conversation, I am writing you this letter to tell you that your case has&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  been settled.  As you know, we paid $ 125,000 to them in full settlement of this matter.  As I told you, the judgment against you was recorded in four counties which includes Wayne, Duplin, Johnston and Sampson.  It will take some time to get this settled.  You do not have anything to worry about.&quot; At her request, Mr. Kornegay wrote her a letter in which he stated: &quot;This is to advise you that you have paid my fees in full concerning the wreck.&quot; There was no specification as to the exact amount of the legal fees nor as to how these fees were determined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October 1982 Mrs. Sutton was contacted by the S.B.I. and at that time she learned that defendant Kornegay had retained $ 21,000 from the $ 125,000 check which she had delivered to him for settlement of the judgments against her in favor of the Seals estate.  She testified that she had never authorized defendant Kornegay to take any money out of the $ 125,000 check for himself or his law firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 1982 the law firm of Kornegay, Rice and Edwards, P.A. opened an office in Kenansville, North Carolina where Mrs. Diane Grubbs was employed as secretary, bookkeeper and receptionist.  That office kept two bank accounts in the Bank&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of North Carolina, N.A., Kenansville.  One account was a firm trust account and the other was the firm's operating account.  The first money received by Mrs. Grubbs was a $ 5,000 check from State Farm Insurance Company payable to Carolyn Stallings, and she thereafter received a $ 25,000 check payable to Carolyn Stallings.  Mrs. Stallings endorsed both checks and Mrs. Grubbs deposited them in the firm's trust account in Kenansville.  On 8 March 1982, upon Mr. Kornegay's instructions, she wrote checks on the firm's trust account as follows: Carolyn T. Stallings -- $ 3,000.00; T. LaFontine Odom -- expenses $ 469.48; Bernard I. Scherer -- attorney's fee $ 3,000.00; T. LaFontine Odom -- attorney's fee $ 4,200.00 and George R. Kornegay -- attorney's fee $ 3,000.00.  Messrs. Odom and Scherer were attorneys of Charlotte, North Carolina who had associated defendant Kornegay in the trial and settlement of claims which grew out of a personal injury Mrs. Stallings' husband had suffered when struck by an automobile operated by Bruce Blanton, Jr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several months later Mrs. Grubbs noted that Mr. Kornegay had written a check in the amount of $ 14,525 to one Ray Amon from the trust account which then&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  contained only money belonging to Carolyn Stallings.  In October 1982 police officers came to the office and obtained records from Mrs. Grubbs, including the trust account cards.  Several weeks thereafter defendant Kornegay gave her cash to put in the trust account and she thereafter prepared a check in the amount of $ 16,280.25 payable to Attorney Odom of Charlotte, North Carolina.  There was also evidence that at about this time defendant had borrowed $ 50,000 from Mr. E. J. Pope, Jr. who received as security stock in the Mount Olive Nursing Home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State also presented testimony through Mr. Joseph Marion, an attorney who represented the Seals estate.  He testified that on 5 May 1982 he received a check dated 28 April 1982 from defendant Kornegay in the amount of $ 104,000 in full settlement of the claim against Mrs. Sutton.  This settlement had been reached &quot;about the last week or ten days of April 1982.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ray Amon testified that he is a used car dealer in Mount Olive and that he sold certain property to Mr. Kornegay for $ 100,000.  Amon stated that he received a down payment in the amount of $ 16,000 which was written on the trust account of the firm of Kornegay, Rice and Edwards, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  P.A. Mr. Kornegay paid him the second installment of $ 14,000 by another check drawn on the firm's trust account.  He testified that he knew nothing about Carolyn Stallings or her case and that he received no further payment from defendant Kornegay on the note.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Elnora Whetsell, who was a secretary in the Mount Olive office of the firm of Kornegay, Rice and Edwards, P.A., testified that she noticed some unusual transactions in the office and in 1981 began copying records and taking them home.  She told no one but her husband what she was doing.  She stated that &quot;the reason I took those copies home with me was because he [Kornegay] had been very dishonest and when something dishonest happened then I said well what kind of position can I eventually get in and I took the copies home strictly to protect myself.&quot; In 1982, after conferring with Judge Michael Bruce, Attorney Edwards and Attorney Rice, she did copy additional papers but did so without the knowledge of any of these people or of defendant Kornegay.  After a search warrant was issued in October, she left the law firm.  She testified that defendant Kornegay deposited $ 6,000 belonging to the firm into his personal bank&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  account.  She also corroborated the testimony of the witness Amon to the effect that Kornegay wrote checks on the trust fund to Amon, and at that time there was no money in the trust fund which belonged to Mr. Amon.  Checks to Amon were down payments and subsequent payments on a debt against the Ramblewood Corporation in which defendant Kornegay owned stock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State offered other evidence from Attorney Rice in the nature of corroboration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered no evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned verdicts of guilty as charged on all three counts.  The trial judge pronounced judgment as follows: count XVII -- Embezzlement, the court sentenced defendant to imprisonment for eighteen months and recommended work release privileges; count XXII -- False Pretense, the court imposed a sentence of imprisonment for a term of thirty months and recommended work release upon condition that defendant make restitution to Estelle Sutton in the amount of $ 21,000; count XXV -- malfeasance by a corporate officer, defendant was sentenced to thirty months imprisonment to begin at the expiration of the sentences imposed in count XVII and XXII.  The execution of this sentence was suspended and the defendant was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  placed on supervised probation for a period of three years.  The trial judge also disbarred defendant from the practice of law and profession as an attorney in the State of North Carolina.  Defendant appealed to the North Carolina Court of Appeals and we certified the case for discretionary review </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ex mero motu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> prior to a determination by the Court of Appeals pursuant to N.C.G.S. &sect; 7A-31(a) and Rule 15(e)(2).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty of embezzlement, obtaining money from a client by means of false pretense, and malfeasance as a corporate officer by embezzlement. On appeal, the court held that the defendant received a fair trial free of prejudicial error. The copied records used against Defendant were not obtained by an unreasonable search and seizure conducted by the State or its agents. The person who copied the records acted entirely on her own and for the purpose of protecting herself. There was sufficient evidence in the search warrant affidavit to show probable cause to believe that defendant had committed the charged offenses because over a period of years, defendant's law partners and others noticed numerous instances of defendant's improper handling of trust accounts of clients and funds of the professional association. Two separate and distinct offenses were charged in each case and the trial court did not err in waiting until the close of all evidence to require the State to make an election between the offenses of embezzlement and malfeasance of a corporate agent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 26 July 1983 defendant was charged with having committed a first-degree sexual offense upon Cassandra Harsen, a four-year-old child.  Defendant entered a plea of not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State presented evidence through the testimony of Cassandra Harsen and her mother, Jenny Morrell, which tended to show that Cassandra was four years old at the time of the assault and that she lived with her mother in Jacksonville.  In May 1983 Cassandra was left in the care of defendant and his wife, Nina Higginbottom, while Ms. Morrell went on a week's vacation.  The two families were well acquainted and had exchanged babysitting services in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cassandra's testimony tended to show that one night while she was staying with the Higginbottoms, Nina Higginbottom fixed popcorn for the children and put them to bed.  Cassandra and the Higginbottoms' three-year-old son, Kenny, shared a bed in Kenny's bedroom.  Cassandra went to sleep and was awakened by defendant who entered the bedroom and laid on the bed.  Defendant then made the child suck on his penis.  Afterwards he asked her&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  if it felt good and if it tasted good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Morrell testified that when she returned from the mountains the following week, Cassandra told her that defendant made her put his &quot;wee-wee&quot; in her mouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's evidence tended to show that on the night in question, defendant, his wife, children, and Cassandra visited a next-door neighbor to celebrate the neighbor's birthday.  Mrs. Higginbottom left the birthday party to take the children home and to fix popcorn.  Defendant left the party between 10:30 and 11:30 p.m. and returned home.  After the children were put in bed, both defendant and Mrs. Higginbottom checked on the children.  Mrs. Higginbottom testified that her husband had to go into the children's bedroom to quiet them but that she was nearby while he was in the bedroom.  Defendant and his wife returned to the living room where they watched television until late that night.  Defendant fell asleep in the den on a love seat and slept there all night.  Mrs. Higginbottom slept on a couch in the den.  Other evidence presented by defendant tended to suggest that Cassandra told the story about defendant because she was angry at him for not permitting her to spend the night with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  some of defendant's friends.  A number of witnesses testified that Cassandra behaved normally after the night in question and that defendant had a good reputation in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict of guilty of first-degree sexual offense.  The trial court sentenced defendant to life imprisonment from which he appealed pursuant to N.C.G.S. 7A-27(a).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with committing a first-degree sexual offense upon a four-year-old child. The jury returned a verdict of guilty and defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment. On review, the court affirmed, finding that defendant received a fair trial free of prejudicial error. The imposition of a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for first-degree sexual offense was not so disproportionate as to constitute a violation of the Eighth Amendment. Also, the trial judge did not impermissibly express an opinion in his instructions to the jury as to the credibility of defendant's witnesses. Further, there was no age below which one was considered incompetent to testify as a matter of law and the trial judge acted within his discretion in allowing the victim to testify. Finally, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying defendant's post-trial motion for appropriate relief, finding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the district attorney to examine the victim with leading questions considering the delicate nature of the sexual matters involved and properly admitted certain corroborative testimony from the victim's mother.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff injured employee appealed the decision of the COURT OF APPEALS OF NORTH CAROLINA, which affirmed the trial court's ruling that an injured worker who collected benefits under the Workers' Compensation Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 97-9, 97-10.1, could not also bring action against a co-worker who caused plaintiff's injuries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff injured employee brought action against defendant co-worker for negligence following an injury he received while at work. In his complaint, plaintiff alleged that his injury occurred because defendant was willfully, recklessly and wantonly negligent. Defendant claimed that such allegations were insufficient to allege an intentional tort which would support plaintiff's action. The trial court found that plaintiff could not recover damages for personal injuries and receive workers' compensation benefits. On appeal, the court disagreed, holding that the concept of willful, reckless and wanton negligence inhabited a twilight zone existing somewhere between ordinary negligence and intentional injury. The court held that Workers' Compensation Act (Act), N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 97-9, 97-10.1, did not shield a co-employee from liability for injury caused by his willful, wanton and reckless negligence. The fact that plaintiff received benefits under the Act did not foreclose him from bringing an action for defendant's willful and wanton negligence. An injured worker in such situations could receive benefits under the Act and also maintain a common law action against the co-employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the appellate court affirming the trial court's holding that plaintiff injured employee could not pursue a negligence action against a co-worker who caused his injuries on the job was reversed. Nothing in the Workers' Compensation Act precluded plaintiff from pursuing both avenues of recovery. This case was remanded to the court of appeals for further remand to the superior court.</SPAN></P>

The patient did not become aware that the physician might have performed unnecessary surgery upon her until more than two years later and that she was not required, as a matter of law to expedite her discovery of the physician's negligence by seeking a second opinion before or after surgery. Therefore, the court held that her injury was not readily apparent and came within the one-year discovery provision of &sect; 1-15. The court found that the patient had timely filed her complaint within one year after discovering the physician's wrongful conduct or negligence, and that her claim should not have been dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from the judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Davis, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 2 May 1983 Special Session of Criminal Superior Court, Watauga County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 8 February 1983 defendant, Dwight Jackson and David Presnell met at the Big G Game Room, a recreation center and pool hall in Boone, North Carolina.  At approximately 6:30 p.m. that day Jackson and Presnell hitchhiked from Boone to Blowing Rock to buy liquor.  They hitchhiked back to the Big G Game Room, arriving at around 7:30 p.m. Presnell and Jackson stayed in the parking lot of the game room drinking the liquor they had purchased.  At some point in the evening defendant, who had been shooting pool inside, left the pool hall and joined Presnell and Jackson in the parking lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A witness testified that the victim, J. O. Cooke, who regularly visited the Big G Game Room, was there that evening.  The witness testified that Cooke left the game room between 9:30 and 10:00 p.m. as was his custom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After finishing a bottle of vodka in the parking lot, defendant, Presnell, and Jackson began to talk about how they might obtain more liquor.  Jackson suggested that they go to J. O. Cooke's house to get another pint.  Since the men had no money, defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  suggested that the three men go to Cooke's house, rob and kill him, and take money.  Presnell and Jackson testified that they thought defendant was joking since robbing Cooke was a common joke at the Big G Game Room.  The three men left the Big G Game Room parking lot and began walking to Cooke's house.  On the way defendant suggested that Jackson hold Cooke, defendant stab him, and Presnell &quot;finish&quot; him.  When the men arrived at Cooke's house, Jackson knocked on the door and told Cooke that they wanted to buy liquor.  Cooke let the men inside and went into the kitchen to get the liquor.  When he returned with the vodka, defendant suddenly reached into his pants, pulled out a knife and stabbed Cooke twice in the chest.  Cooke said &quot;What are you doing?&quot; and fell to the floor.  Cooke was able to take the knife from his own chest, at which point defendant told Presnell to &quot;finish him.&quot; Presnell stabbed the victim five or six times in the back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant searched through Cooke's pockets and wallet and divided the money he found among the three men.  The men then searched the house for other valuables and found a coin collection which they divided.  They left the house, and Jackson placed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the knife in a nearby snowbank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the following day Elvin Hundley and his father, who owned the Big G Game Room, became suspicious when Cooke did not make an appearance at the game room.  Elvin Hundley testified that he and a man named J. C. Trivette went to Cooke's house to look for him at around 4:00 or 4:30 p.m. When Hundley and Trivette arrived, they noticed Cooke's car in his garage.  They knocked on the door at Cooke's house, but they heard no response.  Upon looking into a window, they saw Cooke's body on the floor and immediately notified the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Evan H. Ashby, a medical examiner for Watauga County, testified that in his opinion Cooke had died before midnight on 8 February.  Cooke received two stab wounds in the chest and six in the back, according to Dr. Ashby's testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Modesto Sharyj, a pathologist at Bowman-Gray School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, testified that he had conducted an autopsy on the body of Cooke.  He testified that in his opinion Cooke died shortly after being stabbed.  In his opinion the cause of death was loss of blood resulting from a stab wound to the heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 14 February 1983 Dwight Jackson led Officer Robert Kennedy of the Boone&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police Department to the snowbank where the murder weapon had been placed.  John Bendure, a forensic chemist with the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, testified that fibers found on the blade of the knife were consistent with fibers from the deceased's clothes.  David Spittle, an S.B.I. serologist, testified that tests he had performed on the knife showed the presence of blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott Worsham, an S.B.I. specialist in hair identification and comparison, testified that a hair found on the deceased's clothing was consistent with a hair removed from the head of defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 8 February 1983 defendant was charged with first-degree murder, first-degree burglary, and robbery with a dangerous weapon.  At trial defendant offered no evidence.  The jury found defendant guilty of first-degree murder, first-degree burglary, and robbery with a dangerous weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the sentencing phase of the trial, conducted pursuant to N.C.G.S. &sect; 15A-2000(a)(1), the trial court submitted three aggravating circumstances: (1) whether the murder was committed while defendant was engaged in a commission of robbery with a dangerous weapon or first-degree burglary; (2) whether the murder was committed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for pecuniary gain; and (3) whether the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel.  The trial court submitted two mitigating circumstances for consideration by the jury: (1) the age (19) of defendant; and (2) any other circumstance deemed to have mitigating value.  The jury found as aggravating circumstances that the murder was committed while in the commission of a robbery or burglary and that it was committed for pecuniary gain.  The jury found evidence of one or more mitigating circumstances, but found them insufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstances.  The jury recommended that defendant be sentenced to death and the trial court entered judgment accordingly.  Defendant appealed as a matter of right pursuant to N.C.G.S. &sect; 7A-27(a).  </SPAN></P>

On appeal, the supreme court determined that the state was not required to list in a bill of particulars the aggravating circumstances it intended to prove because aggravating circumstances did not constitute factual information under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-925(b). The court held that the trial court had not abused its discretion in denying defendant's motion to have the state's witnesses sequestered. The court held that a constructive breaking through fraud or deception was enough to accomplish the requisite element for burglary. The court found that the aggravating circumstance that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel was constitutional on its face. The court held that the facts of the case resembled cases in which the jury recommended life imprisonment rather than the death sentence. The court affirmed the conviction of the trial court, vacated the death sentence, and imposed a sentence of life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the appellate court's decision that &sect; 20-138.1(a)(2) was constitutional, holding that: 1) &sect; 20-138.1(a)(2) was not unconstitutionally vague because clearly set out what conduct was proscribed; 2) it was not a violation of constitutional protections to require that one who went perilously close to an area of proscribed conduct took the risk that he could cross the line; 3) all persons were presumed to know the law and a defendant who drank and then drove took the risk that his blood-alcohol content exceeded the legal maximum; and 4) there was no constitutional right to drink and drive; therefore, the legislature could constitutionally decree that a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more was enough to constitute an offense.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff seeks prejudgment interest on an award of damages for personal injuries which were sustained as the result of an automobile collision involving a vehicle owned and operated by defendants.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment. As long as a legislative classification in a statute concerning matters of economics or social welfare had a reasonable basis and was rationally related to a governmental objective that was permissible under the state and federal constitutions, a court would defer to the wisdom of the legislature. The goals of the prejudgment interest statute were legitimate state purposes. They included compensating a plaintiff for delay in payment, preventing unjust enrichment to a defendant for the use value of the money, and promoting settlement. The court rejected defendants' contention that there was no rational reason why claims against self-insurers should not be subject to prejudgment interest to the same extent as claims covered by liability insurance. There was a fundamental difference between self-insurers and insurance companies. Self-insurers only incidentally settled claims; it was the business of liability carriers. Insurers could have an incentive to delay litigation involving claims they insured. Providing for prejudgment interest on claims covered by liability insurance was thus a rational step to achieve the legitimate state goals.</SPAN></P>

The tortfeasors objected on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional. The trial court allowed the motion for prejudgment interest. The tortfeasors contended that &sect; 24-5 violated N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19, the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of U.S. Const. amend XIV, and the exclusive emolument clause contained in N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 32. The court stated that in a previous court decision it had ruled that &sect; 24-5 offended neither the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution nor N.C.

In addition, the legislature could have reasonably concluded that the distinction between defendants with liability insurance and those without was a valid one and that the public welfare would be best served by such a classification. Therefore, &sect; 24-5 did not create a special emolument or privilege within the meaning of N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 32.</SPAN></P>

We granted the State's petition for discretionary review prior to determination by the Court of Appeals pursuant to N.C.G.S. &sect; 7A-31 on 20 August 1984.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a civil action instituted by the Attorney General on behalf of the State of North Carolina seeking a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of nine (9) provisions of the Safe Roads Act of 1983 (Chapter 435 of the 1983 Session Laws, effective 1 October 1983, as amended by Chapter 1101 of the 1983 Session Laws, Regular Session 1984), and an authoritative declaration as to the proper construction and application of five (5) other provisions of the Act.  The State named as defendants in this action seven (7) district court judges (hereinafter &quot;the judicial defendants&quot;) who had ruled adversely to the State in various driving while impaired (&quot;DWI&quot;) cases, and fifteen (15) individuals in whose district court cases the judicial defendants had made such rulings.  The complaint and amended complaint requested that the superior&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  court &quot;construe and interpret&quot; the Safe Roads Act in the manner requested by the State and &quot;declare&quot; the challenged provisions to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an alternative to the complaint, and in the event that the trial court found no jurisdiction pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, N.C.G.S. &sect; 1-253 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the State requested that the court treat the complaint as a petition for a writ of mandamus or prohibition, requesting that the superior court order the judicial defendants to cease their allegedly erroneous constitutional interpretations of the challenged sections of the Safe Roads Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each of the defendants moved pursuant to Rule 12(b) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure that the complaint be dismissed for want of subject matter jurisdiction and that the petition be denied.  After receiving briefs from the parties and hearing oral arguments, the trial court ruled on the defendants' Rule 12(b) motions.  Without reaching the substantive questions presented, Judge Barnette dismissed the State's complaint as to all defendants on the ground that the superior court was without subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the action pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Act.  Judge Barnette further ruled that the superior court is without authority to issue writs of mandamus or prohibition to judges of the district court, reasoning that such authority rests exclusively with the appellate division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State does not appeal the dismissal of its action as to District Court Judges Elton G. Tucker, David Q. LaBarre, and L. Stanley Brown, nor as to individual defendants Eileen M. Smith, John Timothy Daves and Ernest Bradley Williams.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state filed a motion in Superior Court, Wake County (North Carolina), for a declaratory judgment, pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, N. C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-253 et seq., on the constitutionality and application of the Safe Roads Act of 1983. Defendant judges filed a motion to dismiss. The motion was denied and affirmed on appeal for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state argued that the Safe Roads Act of 1983, (Act), should have been construed as constitutional. The state contended that the judges had construed provisions of the Act in a way that was contrary to its legislative intent; refused to uphold provisions as constitutionally sound; and that uneven enforcement contributed to a backlog of unadjudicated cases. The state alternatively sought a writ of mandamus that directed judges to rule the statute constitutional. The judges argued that the state failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The supreme court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that the state failed to allege facts that satisfied jurisdictional prerequisites and the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the advisory nature of the case. The issues raised concerning the Act in the prosecutions of individual defendants charged with violation of the Act were not real existing controversies that established jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act between the state and the individual defendants. The judges could not be considered as parties to the underlying controversies over which they presided.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confrontation was not violated by permitting an expert, who had not conducted certain blood tests, to testify regarding the results of tests because defendant could cross examine the expert regarding the basis of her conclusions. The court also held that there was evidence of premeditation because of the brutality of the murder and because it was apparent that the victim was beaten after being rendered helpless. In addition, the court held that state could refer to defendant's failure to produce rebuttal evidence. Finally, the court held that, although it was improper to permit the jury to bring photographs into the jury room the error was not prejudicial because defendant did not show that the result of the trial would have been different absent the error.</SPAN></P>

The determination was affirmed on judicial appeal based on the fact that the publication was not a newspaper and the publisher's First Amendment rights were not violated. On further appeal, the decision was affirmed on a different basis. Assuming arguendo that the publication was a newspaper, it did not qualify for the exemption from the sales and use tax at N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-164.13(28) for sales of newspapers by resident newspaper street vendors and by newsboys making house-to-house deliveries. The use tax was a taxing statute that operated evenly against all persons who purchased tangible personal property outside North Carolina for use or consumption in the state. It did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because creating the exemption for newspaper sales door-to-door by newsboys had a rational basis in that these sales would likely be made by minors for whom the monthly tax reporting requirements would be burdensome.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On appeal by defendant as a matter of right from the judgments of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Gaines, Judge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, entered at the 25 October 1982 Criminal Session of Superior Court, Mecklenburg County.  In bills of indictment, proper in form, defendant was charged with first degree murder of Cynthia Jean Milton, with first degree murder of Troy C. Milton, with first degree burglary of the home of Cynthia Milton, with first degree burglary of the home of Troy C. and Mary N. Milton, and with assault with a deadly weapon upon Mary N. Milton with intent to kill, inflicting serious injury.  The jury returned verdicts of guilty on all five charges and recommended the sentence of death in both murder cases.  Judge Gaines ordered the imposition of the death penalty for each murder conviction, and imposed consecutive life sentences for each burglary conviction and a consecutive twenty year sentence for the assault conviction.  On 22 November 1983 we granted the defendant's motion to bypass the Court of Appeals on the assault conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In relevant part, the State's evidence tended to show the following: The defendant John Thomas Noland, Jr. was married to Susan Milton Noland, hereinafter referred to as Susan Milton, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for nine years and nine months prior to their separation on 3 March 1981.  For the last eight years of their marriage the couple resided at 4144 S. Tryon Street in Charlotte, North Carolina, next to Susan's parents, Mary and Troy Milton.  The defendant and Susan had two daughters, Missy and Christy, who were ages nine and six respectively at the time of trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susan Milton testified at trial that she and the defendant were married when she was eighteen years old.  They separated for a short period within the first year of their marriage, and again when their oldest daughter was ten months old.  Throughout their marriage John had difficulty retaining permanent employment for extended periods of time.  The couple's final separation was induced in part by John's striking Susan in March of 1981.  At that time Susan and the children moved into an apartment with Susan's sister, Cynthia Milton, hereinafter referred to as Cindy Milton.  Three weeks later Susan and the children returned to the Tryon Street home after John eventually moved out.  During the ensuing period of separation, John visited Susan and their daughters at least once a week and talked on the telephone with them frequently. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Initially John constantly begged Susan to return to him.  Then, he began to make threats regarding their property.  Finally, in an effort to find peace, Susan moved with the children to California in June 1981.  There they lived with Susan's older sister, Dorothy Milton Gardalcic.  Susan informed John by letter where she and the children were living.  For the next several months there was ongoing telephone contact between Susan and the children, and John.  After approximately four months, Susan and her children moved from her sister's house into a separate home, but did not give John the address or telephone number.  They maintained contact with him through her sister's telephone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every time Susan and John talked on the telephone, he asked her when she was coming back to Charlotte.  She always replied that she did not know.  In November 1981, John began making threats against Susan's family.  He told both Susan and her sister Dorothy that he would kill their father, mother and sister Cindy if Susan didn't return to Charlotte with the children before Christmas.  He said, &quot;I'm going to kill Cindy first because she means more to [Susan] than anything.  I'm going to kill your daddy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and make your momma watch.&quot; John further informed Susan that he would place a &quot;gun between [her] daddy's eyes and blow his head off.&quot; Susan and the children did not return to Charlotte.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, 5 February 1982, John telephoned Susan and gave her another ultimatum.  He told her she had two weeks to come back to Charlotte and that, if she did not, he would kill her family.  The following day John called and told Susan that he was not giving her two weeks or any more time.  He demanded her decision immediately.  When she answered that she did not want to take the children out of school, he responded, &quot;Well, you will come back; you'll have to come back, because I am going to kill your family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About two weeks later on Saturday, 20 February 1982, John called Susan again.  He inquired as to whether she was coming back, to which she replied, &quot;Not now.&quot; He then told Susan, with regard to his plans for her family, &quot;I know how I'm going to do it and when I'm going to do it, but, I'm not going to tell you when.&quot; Prior to this conversation, John had informed Susan that he had a .44 magnum in the trunk of his car, which was waiting for her when she returned.  After the 20 February 1982 telephone&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  conversation with John, Susan called her mother Mary Milton, as she always did after John made threats against her family, to warn her about John's latest threat.  The following day at approximately 7:00 p.m. Charlotte time, Susan telephoned her sister Cindy and warned her to be very careful because of the defendant's latest threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At around 9:00 p.m. on Sunday, 21 February 1982, Cindy Milton and her two friends, Roger Campbell and Jody Renhold, were watching television in the living room of her home at 4144 S. Tryon Street in Charlotte, North Carolina.  This house was the same one that previously had been occupied by Cindy's sister Susan Milton and the defendant.  Upon hearing a knock on the living room window, Cindy went to the back door to investigate.  The next sound Renhold and Campbell heard was a loud bang followed by Cindy's screams as she rushed into the house.  With her hands covering her face, she cried, &quot;Oh God, no,&quot; and ran into the laundry room adjacent to the kitchen.  A man, later identified by Renhold and Campbell as the defendant, John Thomas Noland, Jr., followed Cindy into the house yelling, &quot;I told you not to get involved.&quot; He followed her into the laundry room, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  took aim, and shot Cindy in the back of the head as she huddled helplessly behind the laundry room door.  The defendant turned and entered the living room.  Renhold and Campbell stood facing the defendant for a few seconds before scrambling for cover in other parts of the house.  The assailant departed, leaving the two witnesses unharmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Directly across a vacant lot from Cindy Milton's house, at 418 West Peterson Drive, lived Cindy's parents, Mary and Troy Milton.  At approximately 9:00 p.m. on the day in question, Mary Milton was in her living room writing a letter, while her husband was in the back bedroom asleep.  Mary Milton heard what sounded like a gunshot and walked into the front bedroom to peer out the window in the direction of her daughter Cindy's house.  While Mrs. Milton was still in the bedroom, she turned to find a man whom she recognized and later identified as the defendant, standing in the hallway of her home.  Upon seeing the defendant with a gun in his hand, Mary Milton screamed and slammed her door shut.  She heard a gunshot coming from the room in which her husband was sleeping.  Then, as the defendant pushed her door open, he told Mary Milton, &quot;I told you I&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was going to kill all three of you.  And, I've already killed Cindy and your old man.  I'm going to get you.&quot; The defendant shot at Mrs. Milton.  She picked up a nearby bar stool and lunged at the defendant.  He fired again, this time wounding Mary Milton who fell to the floor, rolled toward the bed and remained very still.  The defendant turned and walked out of the house.  Mrs. Milton immediately telephoned Cindy's house, and discovered from Roger Campbell that Cindy had been shot.  She called the Charlotte City Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlotte law enforcement officers J. L. Hughes and J. P. Albini arrived at the Milton home simultaneously.  Mary Milton met them at the door.  Her bathrobe was shredded and her right front midsection bore extensive gun powder burns.  She informed the officers that her husband and daughter had been shot.  Officer Hughes entered the Milton home and found Troy Milton lying in his bed dead.  The forensic pathologist Dr. Hobart Wood later determined that the cause of Mr. Milton's death was a massive gunshot wound of the head, with entry through the left eye and face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Officer Hughes investigated the Milton home, Officer Albini proceeded to Cindy Milton's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  house located on the corner.  He found Jody Renhold and Roger Campbell standing outside the house, clutching each other and screaming hysterically.  As the officer entered the back door, he noticed that the glass from the top portion of the door had been shattered and lay in pieces on the steps.  Once inside he observed a large amount of blood and tissue on the floor which appeared to be seeping from the laundry room.  Officer Albini looked behind the partially closed laundry room door and discovered Cindy Milton's body, in a kneeling position facing the wall.  Dr. Wood testified that Cindy's death resulted from a massive gunshot wound to the head, with the point of entry in the back right occipital area of the head and measuring six inches in diameter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before being taken to the hospital, Mary Milton informed Officer Hughes that the assailant was her ex-son-in-law John Noland, Jr.  She gave the officer a physical description of the defendant as well as a description of his automobile.  Renhold and Campbell gave a similar physical description and further told Officer Albini that they believed the gunman was Cindy Milton's ex-brother-in-law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within an hour after the shootings, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Charlotte City Police received a call to investigate a suspicious vehicle parked in front of a residence on Beam Road.  As Sergeant J. R. Haston approached the Beam Road residence, he observed a car parked crossways in the driveway.  The car fit the description of defendant's car given by Mary Milton.  The officer stopped his vehicle about 25 yards away from the parked car, drew his revolver and told the driver, who was still sitting in the car, to put his hands out the window.  The driver complied and, in response to Sergeant Haston's request for his name, the driver stated, &quot;John Noland.  You got me man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sergeant handcuffed the defendant, placed him in the back of the police car and read him the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights.  Soon thereafter, Mecklenburg County and Charlotte City law enforcement officers arrived.  The defendant was transported to the Charlotte Law Enforcement Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Patsy Norment, who resided at the Beam Road house in front of which defendant had parked his car, informed the officers that at one time she observed the defendant get out of his car.  Thus, a search of the surrounding area was conducted.  In the grass approximately 12 feet in front of defendant's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  car, the officers discovered a Sturm Ruger 6 shot single action revolver chambered for a .44 magnum cartridge.  A shell casing was found on the front seat of the car.  Two empty shell casings were discovered by Mrs. Norment the following day and were turned over to the police.  A holster and a box of ammunition were eventually discovered in the trunk of the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An examination of the gun by Roger Thompson of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Crime Laboratory revealed that the cylinder contained two live .44 caliber cartridges and one discharged .44 cartridge.  In Mr. Thomas's expert opinion the gun found near the defendant's car was the weapon that fired the projectile removed from the body of Troy Milton.  Mr. Thomas also testified that he examined the clothing worn by Mary Milton at the time she was wounded, and determined that Mrs. Milton's bathrobe exhibited two areas of gunshot damage.  The left side of the robe exhibited characteristics of a firearm being held parallel to the garment with the muzzle in contact with it when it was discharged.  The area of damage on the mid-right abdominal area of the garment exhibited powder and residue characteristics consistent with a firearm held&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at a distance greater than contact but less than 6 inches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Charlotte Law Enforcement Center, the defendant was advised of his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights by Officer C. E. Boothe, a homicide investigator.  Defendant acknowledged that he understood his rights and requested the presence of an attorney during any further questioning by the officers.  Officer Boothe testified that later that night the defendant stated, without any prompting or questioning from the officers, &quot;Man I just killed two people, man.  Why are you being so nice to me?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through various witnesses the defendant offered evidence of his mental and emotional condition at the time prior to and during the shooting incidents.  The defendant's parents testified that the defendant became very depressed and nervous subsequent to his separation from his wife.  He frequently cried or sat inside the house staring vacantly.  Defendant began receiving treatment in April 1981 at the Mecklenburg County Mental Health Center, first as an outpatient.  In May 1981 he was voluntarily hospitalized and treated as an inpatient for about a week.  During that hospitalization, the initial diagnosis was depressive neurosis.  One week after his&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  discharge from the Mental Health Hospital, defendant's father committed him with an involuntary commitment petition.  An attending psychiatrist, Dr. John Humphrey, found the defendant to be mentally ill and made a tentative diagnosis of borderline personality with recurring thoughts of suicide and homicide.  In late May 1981 defendant's condition showed little improvement.  Thus, he was involuntarily committed to the Mecklenburg Mental Health Hospital by Chief Judge Chase Saunders of Mecklenburg County District Court for a period not to exceed 90 days.  On 10 June 1981 the defendant was unconditionally discharged from the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Billy W. Royal, a forensic psychiatrist at Dorothea Dix Hospital in Raleigh, North Carolina, examined the defendant subsequent to his arrest and diagnosed the defendant's condition as a dysthymic disorder, which is also known as depressive neurosis.  Personality tests administered by Dr. Royal revealed evidence of depression, insecurity, anxiety, and low self-esteem.  According to Dr. Royal, the defendant's personality structure and past history created an instability which made it impossible for the defendant to deal with the loss of his wife and children. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With regard to the incidents of 21 February 1982, Dr. Royal noted that the defendant John Noland was in a condition of continued distress, which had recently been heightened by the defendant's conclusion that his hope of reconciliation with his wife and children would not be fulfilled.  He became increasingly disturbed and obsessive.  Dr. Royal learned from the defendant that on the evening of 21 February 1982 the defendant was driving his car and passed by the house that he and his family had shared at 4144 South Tryon Street.  At that time, the defendant's attention riveted on a swing set in the backyard.  According to the defendant, he drove up and down the road in an obsessional trance.  John Noland told Dr. Royal that he went to the door of the house, saw movement in the house and had no recollection of the events after that.  Later, he found himself out in the car.  He felt strange and different, and realized he had a hot gun in his hand.  He became anxious and threw the gun away.  The next thing the defendant remembered was the police talking to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Royal testified, with respect to John Noland's lack of recollection of the killings, that amnesia based upon psychiatric&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or psychological causes can occur when a person experiences a conflict of emotions.  Such conflict involves activities which the normal consciousness views as an unacceptable impulse or feeling.  &quot;And we may have a period of time either with or without activity that would be blocked out because we can't deal with [the fact that we have succumbed to that unacceptable behavior.]&quot; The doctor further testified that he had no opinion on the sanity of John Thomas Noland, Jr. at the time of the offenses because, with the reported amnesia, he had no basis for knowing whether John Noland was psychotic.  He testified, however, that there was &quot;a suggestion that he may not have known the difference&quot; between right and wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of all the evidence the jury found the defendant guilty of two counts of first degree murder, two counts of burglary in the first degree, and assault with a deadly weapon with the intent to kill inflicting serious injury.  Judge Gaines imposed consecutive life sentences for each burglary conviction and a consecutive twenty year sentence for the assault conviction.  The defendant and the State relied on the evidence presented during the guilt determination of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trial and did not present any additional evidence at the sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its instructions during the sentencing hearing in each first degree murder case, the court submitted one aggravating circumstance for the jury's consideration: the murder for which the defendant stands convicted was part of a course of conduct in which the defendant engaged and which included the commission by the defendant of other crimes of violence against another person or persons.  N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(e)(11).  The court also submitted to the jury sixteen mitigating circumstances, including three statutory mitigating circumstances.  The jury found at least one or more mitigating circumstances, without indicating which mitigating circumstance they found, and that one aggravating circumstance existed.  In each case the jury unanimously found that the mitigating factors were outweighed by the aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.  Therefore, the jury recommended the imposition of the death penalty for both murders, and it was so ordered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additional facts relevant to the defendant's specific assignments of error will be incorporated into the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his pretrial motion to bar the imposition of the death penalty on the basis that the prosecutorial discretion to seek or not to seek the death penalty violated his right to due process. Defendant also argued that the district attorney improperly and prejudicially read to the jury the law concerning amnesia and that the trial judge should have given a peremptory instruction to the jury that defendant had no significant history of prior criminal activity. The court affirmed. The court found that defendant failed to prove that the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in any way undermined the constitutionality of the death penalty statute. The court also found that defendant had not objected to the district attorney's remarks at trial and the state was well within the bounds of proper argument in reading the law on amnesia to the jury because the issue was relevant and fairly presented by the evidence. The court determined that there was some evidence of criminal activity and whether that evidence was sufficient to constitute significant history of criminal activity was for the jury to decide.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Gaines, Judge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 14 February 1983 Schedule A Criminal Session of Mecklenburg County Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was arrested on 5 July 1982 pursuant to warrants charging the first-degree murder of Roberta Hartsoe and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill Kathryn Hartsoe.  These offenses were alleged to have been committed on 4 July 1982.  On 16 August 1982, defendant was indicted for these crimes by the Mecklenburg County grand jury.  He entered a plea of not guilty to each offense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kathryn Hartsoe, the mother of the deceased and defendant's financee at the time of the crimes, was the principal witness for the prosecution.  She testified that she met defendant in Hickory, North Carolina in 1981.  At that time she was married and lived with her husband and four children in Newton, North Carolina.  She and her husband soon separated and Kathryn began to date defendant.  When defendant was transferred by his employer to Charlotte in December, 1981, Kathryn and two of her children, Chris and Roberta, moved to Charlotte with him.  The other Hartsoe children remained in Newton with their father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kathryn testified that in March, 1982, she went&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to a doctor complaining of nervousness and inability to sleep.  She stated that she was nervous because of her impending divorce from her husband, pressure from her family to marry defendant, and commuting each day from Charlotte to Hickory to her work.  The doctor prescribed an antidepressant, Activan, to help Kathryn relax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 24 June 1982, twelve-year-old Roberta told her mother that defendant had been &quot;messing with her.&quot; When Kathryn confronted defendant with Roberta's accusations, he admitted asking Roberta to get in bed with him on several occasions and fondling her.  Defendant apologized, saying that he was weak and he would make it up to Kathryn.  Kathryn stated that this sexual misconduct became a daily topic of conversation between her and defendant, but that she made no report to the police at that time because she was still trying to decide whether she would marry defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 4 July 1982, the date the shootings occurred, Kathryn drove her son to Denver, North Carolina to meet his father.  Roberta remained at home because she was being punished.  On the way to Denver, Kathryn stopped to telephone home.  She testified that defendant told her Roberta was being unruly and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that she could hear her daughter yelling in the background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Kathryn returned from Denver, the apartment was empty and there was a note on the door from defendant.  In the note, defendant explained that Roberta had run out of the house and that he assumed she had fled to her great-grandfather's house.  He said that he had gone there to look for her.  Kathryn testified that after reading the note, she called her grandfather's residence and defendant answered the phone.  He suggested that Kathryn come for Roberta.  Kathryn agreed and brought Roberta back to the apartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant came home shortly thereafter.  He told Kathryn that he and Roberta had been arguing and that during the argument, Roberta told him she wished he had been killed.  As Kathryn listened to defendant's account of the argument, she became hysterical and took two nerve pills to calm down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kathryn testified that she slept fitfully during the afternoon and upon awakening, she observed defendant standing beside her pointing a gun at her head.  He said something about not wanting his family to be humiliated and then fired the gun twice.  One shot grazed her ear and the other bullet lodged in the bed.  Defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  then said he was going to shoot Roberta and himself.  Kathryn tried to follow as he left the room but she was unable to walk.  As she stood leaning on the dresser in her bedroom, she heard Roberta moan.  Defendant reentered the bedroom, pushed Kathryn back down on the bed and said, &quot;Everything is going to be all right.  We are going to live together forever after.&quot; He then shot himself and dropped the gun to the floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kathryn testified that she kicked the gun under the bed and struggled to Roberta's room.  She found her daughter lying face down on the floor.  When Roberta did not move or respond, Kathryn ran to the telephone and dialed the emergency number to report the shooting.  As she hung up the phone, defendant entered the room, asked her who she had spoken to and fell to the floor.  At that moment, rescue personnel arrived and in response to their inquiry as to who did the shooting, Kathryn pointed to defendant.  Kathryn and defendant were carried to a local hospital where defendant immediately underwent surgery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Jeffrey Runge attended Kathryn in the emergency room.  He stated that she appeared calm and that she made no inquiry as to her daughter's condition.  After cleaning&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and dressing Kathryn's superficial wound, Dr. Runge released her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State also presented the testimony of Dr. Hobart Wood, who performed the autopsy on Roberta.  He testified that she had been shot twice in the back and stated that in his opinion, Roberta's death was caused by a bullet which penetrated her heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police had also responded to Kathryn's emergency call.  Officer Michael F. Warren stated that when he arrived, he noticed that Kathryn had been drinking.  After the victims were removed from the apartment, the officers found a small handgun under the bed in the master bedroom.  No fingerprints were found on the gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roger Thompson, a firearms expert with the Charlotte Police Department, stated that he examined and tested the gun.  In his opinion, each of the bullets removed from Roberta's body had been fired from the gun found in the master bedroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the State presented the testimony of Nebraska Massey, defendant's parole officer.  Massey testified that defendant was paroled in November, 1979, after serving thirteen years of a life sentence imposed in 1966 upon his conviction of first-degree murder.  Massey stated that defendant's parole would have been automatically&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  revoked if he was convicted of any crime other than a minor traffic violation.  He also stated that defendant was an exemplary parolee and that he had last visited with him on 2 July 1982.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered the testimony of Dr. John Edward Humphrey, Dr. Humphrey, a psychiatrist, testified as to the side effects associated with the drug Activan, which Kathryn Hartsoe was taking on 4 July 1982 for anxiety.  He stated that the drug is a central nervous system depressant and that, when combined with alcohol, the depressant effect becomes more intense and &quot;people can really get fairly intoxicated pretty quickly and can slur their speech and stumble around and have physical symptoms like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delores Withers, defendant's sister, also testified on her brother's behalf.  She stated that Kathryn called her on 4 July immediately after the shooting.  Delores hurried to the apartment and arrived there in time to speak briefly with Kathryn while she was in the ambulance.  Delores stated that she followed the emergency vehicles to the hospital.  Upon her arrival there, she was informed by a nurse that Kathryn wanted to see her.  Delores said that she located Kathryn in the emergency room and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  talked with her for a while.  She remembered that Kathryn wanted to know how defendant was, whether defendant had mentioned her and if he still loved her.  Delores testified that Kathryn apologized for what had happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's mother, Johnnie Mae Withers, testified that Kathryn also called her sometime on 4 July.  She stated that Kathryn said she still loved defendant and wanted to visit him.  She gave Mrs. Withers her telephone number in Newton and asked that she tell defendant to call her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned verdicts of guilty of first-degree murder and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court conducted a sentencing hearing before the same jury following the first-degree murder conviction pursuant to G.S. 15A-2000&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The jury found that the aggravating circumstances were insufficient to outweigh the mitigating circumstances and recommended that defendant be sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Roberta Hartsoe. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;The jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that two aggravating circumstances existed: (1) that defendant had been previously convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person, and (2) that this murder was part of a course of conduct in which defendant engaged and which included the commission by him of other crimes of violence against another person or persons.  G.S. 15A-2000(e)(3) and (11).  The jury did not specify which of the ten mitigating circumstances they found to exist.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The trial court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment on the first-degree murder conviction.  Defendant also received a ten-year sentence on the conviction of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, to run consecutively with the life sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant appealed the first-degree murder conviction to this Court as a matter of right pursuant to G.S. 7A-27(a).  On 30 December 1983, we allowed defendant's motion to bypass the Court of Appeals on the conviction of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill.  </SPAN></P>

The victim, the girlfriend's daughter, contended that defendant had been molesting her and when the girlfriend confronted him, defendant apologized and stated that it would never happen again. Shortly thereafter, the girlfriend was awakened by defendant standing above her bed with a gun. Defendant shot the girlfriend, shot the daughter, killing her, and then shot himself. Defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill and was sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal, the court held that considering the equivocal nature of the trial court's ruling, the fact that the jury was never instructed to disregard evidence of the girlfriend's references to the shootings as an accident and stated unequivocally that the jury could have considered testimony of a witness without heard the girlfriend say that the shooting was an accident, the evidence was never stricken, contrary to defendant's assertions. The court determined that the trial court acted within its discretion in imposing the maximum sentence for defendant's commission of the crime.</SPAN></P>

Gen.

Respondent Commissioner also enjoined appellants against further advertising, promoting or trading in new Jeeps. The trial court and court of appeals affirmed. On appeal, the court concluded that since the statute essentially protected franchisees from abuses of vertical integration and was not on its face designed to lessen competition or increase prices, the statute did not violate the Anti-monopoly Clause of the North Carolina Constitution.

A jury convicted defendant of first-degree murder and recommended a sentence of death.

He appealed from both the conviction and the sentence pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-27(a). On appeal of the guilt-innocence phase and the sentencing phase of the trial, the court affirmed. The court held that defendant was not denied a fair trial, for two jurors were properly excused when they stated that their personal beliefs would not allow them to impose a sentence of death. The court also held that defendant was not deprived of his right to confrontation when it limited his cross-examination of a state's witness. The scope of cross-examination rests largely in the discretion of the trial court. Absent a showing of an abuse of discretion or that prejudicial error has resulted, the trial court's ruling would not be disturbed on review. On appeal of the sentencing phase, the court held that defendant's sentence of death was neither disproportionate nor excessive considering both the crime and this defendant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We allowed discretionary review from the Court of Appeals, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Judge Hill</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, concurred in by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Judges Johnson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Phillips</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which vacated and remanded judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Greene (Edward), Judge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, entered 8 January 1982 in District Court, Harnett County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause involves proceedings to terminate parental rights of the respondent-appellees, Geraldine Montgomery and David Maxwell, in their four minor children.  The appellant, the Harnett County Department of Social Services, hereinafter referred to as petitioner or DSS, filed four separate petitions for termination of the parental rights to each of the four children.  For our purposes, we shall treat those four petitions as one.  Guardians ad litem were appointed for the minor children and for the parents.  At the time of the hearing in the Juvenile Division of the Harnett County District Court, the children were 10, 9, 7 and 5 years of age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the evidence presented at the hearing the trial court made certain findings of facts.  An order granting the petition to terminate parental rights as to each child was entered, citing as grounds for termination, neglect by the mother and both neglect and a failure to provide a reasonable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  cost of care by the father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts disclose that respondents Geraldine Montgomery and David Maxwell are the parents of these four minor children.  At the time of the birth of the first child, the mother was 16 years of age while the father was about 4 years older than the mother.  The parents were not married then and have not since legitimated their relationship.  The children lived with the parents until they were removed by DSS in September 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1978, the family has lived in a three-room house with one bathroom, located on the farm where the father was employed.  During the period between 12 October 1979 and 14 August 1980, prior to the September 1980 removal of the children, the house was sparsely furnished, having a single bed on which the parents slept and a mattress on the floor on which the four children slept.  The trial court found that &quot;[d]espite urging from the Social Worker, and despite the fact that financial resources were available to the parents from the husband's earnings and social services, the parents failed to provide additional beds or otherwise improve the crowded and inadequate living space . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Maxwell earned approximately $ 120.00 per&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  week as a welder and general handyman on the farm owned by his employer.  Ms. Montgomery tended to the house and children.  Testimony also revealed that the mother suffered from mental problems.  She often related to others that she believed someone was looking in the windows of her house and also that someone was trying to get inside her mind.  She continuously claimed, for a period of about 14 months, that she was pregnant, when in fact she had had a hysterectomy.  Psychological evaluations indicated that both the mother and the father were mentally retarded, having scored 55 and 54, respectively, on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the 1979-80 school year, the children of school age had poor attendance records, missing at least 34 days each.  Their grades were also unsatisfactory.  Subsequent to DSS acquiring custody of the children, their school attendance and performance showed much improvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner first became involved with the family on 16 October 1979 when a social worker visited the home.  During the following 10 months this same DSS employee visited the family over ten times, and found on different occasions the mother talking incoherently, the children&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at home rather than in school, and enough food in the house for one family meal.  After April of 1980 following the respondents' separation, the social worker visited the mother and children in the homes of her relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 5 September 1980, the trial court adjudged the children neglected and granted custody to petitioner.  The court found no improvement in the family's situation at either the 6 March 1981 or the 4 September 1981 review hearings.  The father failed to comply with the trial court's 6 March 1981 order to pay $ 30.00 per week for the support of his four children.  The cost of care to the DSS was $ 150.00 per child per month.  At the time of the 8 January 1982 hearing to terminate the parental rights, the father had provided only 3 of 45 payments, to wit, $ 90.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of the termination hearing, there was some evidence of progress being made with regard to Ms. Montgomery.  The mother was attempting to improve her homemaking skills with the assistance of DSS.  She also was receiving counseling and medicine for her mental problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other facts relevant to the specific assignments of error, will be incorporated into the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant state social services agency initiated proceedings to terminate parental rights of appellee parents in their four minor children. At trial, the state social services agency showed that the parents had neglected to provide the children with a bed for an extended period of time, were unmarried, were mentally retarded, and failed to pay support while the children were in the state's care. The trial court entered an order that terminated parental rights on the ground of neglect pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-289.32(2). The intermediate appellate court reversed on the ground that the evidence failed to show that the intangible non-economic needs of the children were not adequately met. On further appeal, the court reversed and reinstated the verdict. The court held that the intermediate court improperly expanded the grounds for terminating parental rights because the statute provided numerous safeguards to ensure that the termination decision was based on the best interests of the children, including notice to the parents, the right to examine witnesses, and the appointment of guardians ad litem.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee symphony successfully argued to the appellate court that in reviewing the unemployment benefit claims, the superior court was required to act as an appellate court and could not consider a basis for relief not presented to the Employment Security Commission (commission). For this reason, they argued that the superior court could not base its decision upon the theory of a &quot;group temporary layoff&quot; because that issue was not presented to the commission. The court reversed and remanded. The court noted that the function of the superior court was to ensure that the commission properly construed and applied the applicable law in reaching its decision, as well as determining whether the evidence supported the findings of fact, and deciding whether the facts found supported the commission's conclusions of law and decision. There was abundant evidence before the commission to require a determination of whether the &quot;group temporary layoff&quot; regulations were to be applied; however the commission erred by failing to recognize the issue. The issue was properly considered by the superior court, and the record supported the conclusion that the claimants were on a &quot;group temporary layoff.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was sentenced to death following his conviction for first-degree murder and he challenged the judgment. Defendant argued that the district attorney's unbridled discretion under the death penalty statute in deciding against whom he would seek verdicts of first-degree murder and the death penalty was unconstitutional. The court found no merit in defendant's claim. The court held that the federal constitution did not prohibit the use of absolute prosecutorial discretion in determining which cases to prosecute for first degree murder so long as such discretionary decisions were not based on race, religion, or some other impermissible classification. The court held that defendant failed to show that the district attorney based his decision to seek the death penalty against defendant upon unjustifiable standards.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the finding of guilt, finding that (1) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the participation of a private prosecutor, (2) the trial court did not err in refusing to admit evidence of a collateral matter, the credibility of a witness, and (3) the prosecution did not commit misconduct in its closing argument by emphasizing a racial motive. However, the court reversed the penalty phase, finding that (1) the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of the aggravating factor under N.C. Gen.

The court found that the evidence left the existence of the facts essential to support the ultimate conclusion in a state of conjecture and surmise.

The court articulated a new standard to evaluate cases that involve a collateral attack on a criminal conviction because of unrequested evidence that was known, but not disclosed, by the state. The trial court was in the best position to make factual findings as to whether the evidence, if it had been disclosed to the jury which convicted defendant, and in light of all the other evidence which the jury heard, was likely to have created in the jury's mind a reasonable doubt which did not otherwise exist as to defendant's guilt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These cases came on for resentencing following a decision of this Court reported at 302 N.C. 28, 274 S.E. 2d 183 (1981). At the first trial defendants were convicted of the first degree murder of Allen Watts and Dayton Hodge.  The murders of Watts, a store attendant, and Hodge, a customer at the gas pump, were committed during the course of the armed robbery of a convenience store.  Defendant Moore was sentenced to death for the murder of Allen Watts and to life imprisonment for the murder of Dayton Hodge.  Defendant Oliver was sentenced to death in both murders.  Writing for a unanimous court, Justice Exum found no error in the first degree murder convictions.  However, for error found in the sentencing phase of both the Watts and Hodge murders as to defendant Oliver, and the Watts murder as to defendant Moore, the cases were remanded for a new sentencing hearing.  Defendant Moore's life sentence for the murder of Dayton Hodge was unaffected by the remand for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

As the issues raised on this appeal relate only to the resentencing, we deem it unnecessary to repeat the facts.

Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(e)(9); that the crime was motivated by a desire to avoid detection and apprehension, N.C. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from the judgment entered by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Rousseau, Judge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 29 March 1982 Criminal Session of Alleghany County Superior Court, and from a ruling by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Davis, Judge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, on 20 October 1981, denying defendant's motion for change of venue or a special venire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, Bruce Franklin Jerrett, was charged with the first-degree murder of Dallas Parsons, felonious breaking and entering, kidnapping of Edith Parsons, and armed robbery of Edith Parsons and Tom Parsons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to trial, defendant moved for a change of venue or, in the alternative, for a special venire from another county.  These motions were denied by Judge Davis.  The motion for a change of venue was renewed both during and after jury selection and denied by Judge Rousseau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence presented by the State tended to show:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 24 July 1981, Dallas Parsons and his wife, Edith Parsons, lived on a dairy farm in the Piney Creek Community near Sparta, North Carolina.  Mr. Parsons' brother, Tom Parsons, and nephew, Tony Parsons, also lived at the residence.  On that evening, Mrs. Parsons retired at around 11:30 p.m. Her husband, Tom Parsons, and Tony Parsons had gone to bed earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before retiring Mrs. Parsons&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  locked the front door of the house, but she did not recall locking the back door.  She then joined her husband in their bedroom.  At around 3:00 a.m., Mrs. Parsons was wakened by gunfire and the lights in the bedroom being turned on.  She heard her husband shout &quot;Hey&quot; and &quot;Oh, God.&quot; She saw defendant standing by the bedroom door holding a gun in his left hand.  His right hand was on the light switch.  Defendant had shot Dallas Parsons.  He then turned his gun on Mrs. Parsons and ordered her to come to him.  Mrs. Parsons was screaming, crying and pleading with defendant not to shoot her.  She repeatedly told defendant that he had killed her husband.  Defendant again told her to come to him and Mrs. Parsons complied.  Defendant then grabbed her by the arm, but at some point allowed Mrs. Parsons to dress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant picked up a box of .22 caliber cartridges from a chest of drawers in the bedroom and said, &quot;That is what I am looking for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Parsons called from his room and asked what was going on.  Defendant dragged Mrs. Parsons across the hall to Tom's room and pushed the door against Tom's body.  He then pushed his gun around the door and demanded that Tom give him his wallet and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  money.  Mr. Parsons gave defendant approximately three dollars in change.  In compliance with defendant's order, Tom remained in his room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Parsons then pleaded with defendant to allow her to call the rescue squad.  He refused, but agreed to make the call himself.  Defendant went to a phone in the kitchen and dialed a number.  He told the person he was speaking with to come to the Parsons' residence.  He then asked Mrs. Parsons, &quot;What Parsons?&quot; She replied, &quot;Dallas,&quot; and defendant relayed this information.  He also stated, &quot;You will have to find that out for yourself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant then took Mrs. Parsons back to her bedroom to get her husband's wallet.  She gave defendant approximately eight or nine dollars from the wallet.  Defendant and Mrs. Parsons then went outside to the Parsons' automobile but Mrs. Parsons was unable to find the keys.  Defendant forced Mrs. Parsons back to the bedroom and obtained the car keys from Dallas Parsons' pants pocket.  While in the bedroom, Mrs. Parsons saw that her husband's leg was hanging off the bed.  Defendant told her not to touch him.  Despite this warning, Mrs. Parsons put her husband's leg back on the bed and put the sheet and blanket over&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his wound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Parsons and defendant again left the house.  Before they entered the car, defendant pulled Mrs. Parsons over to the porch and picked up a blue jean jacket and a milk jug which was half full of a liquid substance.  As they returned to the car, defendant told Mrs. Parsons that he was going to drive but she convinced him to allow her to drive.  Defendant sat in the right front passenger seat and held his pistol in his left hand pointed toward Mrs. Parsons.  He told her that he wanted to go to Tennessee, but Mrs. Parsons disregarded his instruction and drove the car in the opposite direction toward Sparta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a short time, Mrs. Parsons told defendant that the car did not have enough gas and that the needle was on empty.  As they passed a station defendant said, &quot;Damn you, you passed the gas station.&quot; Mrs. Parsons told him that the only place that sold gas that late in Sparta was &quot;The Pantry.&quot; He accused her of lying but permitted her to continue to drive toward &quot;The Pantry.&quot; In route, defendant told Mrs. Parsons to slow down because she might attract attention.  He also told her to dim the dashboard lights.  Before they reached &quot;The Pantry,&quot; they met a rescue vehicle&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with its emergency lights on heading toward the Parsons' residence.  When they arrived at &quot;The Pantry,&quot; Mrs. Parsons turned the automobile into the parking lot and pulled up to the gas tanks.  The lot was well-lighted and Mrs. Parsons saw a marked police car parked near the door.  Defendant told Mrs. Parsons that she would pump the gas.  She told him that they would have to pay for the gas before the clerk would turn on the pump.  He accused her of lying but she assured him she was telling the truth.  Defendant and Mrs. Parsons then left the car and walked toward the store.  Mrs. Parsons was walking in front of defendant.  Defendant had put the pistol in his shirt right above his belt.  As Mrs. Parsons walked toward The Pantry, she saw Officer Caudle standing in the store at the counter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Caudle saw defendant and Mrs. Parsons walking toward the store entrance.  Defendant was approximately two feet behind Mrs. Parsons, walking with his head down.  Mrs. Parsons was holding her hands in front of her in a prayer-like position.  As she neared the door and entered, she was repeating the words, &quot;He's got a gun&quot; and &quot;He's going to kill me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant came through the door with his&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  hand over his stomach and still looking down.  When defendant looked up and saw Officer Caudle, he looked away and went up to the counter.  Mrs. Parsons walked toward Officer Caudle and said in a low voice that defendant had a gun in his waistband area.  Caudle stepped around her and went to the end of the counter.  Mrs. Parsons continued to walk to the back of the store where she locked herself in a storage room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Caudle then approached defendant who was talking to the store clerk, Mrs. Mildred Pratt, about purchasing gasoline.  Caudle asked defendant for his identification and driver's license.  Defendant twice asked Caudle &quot;Why?&quot; before producing his license.  Caudle then started to search defendant, who seemed surprised.  He asked Caudle two or three times why he was being searched and told Caudle that he had no right to search him.  Upon being asked if he had a gun, defendant replied affirmatively and turned his pistol over to the officer.  Defendant was then arrested for carrying a concealed weapon and was taken to the patrol car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Parsons told Mrs. Pratt that defendant had shot and killed her husband, and Mrs. Pratt relayed this information to Officer Caudle.  Caudle&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  thereupon put handcuffs on defendant who asked why Caudle was doing this.  Caudle told defendant that &quot;this lady&quot; [Mrs. Parsons] said that he [defendant] had &quot;shot and killed her husband.&quot; Defendant replied, &quot;You can't pay any attention to her.  She is half crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant testified in his own behalf.  We summarize his testimony as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night of 20 July 1981, he was at Delmer Bowens' house and left with the intention of going to Bessie Royal's house.  On his way to the Royal house he fell in a creek.  The next thing he remembered was walking into &quot;The Pantry&quot; and seeing the officer.  Following his service in Vietnam he experienced blackouts, one being while he was still in the service and stationed in Germany.  On that occasion he left his barracks and went downtown to talk to a friend.  He stayed with the friend until three o'clock a.m. and then started back to the barracks.  He recalled walking out the door, but the next thing he remembered was being two miles from the barracks at around 7:00 a.m. He had no recollection of what had transpired during the four hours between 3:00 and 7:00 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some two years after he left the service, he was driving his car one night&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in Maryland.  The next thing he remembered was waking the next morning in his bed in his parents' home.  He looked out at his car and saw that the whole right side was damaged.  He had no idea what had happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had another blackout while visiting his mother.  He was talking with his family and suddenly he didn't know what happened.  His mother later told him that he got up and &quot;went at [his] sister and pushed her down.&quot; He recalled seeing his mother's face and when he regained consciousness he saw his sister on the floor of the kitchen.  He did not remember anything about pushing her down.  He had not experienced blackouts prior to his tour of duty in Vietnam.  While he was in Vietnam, he was exposed to &quot;Agent Orange,&quot; a defoliant used in that region.  Defendant further stated that he was examined in Newport News, Virginia for the effects of Agent Orange and was diagnosed as exhibiting symptoms of exposure to the defoliant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's mother testified that after he returned home from the service, he experienced numerous blackouts during which he would &quot;throw a fit or something.&quot; Afterwards she would tell him about it and he would say that he did not remember the incident. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defendant's father also testified that he had observed defendant on at least a half dozen occasions during which defendant was experiencing blackouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two psychiatrists were called by defendant as witnesses.  Dr. Groce, who examined defendant pursuant to a court order at Dorothea Dix Hospital, testified that he conducted a variety of tests on defendant; that he was familiar with a psychiatric disorder typically found among Vietnam veterans referred to as post-traumatic syndrome; that he did not diagnose defendant as suffering from this malady; and that in his opinion defendant would have been capable of forming the intent to commit the acts with which he was charged.  His diagnosis was that defendant was suffering from (1) an adjustment disorder with depressed moods, and (2) episodic alcohol abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Goode, a psychiatrist at the Bowman Gray Medical Center, testified on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that he examined defendant at the courthouse pursuant to a court order; that he had reviewed Dr. Groce's report but felt that the tests conducted at Dix Hospital were inadequate to eliminate a complex partial seizure as a diagnosis of defendant's condition; and that extensive tests including a &quot;CAT&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  scan would be necessary to make a proper diagnosis.  Following the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the trial court refused to admit most of Dr. Goode's proffered testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned verdicts of guilty of felony murder, armed robbery of Tom Parsons, armed robbery of Edith Parsons, first-degree kidnapping, and felonious breaking and entering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sentencing hearing was held pursuant to G.S. 15A-2000&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, following the first-degree murder conviction.  The evidence presented by defendant tended to show that he had never been convicted of a serious crime.  He was once convicted of &quot;drinking in public&quot; in Virginia.  Defendant's employer, Mr. Kennedy, testified that defendant was a hard-working employee and that he had a good reputation.  Two friends of defendant and his family from Maryland also testified.  The essence of their testimony was that defendant experienced a decided personality change after returning home from Vietnam.  He was depressed and troublesome and began drinking.  Prior to his time in the service, defendant was a law-abiding citizen.  He was described as a very likeable boy with a good reputation.  He had also attended church regularly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnny Coffin, who worked with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant, testified that defendant lived with him for eight months.  During this time defendant worked regularly, but drank intoxicants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three jailers at the Alleghany County jail also testified.  Their testimony tended to show that during his incarceration, defendant was a model prisoner; that while he was in jail awaiting trial, defendant spent a great deal of time praying, reading the Bible and drawing religious pictures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State presented no evidence at the sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court submitted two aggravating circumstances:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1. Was the murder committed for pecuniary gain?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2. Was this murder part of a course of conduct in which the defendant engaged and did that course of conduct include the commission by the defendant of other crimes of violence against another person?</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court submitted the following mitigating circumstances:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1. Does the defendant at the age of 33 years have no significant history of prior criminal activity?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2. Was the murder committed while the defendant was under the influence of mental or emotional disturbance?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">3. Was the defendant's capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  of law impaired?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">4. Did the defendant call the ambulance for assistance of Mr. Parsons while at the Parson residence?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">5. Did the defendant submit to arrest without resistance when approached by the police at the Pantry?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">6. Did the defendant exhibit good conduct and act as a model prisoner while incarcerated in the county jail?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">7. Did the defendant have a low IQ, it being 73?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">8. Did the defendant exhibit religious beliefs and practices since being incarcerated in the county jail?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">9. Was the defendant exposed to combat, chemicals, and stressful experiences while in Viet Nam?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">10. You may consider any other circumstance or circumstances arising from the evidence which you deem to have mitigating value.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that both aggravating circumstances existed and that these were sufficiently substantial to call for the imposition of the death sentence.  The jury also found that seven of the ten mitigating circumstances (numbers 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) existed.  The jury did not indicate answers to numbers 2, 3, and 10. The jury also found beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances and recommended&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that defendant be sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court sentenced defendant to die for the felony murder of Dallas Parsons.  Since the underlying felony was armed robbery, the convictions of armed robbery of Tom Parsons and Edith Parsons were arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first-degree kidnapping and the felonious breaking and entering convictions, the trial court found as a mitigating factor that defendant had no record of criminal convictions or a record consisting solely of misdemeanors punishable by not more than 60 days imprisonment.  The court found as aggravating circumstances that defendant was armed with or used a deadly weapon at the time of each crime; that a lesser sentence would depreciate the seriousness of each crime; that the sentence imposed for each crime was necessary to deter others from committing the same crime; and that defendant engaged in a pattern of violent conduct which indicated a serious danger to society.  The court imposed a sentence of 40 years imprisonment (the maximum allowed) for the first-degree kidnapping and a sentence of 10 years imprisonment (the maximum allowed) for the felonious breaking and entering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant gave notice of appeal.  He appealed his death&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sentence to this Court pursuant to G.S. 7A-27(a).  We allowed his motion to bypass the Court of Appeals pursuant to G.S. 7A-31(a) on the kidnapping and felonious breaking and entering convictions on 23 July 1982.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;New trial.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Alleghany County Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted defendant of felony murder based on the underlying felonies of breaking and entering, kidnapping, and armed robbery, on the grounds that the denial of defendant's motion for a change of venue was error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that defendant established a reasonable likelihood that prospective jurors would base their decision upon word-of-mouth publicity rather than evidence presented at trial. The court found that a requirement of voluntary release for an offense to constitute second degree kidnapping was implied in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-39(b) and properly included in the jury instruction. The court determined that the conflicting inferences arising from the evidence were for the jury to resolve, and there was sufficient evidence to carry the case to the jury on the question of first-degree kidnapping. The court held that the failure of the trial court to instruct on diminished capacity was not error, but the trial judge should have instructed the jury on the defense of unconsciousness based on evidence of defendant's blackouts. The court found that the trial judge properly submitted the aggravating circumstances. Evidence that defendant robbed the victims and stole their automobile indicated the crime was committed for pecuniary gain and physical and personal threats directed at the kidnapping victim indicated that the murder was part of defendant's violent course of conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the denial of defendant's pretrial motion for change of venue and the denial of his motion for change of venue by the trial judge required a new trial in both the guilt-innocence and sentencing phases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Friday, Judge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 4 February 1982 Regular Session of Buncombe Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged by indictment, proper in form, with the first-degree murder of Gillia Dianna Hennessee.  He entered a plea of not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State offered evidence tending to show that on 22 February 1975, the body of the victim, a former nurse at St. Joseph Hospital, was found in a rondette-type dwelling in Asheville which she had vacated on 20 February 1975. She was seen leaving her newly-occupied trailer home on 21 February 1975 by a neighbor, Mr. Morrow.  She did not return that evening.  On 22 February, Mr. Morrow and his wife went to her former dwelling and found Ms. Hennessee's body.  The police were notified and Asheville police and a S.B.I. agent came to the scene.  The officers found the victim partially nude, lying face up on the floor of the rondette.  They observed blood on the floor and walls in the bedroom and kitchen and on the clothing rod of a closet.  The blood was later analyzed and was found to be of the same type as the victim's blood.  Two halves of a brick were lying near the body.  Bloodstains and hair found on the brick were determined&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to be consistent with Ms.  Hennessee's hair and blood type.  No bloodstains were found upon a pair of pants and underpants which were discovered in the kitchen area.  The officers searched for fingerprints without success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Hudson, the Chief Medical Examiner for North Carolina, witnessed an autopsy of the body which was performed by another pathologist.  He observed six lacerations of the scalp and a skull fracture beneath one of the lacerations.  A brick-type material was imbedded in one of the lacerations.  The autopsy also revealed a fiber in the deceased's lung.  Dr. Hudson stated that in his opinion the fiber was probably taken into the lung by a breath drawn from a cloth material held over the victim's mouth and nose area about fifteen minutes before her death.  In the doctor's opinion, Ms. Hennessee died as a result of blunt trauma to the head.  He further testified that either of two wounds were sufficient to have caused her death.  He did not observe any evidence of a sexual assault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alphonso Pearcy testified that he encountered defendant at the Chabaz Restaurant in Asheville around noon on 21 February 1975. When defendant inquired as to the whereabouts of a mutual friend&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the name of McQueen, Pearcy offered to direct him to McQueen's residence.  Defendant drove the two of them in a gold colored Toyota to a rondette located near the rondette where Ms. Hennessee's body was found.  They left upon finding no one at the McQueen residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Ellen Toreson, who lived near the rondette formerly occupied by Ms. Hennessee, testified that on 21 February she observed a yellowish brown foreign car, similar to a Toyota or Honda, parked near the Hennessee rondette.  She saw a black man of medium build and height with short hair talking to Ms. Hennessee outside the rondette at about 3:00 o'clock that day.  She later heard a noise coming from the Hennessee rondette but was unable to see anything except that the drapes in one of the windows were parted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myra Elaine Allen testified that on 21 February 1975, at about 4:00 or 4:15 p.m. as she was going to a neighbor's house to make a telephone call, she saw defendant, who she knew as &quot;Teabags,&quot; leaving the Hennessee rondette.  She stated that in 1975 she made a statement to police officers consistent with her testimony, and that she was willing to testify in court at that time.  On cross-examination she admitted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that her husband had been convicted of a drug violation in 1981 and that he had asked her to testify against defendant.  She denied that she agreed to testify in exchange for a sentencing concession in her husband's case, but admitted that she had used narcotics in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In corroboration of the witness Allen, the State offered witnesses David Moss and Delores Poole.  Moss testified that he was a neighbor of Myra Elaine Allen and that she used his telephone at about 4:30 p.m. on 21 February 1975. The witness Poole testified that about five to seven days after Ms. Hennessee's death, Mrs. Allen told her that she had seen &quot;Teabags&quot; leaving the Hennessee rondette.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fred William Lee Hensley, the Chief of Police of the Asheville Police Department, testified that in 1975 he was a lieutenant on the police force and participated in the investigation of Ms. Hennessee's murder.  He stated that on 11 July 1975, Mrs. Allen gave him a written statement concerning the Hennessee murder.  This statement, which he read into evidence, substantially corroborated Mrs. Allen's testimony.  On cross-examination he testified that in 1975 Mrs. Allen stated that she would not testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Smith testified&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that in 1975 he and defendant became friendly while they were both inmates at Craggy Prison.  He said that defendant made statements about a nurse.  He testified that defendant said, &quot;that she was supposed to get some pills for him, Preludin, and he went up and she didn't have them and she got freaked out and he beat her with a brick.&quot; He further testified that defendant repeated the substance of this statement to him about six months later.  On cross-examination the witness stated that Delores Poole was his sister and that the witness Allen was married to his uncle.  He admitted that he had been convicted of breaking and entering and possession and sale of drugs on two occasions.  He stated that he was not guilty of any of these offenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Frances Pickens testified that in November of 1975 defendant told her that he had &quot;killed the white woman with a brick.&quot; She stated that defendant repeated the substance of this statement to her at a later date.  She further testified:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">And I asked him why did he kill her, and he said she was supposed to have brought him some drugs and he thought she had some money, but she didn't have no money.  She just had a checkbook.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On cross-examination, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the witness admitted that she had been convicted of larceny, assault, trespassing and possession of drugs.  She further admitted that she engaged in lesbian activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diane Lloyd testified that defendant told her that he had gone up on the mountain and killed a girl with a brick.  She further stated:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

He further told Mr. Matthews that on the morning of 21 February 1975 he had two teeth pulled and two teeth filled by Dr. Love in Black Mountain, North Carolina.  At around 3:00 o'clock he picked up his wife, returned to his home and remained there for the rest of the day.  In another conversation on 22 September 1981, defendant reaffirmed his statements concerning his activities on 21 February 1975.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the challenged instruction was erroneous because it permitted the jury to roam at will without making it clear that the falsehood as to defendant's whereabouts did not create a presumption of guilt or that, standing alone, such evidence was not sufficient to establish guilt. Neither did the trial judge inform the jury that such evidence could not be considered as tending to show premeditation and deliberation. Moreover, the court found a reasonable possibility that a different result would have been reached had the erroneous instruction not been given.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff landowners challenged the decision of the Court of Appeals (North Carolina) that affirmed the dismissal of their action against defendants, court clerk and others.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the judgment and affirmed it as modified. The court noted that two tiers of review had been developed for equal protection claims, and that when a governmental classification did not burden the exercise of a fundamental right or operate to the peculiar disadvantage of a suspect class, the lower tier of equal protection analysis, that required that the classification be made upon a rational basis, was to be applied. The court noted that the &quot;rational basis&quot; standard merely required that the governmental classification bear some rational relationship to a conceivable legitimate interest of government. The court found that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 156-81(a) and (i) met the rational basis test. The court reasoned that &sect; 156-81(a) and (i) impacted all individuals that resided in counties in which the court clerk appointed commissioners of drainage districts rather than holding elections, and as such did not burden any suspect class, that the right to vote was not a fundamental right, and as such &sect; 156-81(a) and (i) did not burden the exercise of a fundamental right, and that &sect; 156-81(a) and (i) bore a rational relationship to a conceivable legitimate governmental purpose.</SPAN></P>

Appellant later filed an amended complaint which incorporated by reference her original claim and asserted claims against appellee architects and others for negligent design and construction which was denied by summary judgment motion. The main issue presented was whether N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-50(5) which applied a statute of limitations for defective construction actions, was constitutional. The court concluded that the statute barred all claims asserted in this case against appellees and that the statute was constitutional because there was a presumption in favor of constitutionality and reasonable doubts had to be resolved in favor of sustaining the statute.</SPAN></P>

The ends sought by the legislation, the prevention or reduction of loss of life, property damage, etc., due to flood, fell within the scope of the police power. Enactment of the flood plain ordinance was valid under the United States Constitution and no taking occurred in violation of the property owners' right to just compensation. The classification was reasonable and the property owners were not impermissibly burdened under either the state or federal constitution. The classification created by the ordinance was reasonable and benefitted the property owners directly and indirectly by making available federal flood insurance and financial assistance for acquisition and construction purposes. The ordinance did not violate the equal protection guarantees under either the federal or state constitution.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged in indictments, proper in form, with the first degree murders of William Leroy Brown and Willie James Potts and with assault with a dangerous weapon with the intent to kill causing serious injury on Jerry T. Kelly and Gregory Curtis Anthony.  The jury returned verdicts of guilty on each charge and recommended the sentence of death in both murder cases.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Judge Snepp</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> imposed consecutive twenty year sentences for each assault conviction and ordered the imposition of the death penalty for each murder conviction.  On 26 August 1982 we granted the defendant's motion to by-pass the Court of Appeals on the two assault convictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In relevant part, the State's evidence tended to show the following: In the early morning hours of 18 May 1981, Ms. Jane Green, a resident of 3900 Rozzells Ferry Road in Charlotte, heard two gunshots outside her home and as she peered out of a window, she observed a small car leaving the area in front of her home.  At that time she saw a person lying in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the ditch on the side of the road.  She called the police.  While awaiting the arrival of the police Ms. Green saw a car, similar to the one she had seen in the area in front of her house, drive down Crigler Street and come to a stop.  The driver got out of the car, walked around and then returned to the vehicle and drove off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police arrived at the scene in response to Ms. Green's call and discovered William Leroy Brown lying in a ditch along Rozzells Ferry Road.  Mr. Brown had sustained a gunshot wound to the chest and two gunshot wounds to the head with a wound to the right forehead being fatal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately the same time that Ms. Green saw an automobile travel down Crigler Street, Mr. Gilbert Hargrove, a resident of 330 South Crigler Street, heard two gunshots.  Upon investigation Mr. Hargrove observed a car drive away from the dead end portion of the street.  After the car drove away, Mr. Hargrove saw a person stagger and fall three times.  He immediately called the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police arrived on the scene shortly after Mr. Hargrove's call and discovered Willie James Potts lying along the side of Crigler Street.  At that time Mr. Potts was alive but he was unable to identify&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his assailant.  Mr. Potts had been shot twice in the chest and he died as the result of a gunshot wound to the left chest.  The bullet passed through his left lung.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police investigation of each homicide scene resulted in the recovery of some bullets and bullet fragments.  On Rozzells Ferry Road, at the scene of William Leroy Brown's murder, the police recovered bullet fragments on the very spot where Mr. Brown's body was discovered.  In addition to the projectiles found at the scenes of these two murders, the medical examined recovered several bullet fragments from the cranial cavity of William Leroy Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly before 4:00 a.m. on the morning of 18 May 1981 Jerry Kelly was sitting in his car smoking a cigarette in the parking lot of Arby's restaurant located on East Independence Boulevard.  A small yellow car pulled up alongside of him.  After a short conversation with the driver of the small yellow car, the driver, whom Mr. Kelly identified as the defendant, shot Kelly in the neck.  As Mr. Kelly attempted to protect himself by lying down on the floor of his car, the defendant shot him in the elbow resulting in a permanent injury to the arm.  After being shot the second time, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kelly heard the car drive away.  The location of the assault on Mr. Kelly is approximately eight miles from the scenes of the two homicides on Rozzells Ferry Road and South Crigler Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 4:30 a.m., approximately thirty minutes after Mr. Kelly was shot in Arby's parking lot, Gregory Anthony was leaving work at Bojangle's restaurant on the corner of West Boulevard and South Tryon Street when a yellow car drove up and the driver offered to sell Mr. Anthony some marijuana.  Anthony identified the defendant as the driver of the yellow car.  Anthony and the defendant left the Bojangle's parking lot and went to Kingston Street where they smoked some marijuana.  While Anthony was smoking the marijuana, the defendant shot him in the jaw causing paralysis in Anthony's tongue and vocal cords.  In response to this assault Anthony pointed a replica of a gun at the defendant, who in turn ran away.  Anthony summoned the police who immediately responded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Harlee of the Charlotte Police Department, while investigating the shooting of Mr. Anthony on Kingston Street, observed a small yellow car traveling slowly by his location.  Upon stopping this vehicle, Officer Harlee found the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant in the driver's seat holding a silver pistol which was later identified as a five shot .44 caliber revolver.  A subsequent search of the defendant uncovered several spent .44 caliber shell casings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tests conducted by the Charlotte crime lab revealed that the defendant had recently fired a firearm.  Further tests showed that the bullets recovered at the homicide scenes on Rozzells Ferry Road and South Crigler Street and the projectile removed from Jerry Kelly's elbow had been fired from the .44 caliber revolver found in the defendant's possession at the time of his arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant gave a statement to the police which reads as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">I am giving Investigator Rick Sanders permission to write this for me.  Sometime after midnight, early Monday morning, I left a party at Jay's house off of Senaca.  I had taken a Quaalude at the party.  I was riding around and I rode over to Rozzells Ferry Road.  I seen a black male walking down the street, and I stopped and talked to him.  I don't remember what I said.  The next thing I know, I was shooting him.  I then went down a dead-end close by, and seen another black male walking.  I said something to him, and then shot&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  him.  A little while later, I went to Bojangle's Chicken on West Boulevard.  There I started talking to another black male in a little sports car.  He asked me if I wanted to smoke a joint.  I also told him I had something to sell.  I told him I was getting paranoid, and I wanted to go somewhere else.  He followed me around the corner.  I went to his car on the passenger side.  I had my gun on the left side with the holster unsnapped just in case he tried something.  As I got up to the car, he pulled a gun on me, and I pulled mine and shot him in the face.  I then ran back to my car and left.  A short time later, I came back to the road, and as I was turning onto the road, I seen Investigator Sanders.  I drove on down and was stopped by a black uniformed officer.  I was coming back to turn myself in.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A search of defendant's car resulted in the recovery of cocaine, marijuana, diazepam (valium) and another drug which is a non-controlled substance.  Drug use paraphernalia and some empty beer containers were also found in defendant's car.  In addition, the license tag on defendant's vehicle was bent upward in a manner which made it very difficult to read the number on the plate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dr. McBay, a toxicologist from the North Carolina Chief Medical Examiner's office, reported that blood samples taken from the defendant, approximately six hours after his arrest, revealed the presence of cocaine and diazepam (valium).  A similar test conducted by Dr. Bryan Finkle from the Center for Human Toxicology in Salt Lake City, Utah, revealed the presence of cocaine, diazepam (valium), benzoylecgonine and nordiazepam in defendant's blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout its presentation of evidence the State produced the testimony of witnesses who stated that the defendant's movements and speech patterns were normal.  Several witnesses also testified that the defendant displayed no erratic or unusual driving pattern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant presented evidence tending to show that he acted in self-defense in shooting Mr. Anthony and that he lacked the specific intent necessary to have committed first degree murder or assault with a deadly weapon with the intent to kill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numerous witnesses testified that the defendant was a heavy drug user and due to family problems had gone on a drug spree for the three days prior to the shootings.  According to the defendant's fiancee, Kim Strother, the defendant consumed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  large quantities of cocaine and alcohol three days before the shootings.  Further testimony of several defense witnesses indicated the defendant drank beer and took several drugs two days prior to the shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant testified that he &quot;partied&quot; on the night before the shootings, at which time he consumed large quantities of beer and cocaine.  His testimony concerning the shootings was very similar to the statement he gave the police at the time of his arrest with the exception that he also vaguely remembered talking to a white male before hearing a shot.  In short, defendant testified that he had a vague recollection of three shootings but was unaware of his thoughts at the time of each.  However, he did remember in detail the circumstances surrounding the assault on Anthony which he contends was committed in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Bryan Finkle testified that the amount of diazepam (valium) found in defendant's blood was greater than that normally prescribed for medicinal purposes.  Dr. Finkle also testified that the presence of cocaine and diazepam in the blood at the same time could result in considerable turbulence within the brain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant also called Mr. O. B. Starnes, a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  psychologist who had administered several psychological tests to the defendant.  Mr. Starnes testified for the purpose of establishing the professional manner in which the tests were administered.  These tests were in part the basis of the testimony given by Dr. Selwyn Rose, a psychiatrist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Rose testified that an examination of the defendant, interviews with his family, and the test results provided by Mr. Starnes revealed that the defendant was suffering from a mental disorder which by itself would not result in defendant's criminal behavior.  However, Dr. Rose testified further that defendant's mental condition when coupled with drug intoxication would prevent defendant from premeditating and deliberating his actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of all the evidence the jury found defendant guilty of two counts of first degree murder and two counts of assault with a dangerous weapon with the intent to kill causing serious injury.  Judge Snepp imposed consecutive twenty year sentences for the assault convictions.  The State relied on its evidence presented during the guilt determination of the trial and did not present any additional evidence at the sentencing hearing.  The sole aggravating factor&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  relied on by the State was that each murder was part of a course of conduct which included the commission of other violent crimes.  On the other hand, the defendant offered the testimony of seven witnesses, including himself and offered in part the following in mitigation: his age; that he had no significant history of prior criminal behavior; that the crimes were committed while he was under the influence of mental or emotional disturbance; that he confessed to the crimes; that he surrendered to police without resistance and that he expressed remorse for his actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its instructions during the sentencing hearing in each case, the court submitted one aggravating circumstance for the jury's consideration: The murder for which the defendant stands convicted was part of a course of conduct in which the defendant engaged and which included the commission by the defendant of other crimes of violence against another person or persons, G.S. 15A-2000(e)(11).  The court also submitted fourteen mitigating circumstances for the jury to consider.  The jury found that seven mitigating circumstances and one aggravating circumstance existed in each case.  However, the jury unanimously found&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in each case that the mitigating factors were outweighed by the aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt.  As a result the jury recommended the imposition of the death penalty for both murders, and the court so ordered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the trial court convicted defendant on jury verdicts of two first degree murders and two counts of assault with a dangerous weapon with the intent to commit murder and imposed the death penalty for each murder conviction, defendant appealed. The court affirmed the convictions. There was no error in the guilt determination. The court remanded for a new sentencing hearing. The trial court failed to properly peremptorily instruct the jury as to the absence of a significant history of prior criminal activity. The jury had to consider the circumstance in its determination of a sentence recommendation. The jury had to unanimously find that an aggravating circumstance existed before that circumstance could have been considered by the jury in determining its sentence recommendation. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion by refusing to impose a life sentence in each capital case on the basis that the jury could not reach a unanimous sentence recommendation within a reasonable time period. There was no prejudicial error in the prosecutor's remarks concerning the level of intoxication necessary to a defense to murder in the first degree.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On appeal as a matter of right from judgments of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bruce, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, entered at the 11 January 1982 Criminal Session of Superior Court, Onslow County.  Defendant was indicted, and after entering pleas of not guilty to each count, was tried and found guilty of (1) armed robbery, (2) kidnapping, (3) first degree rape and (4) first degree sexual offense.  The trial judge arrested judgment on the kidnapping conviction and imposed upon defendant a sentence of twenty years to life for the armed robbery conviction, a consecutive life sentence for the first degree rape conviction and a consecutive life sentence for the first degree sexual offense conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tended to show that on 31 March 1981, the victim, Mary Patricia Reep, received a telephone call in response to a classified advertisement placed by her in the Jacksonville Daily News in an attempt to sell a waterbed.  Upon request Ms. Reep gave the caller, a male, directions to her home where the waterbed was located.  The defendant arrived at the Reep residence approximately one hour after the telephone in quiry and identified himself as the person interested in buying the waterbed.  Ms. Reep then allowed the defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to enter her home for the purpose of viewing the waterbed.  The headboard was located downstairs, in the living room and the remaining parts of the bed were located in an upstairs bedroom.  After going to the bedroom where the waterbed was located the defendant pointed a gun at the victim's head and ordered her to turn around and cooperate or he would kill her and her eight months old child who was asleep in the room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant proceeded to tape the victim's hands together and her eyes closed.  After demanding to be told where any valuables were located in the house, the defendant gagged the victim with tape and tied her feet together with a scarf.  After rummaging throughout the house, defendant returned to the bedroom where the victim had been bound and gagged and forced her to have sexual intercourse with him against her will.  Prior to the sexual intercourse defendant attempted an act of sodomy against the victim and had placed his finger into her rectum.  After completing these sexual acts defendant removed several rings from the victim's hands and left, threatening her not to call the police.  The victim immediately freed herself and called her husband who in turn called the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  police.  Ms. Reep gave a detailed description of her assailant to the police and indicated that various items of jewelry were missing from the home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One week after the alleged crimes the victim underwent hypnosis in an attempt to recall additional details of the crimes and her assailant.  During the following few months the police, on three separate occasions, showed Ms. Reep photographs of various white males matching the description of her assailant that she had given the police.  On each occasion Ms. Reep unequivocally stated that her assailant was not present in any of the photographs.  However, on 12 August 1981 while viewing a photographic line-up consisting of six photographs the victim made a tentative identification of the defendant as her assailant.  Upon a request to view the defendant fully, the victim was summoned to a District Courtroom in Onslow County where the defendant and thirteen persons similar in appearance to defendant were present.  Upon entering the courtroom Ms. Reep identified the defendant as her assailant.  At the time of the identification the defendant was before the court in a case concerning obscene telephone calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant presented evidence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of an alibi defense that he was home in bed at the time of the alleged incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of all the evidence the jury found the defendant guilty of first degree rape, first degree sexual offense, armed robbery and kidnapping.  The sentences were ordered as previously indicated with Judge Bruce arresting judgment on the kidnapping conviction.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted that certain exhibits should have been discoverable at trial under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-903, that the trial court improperly allowed the victim to make an in-court identification, and that the state was improperly permitted to question the victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of armed robbery, rape, and sexual offense. The court affirmed these convictions, finding that the state's duty to disclose materials to defendant was made properly under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 15A-903, 15-904. The court found that the trial court considered the totality of the circumstances in deciding whether an in-court identification led to a confrontation and that the fact that the victim had been hypnotized prior to trial did not taint her testimony irrevocably. The court noted that, under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1226(b), the trial court was empowered to admit the introduction of additional evidence form any party to the proceeding prior to the verdict and declared that if defendant had been surprised by such he ought to have filed a motion at that time. Further, the court found that defendant failed to show how the verdict was prejudiced by contested police statements under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1443(a). Also, the court found that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-58.6, which protected rape victims during cross-examination, was constitutional because a legislature was permitted to distinguish between classifications for rational ends.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Davis, Judge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 17 August 1981 Criminal Session of Surry County Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was arrested on 27 November 1980 pursuant to warrants charging the murders of Johnny Parks Henderson and David Edward.  He was indicted for these crimes by the Yadkin County grand jury in January 1981.  On 21 April 1981, he was also indicted for the armed robbery of Johnny Parks Henderson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to trial, defendant moved for a change of venue, citing pretrial publicity as the reason for his request.  On 30 April 1981, Judge Long granted this motion and the cases were transferred to Surry County for trial.  The trial came on to be heard before Davis, J., and a jury at the 17 August 1981 Special Session of Surry County Superior Criminal Court.  Upon motion of the State, the three offenses were consolidated for trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant made a motion to suppress all statements given and evidence seized during the arrest and booking procedure.  The trial judge ruled that all of the statements and evidence could be introduced with the exception of $ 1,400 taken from defendant's home.  The trial court ruled that this evidence must be suppressed because it was obtained&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the police in response to questions posited to defendant after he had requested an attorney.  In so ruling, the trial court failed to make any written findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the evidence sought to be suppressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence presented during the guilt phase of the trial tended to show that on election day in early November, 1980, defendant was at the Windsor's Crossroads Community Building, a polling site for the regularly scheduled election.  The deceased's father, Parks Henderson, was standing on the lawn nearby.  Mark Hardy, a friend of defendant, testified that defendant turned to him and said that &quot;he didn't have no use for Parks or Johnny Henderson and some day they would just run into the wrong person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several weeks later, on 25 November, defendant went to work on his brother-in-law's farm.  The arrangement between the two was that defendant would do some chores and the brother-in-law, James (Sammy) Hall, would give him dinner and a small amount of money for cigarettes and other personal items.  Sammy testified that other than this small sum, defendant had no money that day.  When defendant finished his chores, Sammy drove him to the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  home of defendant's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Ladd.  Sammy testified that on the way to the Ladds', defendant confided that he and Ricky Williams &quot;was thinking about knocking Johnny in the head and getting some money off of him.&quot; Sammy warned him not to go near the Henderson farm and to stay at home.  Sammy also stated that about a week or so earlier, he had loaned his 30/30 Winchester rifle to defendant's father to go deer hunting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant and his wife resided with her stepparents.  Ben Cass, defendant's stepfather-in-law, testified that defendant spent the night of 25 November at home.  He further testified that on the morning of the 26th, he overheard defendant and his wife discussing the fact that defendant had no money.  Defendant reassured her that he would get some that day.  He then told the family that he was going to work and left the Cass residence around 8:00 a.m. riding his bicycle.  Sammy Hall said that defendant did not report for work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About two hours later, Theodore Wallace saw defendant at Wallace's store.  Ricky Williams, an acquaintance of defendant, pulled into the parking lot of the store and asked defendant if he wanted a ride.  Defendant said yes, and directed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ricky to take him to his mother's home.  The two then loaded the bicycle in the trunk and drove to the Ladd home.  Defendant went inside and returned a few minutes later carrying a rifle.  Ricky testified that as defendant claimbed back into the car, he told Ricky that &quot;he knew somebody he could knock off.&quot; At the time, Ricky thought he was kidding and took it as a joke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant then asked Ricky to take him by a friend's house.  Following defendant's directions, Ricky took several turns and then stopped not far from the driveway to the Henderson farm.  Ricky testified that defendant took a pair of gloves from under the seat of the car and said that he was going hunting.  Defendant then left the automobile carrying the rifle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miles Johnson, a mailman, testified that he rode by and saw the two men seated in Williams' car on the shoulder of the road.  At about 11:30 a.m., the Williams' car passed him, with only the driver in the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the same morning, Johnny Henderson was at work doing the chores at the Henderson farm.  He planned to attend a cattle sale in a nearby town that afternoon.  His friend, David Edward, was to go along.  Johnny contemplated purchasing cattle at the sale&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and he was carrying approximately $ 9,000 for that purpose.  He met David around 11:00 a.m. and, shortly thereafter, the two started to the barn to load cattle.  Parks Henderson, Johnny's father, last saw the two around 12:30 p.m. as they were going toward the barn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 1:00 p.m., as Parks was helping his wife unload some groceries, he heard two shots from a high-powered rifle.  He remarked to his wife at the time that it was unusual for Johnny to be shooting around the barn while he was loading cattle.  His wife then asked him to take some bread to a neighbor's house.  As he was leaving on the errand, he noticed someone walking near the barn.  He testified that the person was short, five feet or less, and wore a &quot;dull&quot; colored coat.  Parks thought the individual might have been David Edward.  Other testimony indicated that defendant was five feet, five inches tall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Parks returned to the Henderson farm, he became alarmed when he learned his son had not yet returned from the barn.  He ran to the barn and there discovered the bodies of his son and David Edward lying on the floor.  Both had been shot in the neck with a rifle.  Johnny's money was gone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parks Henderson returned&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the house and phoned his son, Jack Henderson, the Sheriff of Yadkin County.  After officers arrived at the scene, they conducted a search of the area.  About five and one-half inches from Johnny Henderson's body, a copper jacket was found lodged in a piece of wood.  By use of a metal detector, the officers located a piece of lead on the floor of the barn.  The copper jacket and lead fragment were later submitted to the State Bureau of Investigation for analysis, along with a 30/30 Winchester rifle recovered from the Ladd residence.  Stephen Carpenter, a firearms expert, testified that the lead fragment was consistent with the lead core of metal-jacketed 30 caliber bullets.  After test firing the 30/30 Winchester, Carpenter was of the opinion that the copper jacket found in the barn had been fired from the Winchester rifle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another item recovered from the area near the Henderson barn was a wallet containing defendant's driver's license and social security card.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anne Hardy, a neighbor of the Henderson's testified that at approximately 12:30 p.m. she also heard two gunshots which sounded like they were from a high-powered rifle.  Shortly afterward, she saw someone walking along the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  edge of the woods, coming from the direction of the Henderson farm.  She recalled that the person was ducking in and out of the woods, as if he was trying to hide.  She noticed that the individual carried a rifle and remembered that he held his hand over his jacket pocket.  Mrs. Hardy first testified that she did not recognize the person, although she did say that he was about the same height and weight as defendant.  Several days after she testified at trial, however, Mrs. Hardy notified the prosecutor that she had more to say.  She was then recalled and testified that she was sure the person in the woods was defendant.  She stated that she came to realize it was defendant when she saw his picture in the newspaper two days after the crimes were committed.  She was afraid to admit this when she first testified.  She conceded that she did not see the face of the man in the woods, but she was sure it was defendant for she had known him all her life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harold Sparks remembered that defendant came to his house on a bicycle at about 2:00 p.m. on the afternoon of 26 November.  Defendant told Sparks that he had come to return five dollars that he had borrowed several months before.  He also&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  offered Sparks an extra dollar if he would take him home.  Sparks agreed, and after loading the bicycle into the trunk of the car, drove defendant to the Cass residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When defendant arrived home, he remarked to his wife, &quot;I told you I was going to get that money.&quot; He explained that his cousin, J. Roy, had given him some cash.  Later that afternoon, the Cass family went into Statesville to go shopping.  Defendant bought a $ 200 stereo and a large teddy bear.  He gave his wife money to buy Christmas presents and offered to buy Mr. Cass anything he wanted.  He also treated the family to dinner and paid for some groceries.  J. Roy later testified that he had not given defendant any money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered no evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found defendant guilty of the first-degree murder and armed robbery of Johnny Parks Henderson and the second-degree murder of David Edward.  Thereafter, a sentencing hearing was conducted for the first-degree murder verdict.  The jury could not unanimously agree on the sentence to be imposed.  The trial court therefore imposed a life sentence for the first-degree murder as required by G.S. 15A-2000(b).  Defendant also received sentences of life imprisonment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for both the second-degree murder and armed robbery crimes.  All three sentences were to run consecutively.  Defendant appealed directly to this Court as a matter of right pursuant to G.S. 7A-27(a).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant shot two men and stole their money. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress with the exception of some money that the police recovered based on an interrogation after defendant requested counsel. Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, and armed robbery. He argued that he was entitled to a new trial because the trial court failed to make findings of fact. The court found no error. The court held that the conflict regarding the location of defendant's jacket was immaterial and that the necessary factual findings were implied by the trial court's ruling. Defendant's pre-Miranda statement was properly admitted because it was not made in response to police interrogation. Defendant's post-Miranda statement was properly excluded because defendant invoked his right to counsel, but the trial court committed harmless error in admitting his statement that he was going to reveal the location of the money after he spoke with counsel. The routine booking questions posited to defendant after he requested counsel were improperly admitted because they were intended to elicit an incriminating response, but the error did not warrant a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found no error in defendant's convictions for first-degree murder, second-degree murder, or armed robbery or in his sentences for life imprisonment in his appeal as a matter of right.</SPAN></P>

Defendants were arrested the following day. On appeal, the court found that: (1) statements by defendants were made voluntarily after they were advised of the rights and were admissible; (2) guns and other items found at a residence where defendant brothers occasionally stayed were admissible because the woman renting the home had authority to voluntarily consent to the warrantless search; (3) testimony by a witness going through the booking procedure at the same time as defendant brother was admissible because the witness was not acting as a government agent and had been told not to talk to defendants; (4) trials of defendants were properly joined and all parts of each defendant's confession that referred to or implicated any other defendant were deleted; and (5) the jury was properly instructed on common purpose to murder.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged in indictments proper in form with rape in the first degree, breaking or entering and larceny, armed robbery, larceny of an automobile, and escape from prison while on work release.  Defendant was convicted of each charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence presented by the state tended to show that on 20 July 1981 defendant was an inmate at the New Hanover County unit of the state prison system, serving sentences for assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer and assault on a female.  As part of his sentence defendant participated in a work release program in which on some days he was checked out of the prison in the morning, worked under supervision in the community during the day, and then returned to prison after work for incarceration during the night.  On 20 July 1981 defendant checked out of the prison at 7:00 a.m. and was supposed to return by 4:30 p.m. By 5:00 p.m. he had not arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state's evidence further tended to show that defendant reported for work the morning of 20 July 1981 but left at 12:30 p.m. Sometime between&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  12:30 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. defendant broke into and entered the home of Mrs. Brenda O'Connor.  When Mrs. O'Connor and her six-year-old daughter walked into the house about 3:15, defendant grabbed Mrs. O'Connor from behind and threw her up against the wall.  Defendant had a pantyhose loosely over his head and was armed with a knife.  Donald O'Connor entered the house shortly thereafter and defendant wrestled him to the floor.  Defendant forced the three victims into a bedroom, where he tied Mrs. O'Connor to her daughter and tied up Mr. O'Connor separately.  Defendant cut Mr. and Mrs. O'Connor's clothes off and then began kissing Mrs. O'Connor on various parts of her body.  Defendant allowed Mrs. O'Connor and her daughter to get up so the daughter could go to the bathroom.  Mother and daughter hobbled down the hall, hands and feet still tied.  After some scuffling Mrs. O'Connor managed to hit defendant with a garden spade.  Defendant then raped Mrs. O'Connor at knife point.  Before leaving, defendant took money from Mr. O'Connor's wallet, one of Mrs. O'Connor's rings and some jewelry.  He then took the keys to Mrs. O'Connor's car and drove away.  He had been in the presence of the victims&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for about three hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several hours after Mrs. O'Connor reported the assaults to the sheriff's department her car was observed parked in front of a house in Pender County.  A deputy sheriff and an employee of the North Carolina Department of Correction who arrived at the house saw defendant inside.  Defendant came out of the house, jumped off the end of the porch, and ran in a direction away from the officers.  After giving proper warning, the officers fired shots at defendant and eventually took him into custody.  Defendant was wearing green khaki pants and a green khaki jacket.  Mrs. O'Connor's driver's license and the keys to her car were in defendant's pockets.  A pair of crumpled pantyhose was found in the car.</SPAN></P>

Defendant offered alibi evidence and the testimony of his sister that she did not request defendant to set the fire. The jury convicted defendant of arson in the first degree, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Defendant appealed, and the court ordered a new trial. The court held that defendant was seized without probable cause under the Fourth Amendment because the deputy's statement that he would &quot;pick up&quot; defendant would have caused a reasonable person to have believed that he was not free to leave.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bailey, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judgments entered 14 May 1971, Criminal Session of Superior Court, Cumberland County.  Upon defendant's failure to perfect his appeal, the appeal was dismissed on motion of the State, 13 December 1971.  Defendant's subsequent Motion for Appropriate Relief was allowed 1 October 1981, whereby his appeal was reinstated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was indicted for first degree murder of James Earl Buckner, first degree rape of Gwen Davis, and kidnapping of Mr. Buckner and Miss Davis.  He was found guilty of first degree murder and of two counts of kidnapping.  Defendant was sentenced to serve a prison term of ninety-nine years on each of the kidnapping convictions, to run consecutively and to be followed by imprisonment for the term of his natural life to begin at the expiration of the kidnapping sentences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a basis for his appeal, defendant assigns as error the trial court's failure to submit to the jury the issue of defendant's guilt of second degree murder; its failure to require the jury to find that defendant acted with malice in order to convict him of first degree murder; error in the court's instruction on duress as a defense to the kidnapping charges; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  failure to require the jury to find that defendant acted unlawfully in order to convict him of kidnapping; and the court's denial of defendant's request for a voir dire prior to the admission of an inculpatory statement.  For the reasons set out in our opinion, we find no error in defendant's trial sufficient to warrant the granting of a new trial on his conviction of first degree murder.  For error in the jury instructions on defendant's defense of duress, defendant is entitled to a new trial on his convictions of kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facts pertinent to our decision in this case are as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Sisneros testified as a witness for the State that on 28 June 1970, he, in the company of the defendant, Danny Chance, and Charles Wilcosky, decided &quot;to have some fun&quot; after happening upon a black Pontiac automobile occupied by James Earl Buckner and fourteen year-old Gwen Davis.  Sisneros and the defendant were soldiers stationed at Fort Bragg.  The four men had met together earlier at the Drop Zone Club in Fayetteville, and after drinking for some time, they left in a white station wagon belonging to Chance's wife.  They chased some girls in another car &quot;like cat and mouse&quot; in the area of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yadkin Road.  Later they were approached by two prostitutes.  Sisneros told the defendant to leave the two prostitutes alone, and defendant replied that &quot;they were going to get some tonight and to stay out of his way.&quot; The prostitutes left.  The men finally targeted the black Pontiac and its occupants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant, using a gun he had earlier taken from Chance, ordered the two young people to join him and the others in Chance's car.  They drove to a secluded area, stopped the car, and defendant instructed Sisneros to remove Buckner and tie him to a tree with a rope provided by Chance.  After defendant had intercourse with Miss Davis, he found Buckner tied to a tree and re-tied him, putting the rope around the young man's neck.  Buckner began choking and gagging.  In response to Sisneros's warning that defendant might kill Buckner, defendant replied that &quot;it didn't bother him to kill anybody,&quot; &quot;that his unit got wiped out in South Viet Nam and that he had killed twenty-three people in Viet Nam.&quot; Defendant then proceeded to tie Buckner against the tree &quot;Viet Nam style;&quot; that is &quot;[w]ith his face to the tree, his arms wrapped around the tree . . . and his wrists tied around in that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fashion, his legs crossed behind him and the rope wound around his neck and head about three times.&quot; He then &quot;took off his shirt and wrapped it around Buckner's neck and started to pull on it, and just more or less hanging on to it, to choke him.&quot; At Sisneros's insistence, defendant stopped.  Chance was having intercourse with Miss Davis at this time.  He was followed by Sisneros, who, upon completing the act, saw Chance and the defendant walking up towards the road from the woods.  Wilcosky was now with Miss Davis.  Either the defendant or Chance told Sisneros that they had killed Buckner and put him in the bushes.  With Wilcosky still in the back seat with Miss Davis, the others got into the front seat and drove the car to a nearby tobacco field.  Defendant again had sexual intercourse with Miss Davis.  Defendant and Chance &quot;started talking about going two at a time with her;&quot; &quot;they tried, but it didn't work out too well.&quot; Miss Davis then got dressed.  Defendant stated that they had already killed Buckner.  &quot;Now who is going to kill her?&quot; defendant asked, looking at Sisneros.  Sisneros &quot;started to grab Miss Davis by the throat,&quot; pushed her back and let her go, stating that he couldn't&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  do it.  Then the defendant &quot;reached back and hit her in the neck with his finger tips, and she, she coughed, and then he grabbed her by her throat until she passed out.&quot; Miss Davis regained consciousness as defendant, accompanied by Sisneros, carried her to a creek where &quot;he was going to dump her in.&quot; Defendant dropped her on her head, stating that &quot;he thought her neck was broken.&quot; Miss Davis again regained consciousness and defendant attempted to smother her with his hand over her mouth and nose.  She stopped moving and defendant &quot;stood up and started to kick her about the head and shoulders.&quot; Meanwhile Chance and Wilcosky arrived and asked if Miss Davis was dead yet.  Defendant answered in the negative -- &quot;[b]ut she won't live very long.&quot; Chance then &quot;stomped her neck with his heel, with the heel of his shoes, and while he was going [sic] this, Andrew Strickland jumped on his back to make more weight . . . .&quot; Miss Davis was then thrown on some boards.  She survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four men returned to defendant's home where they stayed for approximately six hours, at which time Chance drove them to Fort Bragg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant testified on his own behalf.  He testified that after meeting with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chance, Wilcosky and Sisneros at the Drop Zone, he left with these men in Chance's car.  Chance chased a red Chevrolet with four girls in it.  Defendant asked to be taken home.  He did not jump out of the car because he feared for his life.  Both Chance and Sisneros threatened him with pistols.  He took Chance's gun and used it against Buckner and Miss Davis because Sisneros was there behind him with another gun.  He tried to help Buckner, and in fact cut him down from the tree.  Chance was the last man with Buckner and Buckner was alive the last time the defendant saw him.  He tried to help Miss Davis by telling her to run.  The others beat the girl while he asked them to stop.  Once they had returned to defendant's home, he didn't say anything to his wife because Sisneros still had a gun on him and he was afraid for his wife and family.  Defendant's wife testified that at that time she saw Sisneros standing close to the defendant with a gun pointed at him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On rebuttal, Sisneros denied ever using a gun.  He stated that defendant did not attempt to help Mr. Buckner and that defendant was the leader of the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. C. L. Neal, Sheriff of Harnett County, testified that on 30&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  June 1970, he took a statement from the defendant in the presence of Mr. Gregory.  In his statement, the defendant made no mention of being forced at gunpoint to participate in the crimes or of trying to help Mr. Buckner or Miss Davis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miss Davis testified that she never saw any pistol in Sisneros's hands; that the defendant never said anything to her about escaping.  She further testified that while talking to Mr. Buckner, they were approached by the defendant and three other men; that the defendant pointed a pistol at Buckner and ordered them both to get into a white station wagon; that during the drive, the defendant sexually assaulted her, against her will.  Buckner was removed from the car when they arrived at a place with two small ponds.  The men had sexual intercourse with her.  She was too afraid to resist.  She remembered little about the beating she received except for a hand around her throat.  She awoke lying on some white boards in a small ditch.  She walked to a farmhouse and was eventually returned home.  She was able to lead the sheriff to the area where Mr. Buckner was last seen and Buckner was found dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From a description of the white station wagon given to them&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by Miss Davis, the sheriff's department was able to trace the vehicle to Danny Chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. William D. McLester testified concerning the cause of James Earl Buckner's death as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">[T]he body was that of a white male, that appeared to be about the age of, that was given me of twenty-three year.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged judgments from the Cumberland County Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted him of first degree murder, kidnapping, and rape in a brutal killing that occurred during the kidnappings of the murder victim and his girlfriend and the rape of the girl by defendant and his accomplices. The appeal, initially dismissed for defendant's failure to perfect his appeal, was reinstated on his motion for relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who was convicted of first degree murder of a victim, first degree rape of the victim's friend, and the kidnapping of both, challenged his conviction on the grounds that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on second degree murder. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred when it failed to require the jury to find that he acted with malice in order to convict him of first degree murder and that the court's instruction on duress as a defense to the kidnapping charges was error. The appellate court affirmed the judgment of conviction for first degree murder because it found no error in defendant's trial sufficient to warrant the granting of a new trial on that conviction. In so doing, the appellate court expressly overruled State v. Harris and its progeny by holding that a trial court was not required to charge the jury upon the question of a defendant's guilt of lesser degrees of the crime when there was no evidence to sustain a verdict as to such lesser degrees. Because of an error in the jury instructions as to the defense of duress, the appellate court held that defendant was entitled to a new trial on his kidnapping convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the conviction for first-degree murder because it found no prejudicial error in defendant's conviction for that crime. However, the court reversed the kidnapping convictions because of prejudicial error in jury instructions. Because defendant's life sentence for murder was to begin at the expiration of the kidnapping sentences, the murder conviction was set aside and the cause remanded for formal entry of a new judgment.</SPAN></P>

Martin</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Harry C. Martin (now Justice)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> concurring) reported at 58 N.C. App. 597, 293 S.E. 2d 821 (1982). The Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of defendant's motion for summary judgment and the denial of plaintiff's motion for summary judgment entered by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Rouse, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, on 1 June 1981 in Superior Court, Carteret County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to 1 January 1978 defendant, Cecelia Young, lived in the Ocean Ridge Subdivision of Carteret County, North Carolina.  On 1 January 1978 the town of Atlantic Beach annexed some property contiguous with its western border.  Within this annexed area is the land on which defendant resides.  Prior to the annexation ordinance being passed and up to the present time defendant has maintained livestock upon the premises on which she resides.  At the present time she maintains two goats and one small pony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approximately eighteen months after the effective date of the annexation ordinance the town of Atlantic Beach enacted an ordinance which prohibits the keeping of animals, livestock and poultry within the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  city limits with an exception provided for house pets.  The ordinance in part provides:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Whereas it is deemed that the keeping of livestock, animals, and poultry within the city limits of the town is not consistent with the public health, safety and welfare, and indeed poses threats to both; then</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to keep, within the town limits, livestock, animals, or poultry other than housepets.  This prohibition shall be interpreted to include horses, cows, goats, sheep, chickens and turkeys, but this list is not to be deemed all inclusive.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ordinance prohibiting the keeping of animals, livestock and poultry was passed on 26 July 1979 and became effective on 26 August 1979.  The town of Atlantic Beach brought this action on 8 October 1980, more than a year after the effective date of the ordinance, seeking a permanent injunction against defendant directing her to remove all animals other than house pets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant maintains now as she did then that her two goats and one pony are house pets within the meaning of the ordinance and that her pets present no greater threat to the health and welfare of the town of Atlantic Beach&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  than any other house pet.  In support of her contention plaintiff presented affidavits of two local doctors of veterinary medicine and the sanitation supervisor for Carteret County, all of whom stated that defendant's animals did not constitute a health hazard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late April, 1981, after discovery was completed both plaintiff and defendant moved pursuant to Rule 56 of the Rules of Civil Procedure for summary judgment.  The motions were heard in the Superior Court of Carteret County by Judge Robert Rouse on 29 April 1981.  On 1 June 1981 Judge Rouse ordered that plaintiff's motion for summary judgment be denied and that defendant's motion for summary judgment be granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff then appealed to the North Carolina Court of Appeals which affirmed the judgment of Judge Rouse in an opinion filed 3 August 1982.  Pursuant to G.S. 7A-31 plaintiff petitioned for discretionary review by this Court.  The petition was allowed 5 October 1982.  </SPAN></P>

The town sought a permanent injunction against the individual which would have directed her to remove all animals, other than house pets, from the property. The court stated that the question of whether or not the two goats and one pony were house pets was misplaced. The court stated that the ordinance clearly stated goats and horses were prohibited. As a result, the individual's motion for summary judgment should have been denied and the town's motion for summary judgment should have been granted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued self-defense and absence of malice to the jury, but the jury returned a verdict of murder in the first degree. On appeal, the court assumed that the trial court had erred when it placed on defendant the burden of proving self-defense and the burden of proving that he acted in the heat of passion on sudden provocation, which would establish an absence of malice. However, the court held that the faulty self-defense instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence did not justify any instruction on the law of self-defense at all, because the record was devoid of evidence tending to show that the defendant believed it necessary to kill the victim in order to save himself from death or great bodily harm. The court held that any error in the jury instructions placing the burden of persuasion on the defendant to show absence of malice was cured by the jury's verdict of murder in the first degree, because that verdict required that the jury find beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant killed his victim with premeditation, which necessarily required that defendant did not act in the heat of passion.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was tried during the 21 November 1981 Session of Superior Court, Craven County.  The life sentence was imposed after a jury found defendant guilty of first-degree murder.  Defendant was also convicted of conspiring to commit murder, a felony, and given a ten-year prison term on that conviction.  On 24 May 1982 we allowed defendant's motion under G.S. 7A-31(b) (1981) to bypass the Court of Appeals on the conspiracy to commit murder conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant raises a potpourri of contentions in this appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant hired her lover to kill her husband, promising him a portion of the husband's life insurance proceeds. The lover, outside defendant's presence, fired the fatal shot. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support convictions of first-degree murder as an accessory before the fact and conspiracy to commit murder. Defendant was barred by N.C. R. App. P. 10(b)(2) from raising as error the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on the defense of abandonment of a criminal enterprise. As the constitutionality of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;15A-626 (1978) was not raised at the trial level, the court had no jurisdiction to consider it on appeal. Notice that the murder charge carried a possible death penalty was not constitutionally required. Defendant made no showing that the verdict was improperly influenced by the trial court's curtailment of her cross-examination of the lover. The improprieties in the prosecutor's closing statements were cured and possible prejudice to defendant was avoided with each instruction to disregard the improper statement. The court found defendant's post-appeal motions without merit. The 10-year prison sentence for conspiracy was incorrect.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The primary question on this appeal is whether the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency's issuance of bonds to finance single and multi-family housing for persons of moderate income serves a public purpose and is, therefore, a valid exercise of the power to tax under article V, section 2(1) of the North Carolina Constitution.  </SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 122A-5.4 (1981) was for a lawful purpose and not in conflict with N.C. Const. art. V, &sect;&sect; 2, 4, or 5.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission determined that it could not carry out its duties in connection with the sale of the Agency's moderate housing bonds because the constitutionality of the bond issuance was in doubt.

The court held that &sect; 122A-5.4, amending the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 122A-1 to 122A-23 (1981 &amp; Sum. Supp. 1981), was enacted for a public purpose, and was, therefore, a valid exercise of the state's power to tax under N.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 2(1). In so holding, the court observed that the public purpose of the Act to provide decent residential housing had not changed, only the economy had. The legislature appropriately responded to the changing conditions in the residential housing market, and the benefits flowing from the amendment to the Act were benefits for the common good of all the people of the state. The definition of those who were otherwise unable to obtain such housing was appropriately expanded to include persons and families of moderate income, as well as those of lower income.</SPAN></P>

Because the evidence plainly raised the question of the validity of defendant's seizure, the court held that it was error to rely on the presumption that the search warrant was valid. The court however refused to apply the exclusionary rule of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1343(b)(15) to probation revocation hearings. The court ruled that although defendant's rights were violated by an officer unaware of his status, the evidence derived from the unconstitutional search and seizure was admissible because to exclude it would not further the interest of deterring police misconduct, and overruled case precedent conflicting with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Gavin, Judge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 14 November 1978 Criminal Session of Guilford County Superior Court, High Point Division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged in a bill of indictment, proper in form, with the armed robbery of Furniture Buyers Center, Inc., in High Point, North Carolina.  Defendant entered a plea of not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prior procedural history of this case is important for a proper understanding of defendant's arguments.  Defendant was initially charged by warrant.  He made a motion pursuant to G.S. 15A-281 requesting a lineup.  Defendant's motion was granted, and the lineup was ordered to be held on 16 August 1978.  This order was orally rescinded by Judge Yeattes when he learned the State intended to take a voluntary dismissal of the case on 17 August 1978.  The State did dismiss the action on 17 August and no lineup was held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the case was dismissed in district court, defendant was led in handcuffs from the lockup beside the courtroom down the hall.  One of the State's witnesses, Albert Rice, was standing in the hallway at the time and testified that he recognized defendant as he passed by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on 17 August 1978, after the dismissal of the action in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  district court, the State's witnesses, Terrie Cecil and Mike Hughes, were taken to the High Point Police Department where they were shown a series of photographs.  Both witnesses identified defendant from the fifteen pictures in the photographic display.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 5 September 1978, the grand jury returned a true bill of indictment charging defendant with armed robbery of the Furniture Buyers Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At defendant's request, a lineup was held on 9 November 1978.  Witnesses Cecil and Hughes immediately identified defendant.  Witness Rice testified that he first marked number three but asked the officer conducting the lineup if he could change his ballot.  He was given a new ballot and correctly marked defendant's number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, the State offered evidence tending to show that on 13 February 1978, at approximately 11:30 a.m., three black men entered the Furniture Buyers Center in High Point.  Terrie Cecil, an employee of the Furniture Buyers Center, testified that the three black males came into the building and stood in the hallway outside her office for a few moments.  They did not arouse her suspicion at that point, and she left her desk to walk back to the catalog room.  One of the black&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  men entered the catalog room and told her she was needed in her office.  When she returned to her desk, everyone in the room was lying on the floor.  She, too, was pushed to the floor as the black men announced they were going to rob the Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On voir dire she testified that she could identify defendant as one of the three black men who robbed the Center.  She stated that she could identify him from having seen him on the day of the robbery, independent of the photographic display and lineup.  She was thereafter permitted to make an in-court identification in the presence of the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another of the State's witnesses was able to make a positive identification of defendant.  Mike Hughes, a furniture salesman, was present at the Furniture Buyers Center on the morning of the robbery.  Hughes testified that he was in the secretary's office when he heard a commotion in the hall.  He looked up from his chair to see what was happening when defendant peered through the doorway.  A few seconds later, three black males burst into the office and shouted, &quot;This is a robbery, everyone on the floor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court determined on voir dire that Hughes' identification was premised solely on his observations&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of defendant at the Furniture Buyers Center, and he was permitted to make an in-court identification of defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albert Rice, a self-employed furniture salesman who had an office at the Center, was the third witness to identify defendant as one of the robbers.  He also testified that he was in the secretary's office when defendant first looked through the doorway.  He complied with the robbers' demand to lie on the floor.  Rice testified that defendant then grabbed him by the arm, put a gun to his head and shoved him into the office where the safe was located.  The safe was open but there was no money in it.  One of the robbers kicked Mr. Rice and demanded to know where the money was.  When Rice told them he did not know, the robbers searched him and took from his person $ 1,480.00 and a check for $ 1,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On voir dire, Rice testified his identification of defendant was based solely on his observations made at the time of the alleged criminal incident.  When the jury returned, Rice resumed his testimony and, like Hughes and Cecil, identified defendant as one of the perpetrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State also offered the testimony of Raynard Reeves.  Reeves stated that he, defendant and another&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  black male robbed the Furniture Buyers Center on 13 February 1978.  He admitted that he pled guilty to this crime pursuant to a plea bargain and received a sentence of eighty years.  Reeves' testimony regarding the details of the robbery was very sketchy; he could not remember the location of the Center nor could he remember what he did after the robbery.  He attributed his faulty memory to the fact that he was on heroin at the time of the robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the State rested but before defendant put on any evidence, the State was permitted to reopen its case for the purpose of having defendant plead to a special indictment alleging that he had been previously convicted of armed robbery.  Defendant, out of the presence of the jury, admitted the previous conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered evidence in the nature of an alibi.  Katie Jackson, defendant's mother, testified that defendant drove her to work on 13 February 1978 and that they left her home in Winston-Salem to drive to Clemmons sometime before 12:00 noon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After defendant's argument to the jury, the State was permitted to reopen its case to present additional testimony from Albert Rice.  In clarification, Mr. Rice testified that of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the money taken from him, $ 1,400 belonged to the Furniture Buyers Center while $ 80.00 and the $ 1,000 check belonged to him.  The court asked Rice to define his relationship to the Center.  He testified that he was a buyer and salesman with no ownership interest in the Center.  On further questioning from the court, he stated that he was in charge of the Furniture Buyers Center on the day the robbery occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict of guilty of armed robbery, and the court imposed a life sentence.  Defendant gave notice of appeal.  When no record had been filed on appeal after two extensions of time had been granted, Judge Washington dismissed defendant's appeal.  We allowed defendant's petition for writ of certiorari on 12 January 1982.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted and found guilty of armed robbery in the Criminal Session of the Guilford County Superior Court, High Point Division (North Carolina).

The court allowed the defendant's petition for a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defendant was initially charged by warrant and filed a motion pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-281 requesting a lineup, which was granted. But the prosecution voluntarily dismissed the case without holding the lineup. After subsequent witness identifications in person and by photograph, the defendant was indicted and then identified in a lineup. The court found no error and held that: (1) the defendant had no statutory right to demand a lineup when charges were no longer pending against him and the in person identification was not so damaging that the subsequent photographic and physical lineups were constitutionally tainted; (2) there was clear and convincing evidence that the in-court identifications were independent and free of constitutional error; (3) the trial court's examination of a prosecution witness did not violate N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1222; (4) N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-928 was inapplicable because the defendant's prior conviction for armed robbery did not raise the offense for which the defendant was currently charged to one of a &quot;higher grade&quot; and was not a statutory element that had to be proved; and (5) all other assignments of error were overruled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found no error and did not disturb the trial court's entry of a judgment of conviction and sentence against the defendant for armed robbery.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged in indictments, proper in form, with the murders of Christina S. Chalflinch and Shelly Diane Chalflinch.  Due to pretrial publicity, the trial court ordered the trial moved from Moore County, where the crimes occurred, to Union County.  The jury found defendant guilty of the two counts of first degree murder and recommended that defendant be sentenced to death for both convictions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Union County (North Carolina), which convicted him of two counts of first degree murder and sentenced him to death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Blood stains on various items in defendant's apartment and other evidence linked him to two murders. He was found guilty and the trial court imposed the death sentence. Defendant brought several assignments of error relating to both the guilt and sentencing phases of his trial. First, the court concluded that although defendant was not entitled, under the terms of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-903(d), to inspect the crime scene as a matter of right; he did have a due process right to inspect the scene under police supervision. But, the denial of this right was harmless. Second, the court determined it was proper to exclude testimony which contained no evidence exculpatory to the defendant. Third, the court held that the issuance and service of the search warrant in no way negated the consent originally given by defendant for the search of his premises and that the items seized during the search were admissible at trial. And finally, the State was not required during the sentencing to give defendant notice of aggravating circumstances and any evidence that would have been admissible during the guilt determination phase was admissible at the sentencing phase.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On certiorari to review order of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Yeattes, Judge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, entered 25 November 1980 in District Court, Guilford County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause consists of two proceedings instituted in the district court in January 1980 to terminate the parental rights of Bruce Kelly Moore and Lillie Ruth Moore in two of their minor children, twins Connie and Donnie Moore.  It appears that from the outset the two proceedings have been treated as one and they are so treated here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 7 February 1980 the father, Bruce Moore, executed a document releasing the children for adoption.  Mrs. Moore timely filed an answer in which she opposed the relief sought by petitioner, the Guilford County Department of Social Services. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She also moved for a trial by jury and moved pursuant to G.S. 1A-1, Rule 12(b), that the proceedings be dismissed for failure to state a claim for relief.  These motions were denied.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Hereinafter the Guilford County Department of Social Services may be referred to as petitioner or DSS and Mrs. Moore may be referred to as respondent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following a lengthy hearing beginning on 24 September 1980 the court made findings of fact to which there is no exception.  The facts, as found by the court and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  established by the record, are summarized in pertinent part as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Connie and Donnie Moore were born on 27 July 1968.  In December 1973 Mrs. Moore signed a dependency petition requesting that DSS take custody of the twins because their father was in jail and she was about to enter L. Richardson Hospital for psychiatric treatment.  While she was hospitalized and immediately thereafter, employees of DSS counseled with her about leaving her husband, arranged for her to receive Supplemental Security Income benefits, and helped her locate an apartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Moores reconciled in January 1974 and in February thereafter the court ordered the children returned to them.  Both before and after the children were returned to their parents, a social worker stressed the importance of the family's not living with relatives, having separate rooms for the children, and family stability.  Following the return of the children, the Moores continued to have contact with the DSS.  At Mrs. Moore's request, a social worker arranged for the twins to have their preschool inoculations and to be enrolled in first grade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Connie began school she was reported as being disruptive in class, using vulgar&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  language, hitting other children, and acting out sexual intercourse.  She complained of vaginal pain.  After her parents did not respond to attempts by school personnel to confer with them, on 15 November 1974 the principal went to the Moores' home and took them to the school for a conference.  A social worker took Mrs. Moore and the children to a health clinic where Connie was treated for a vaginal inflammation.  On the same day the DSS filed a petition alleging that both children were neglected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A hearing was held pursuant to the petition in December and the parents were represented by counsel.  Custody of the children was placed with the DSS, with Donnie to remain in the home under DSS supervision.  Although Donnie was reported as sleeping a lot when he began school, there were no reports of disruptive behavior by him or of specific instances of neglect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Moore's hostile behavior toward the female social worker then on the case caused DSS to assign another social worker, Richard Gainer, to the case.  Mr. Gainer took over on 1 April 1975.  After familiarizing himself with the Moore's records with DSS, Mr. Gainer went to the home for his first visit.  Upon arrival he discovered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the Moores were facing eviction and that Mr. Moore was in hiding because he expected to be arrested for failing to comply with a court order to pay a sum of money.  Mr. Moore was quite hostile and was drinking heavily at that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April of 1975 Donnie was placed in a foster home.  From that time until February of 1976 he lived in four foster homes.  From 20 February 1976 to 24 July 1979 he lived in one foster home.  The foster parents in this last home requested Donnie's removal rather abruptly when they began having serious marital problems.  Between July of 1979 and September of 1980 he was in two foster homes.  Altogether, he had been in six foster homes at the time of the termination hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between December of 1974 and the termination hearing in September 1980 Connie had been in either seven or nine foster homes.  During this period Connie was also placed in North Carolina Memorial Hospital for psychiatric treatment and in Thompson Children's Home.  Between May of 1980, when she left Thompson, and the termination hearing in September, she had been in two homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. and Mrs. Moore continued to have economic and marital difficulties after the children were removed from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  their home.  They moved frequently and applied to DSS for help in finding housing and for money.  In December 1975 they filed a motion with the court seeking to have custody of the children returned to them.  The court found that they were &quot;still unfit&quot; to have the children and dismissed the motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1975 the Moores have had 16 different addresses in or near seven different cities or towns.  Mrs. Moore left her husband in 1977 and after a two year separation, obtained a divorce on 8 October 1979.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between December 1974 and September 1980 Mrs. Moore paid 11 visits to Connie and nine visits to Donnie.  For a period of three years, July 1976 to July 1979, there were no visits nor any other communication with the children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gainer had some contact with Mrs. Moore in June and August of 1977 but did not try to involve her in Connie's therapy which was then in process.  In September 1978 Mr. Moore telephoned Mr. Gainer and attempted to arrange a visit with the children, with his fiancee present.  Mr. Gainer would not allow a visit in the presence of the fiancee and Mr. Moore did not visit.  In May 1979 Mrs. Moore telephoned DSS indicating that she was living in the mountains, expected&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to get a divorce soon thereafter, wanted to see her children but had no way of getting to Greensboro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July of 1979 Mrs. Moore visited with Connie at the DSS office in Greensboro.  Since Donnie had just been moved from his foster home of three years, Mr. Gainer thought it wise that he not see his mother at that time and scheduled an appointment for Mrs. Moore sometime later.  Mrs. Moore had no way to get to Greensboro from the mountains for that visit and did not keep the appointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Moore did not visit with either of the children again until after she received notice of the termination petition in February 1980.  Mrs. Moore never gave either of the children a Christmas, Easter or birthday present while they were in foster care until after the termination petition was filed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, DSS reached a decision to seek termination of the Moore's parental rights and to try to place the twins for adoption.  The termination petition was filed on 17 January 1980.  As stated above, Mr. Moore voluntarily released the children for adoption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mrs. Moore received notice of the termination petition in February 1980, she employed a cab to drive her to Winston-Salem where she could&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  get a bus to Greensboro.  She lived with friends until she found a place in the country where she could have a garden and which she thought would be suitable for the children.  She resumed counseling at Guilford County Mental Health Center and kept her appointments.  She had some visits with the children.  She also enrolled at Guilford Technical Institute for purpose of learning to read and doing basic arithmetic.  She did not apply to DSS for financial or other aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approximately six months after the termination petition was filed, on 2 July 1980, Mrs. Moore asked the social worker what amount of money she should pay for the children's support.  Fifteen dollars per week was suggested although Mrs. Moore offered to pay $ 40 per week.  Nothing was ever paid.  DSS paid Thompson Children's Home $ 28,883.96 for Connie's care.  Foster parents are paid $ 142.50 per month and the children receive Medicaid.  DSS furnishes their clothing.  Mrs. Moore testified at the termination hearing that she could not afford to pay anything for the children's support because her automobile insurance premium was unexpectedly high.  Mrs. Moore owns a 1971 Cadillac, and another car, plus a pickup truck which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  she rents out for $ 50 per week.  She also receives $ 218 per month in social security benefits.  Her automobile insurance is $ 800 per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Moore dropped out of the program at Guilford Technical Institute because she could not get to school on account of &quot;gas problems.&quot; Further, although in February 1980 Mrs. Moore went to DSS and stated that she was then in a position to take care of the children and that she was going to move in with a brother in Ashe County who had agreed to take both of the children, she later wondered if the brother was willing to have children with discipline problems and did not know if she could handle Connie's problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donnie has been provided with counseling sessions with a psychiatrist due to the fact that he began &quot;acting out&quot; and being defiant.  His behavior has improved considerably since 31 March 1980.  Donnie does not want to return to his mother.  His school performance has improved in his current foster placement and his work is much more stabilized and acceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although much improved, Connie still has some behavior problems and is slow academically.  She is in a special education class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on its findings of fact the trial court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  concluded as a matter of law that (1) Mrs. Moore has neglected the children; (2) she has wilfully left the children in foster care for more than two years and substantial progress has not been made to the court's satisfaction in correcting the conditions which led to the removal of the children; and (3) the children have been placed in the custody of the DSS and Mrs. Moore has failed for a period of six months to pay a reasonable portion of the costs of their care.  The court ordered that the parental rights of Mrs. Moore be terminated and that the children remain in the custody of the DSS until such time as they can be placed for adoption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Moore appealed to the Court of Appeals and the record on appeal was duly served and filed in that court.  Briefs were filed and the cause was heard on 1 September 1981.  The Court of Appeals concluded that because the notice of appeal had not been filed within 10 days after entry of Judge Yeattes' order as G.S. 1-279(c) and Appellate Rule 3(c) require, the appeal must be dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Moore petitioned this court for discretionary review under G.S. 7A-31.  This court treated the petition as one for a writ&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of certiorari to review the order of the trial court and allowed the petition on 12 January 1982.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner Guilford County Department of Social Services (DSS) (North Carolina) instituted proceedings to terminate the parental rights of the minor children's parents. The mother opposed the termination. The District Court for Guilford County (North Carolina) terminated the parental rights, under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-289.32(2)-(4). The mother sought review, and the court granted discretionary review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the children were young, the mother signed a dependency petition, allowing DSS to take custody of the children. The children were shuffled from foster home to foster home. During the seven years that the children were in foster care, the mother rarely visited them and did not send them cards or gifts. After DSS filed the termination petition, the father voluntarily released the children for adoption. In terminating the parental rights, the trial court found that the mother had neglected the children, under &sect; 7A-289.32(2) and N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-517(21) (formerly N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-278(4)), and that she willfully left the children in foster care for more than two years, under &sect; 7A-289.32(3).

In affirming the judgment, the court held that &sect; 7A-289.32(2) and (3) and &sect; 7A-517(21) were not unconstitutionally vague, as people of common intelligence would not have to guess at their meaning. The court found that the evidence supported the trial court's finding that the children were &quot;neglected,&quot; under &sect; 7A-517(21), as they never received proper care, supervision, or discipline from their mother.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The worker filed a complaint seeking damages for injuries sustained when his hand was caught in a yarn crimping machine owned by his employer. The worker alleged that the manufacturer had negligently designed, manufactured, and installed the machine. The manufacturer filed a motion to dismiss and for summary judgment, arguing that the worker's action was barred by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-50(6) because it was not brought within six years of the date the machine was sold to the employer. The trial court granted the motion. The appellate court reversed, holding that &sect; 1-50(6) was unconstitutional on its face. The court modified and affirmed, holding that the statute was not applicable to the worker's cause of action and that he lacked standing to attack its constitutionality. The court noted that &sect; 1-50(6), the statute of repose for products liability claims, had to be read with the statute of limitations for personal injury actions. The court determined that the worker's cause of action accrued at the time he was injured, that his claim was still viable on the effective date of &sect; 1-50(6), and that &sect; 1-50(6) did not apply to actions that were pending on the effective date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On appeal by defendant as a matter of right from the judgments of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Walker, Judge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, entered at the 25 August 1980 Criminal Session, Guilford Superior Court.  Defendant was charged in indictments, proper in form, with the first degree murders of Freddie Pachaco and Tommy Ausley.  Upon defendant's motion, the cases were joined for trial.  The jury returned verdicts of guilty and recommended the sentence of death in each case.  The trial court ordered the imposition of the death penalty for both killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In relevant part, the evidence for the State tended to show the following.  On 16 October 1979, defendant, a nineteen year old white male, was walking on Merritt Drive in Greensboro with his friend Jimmy Eanes when he happened to meet Freddie Pachaco.  Defendant did not like Pachaco because he had been friendly with a girl defendant liked and had, without proper entitlement, worn the personal insignia (&quot;colors&quot;) of a motorcycle gang on his jacket.  On this occasion, defendant told Eanes that he &quot;hated that punk&quot; (Pachaco) and wanted to fight him right then and there.  This did not occur, however, because Pachaco was conciliatory and offered defendant some marijuana.  The group then&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  went to a trailer where they smoked marijuana and drank beer.  Sometime later, Pachaco asked defendant outright whether he was &quot;after&quot; him.  Defendant replied that he was not and further said that &quot;if [he] was going to kick [Pachaco's] ass, [he] would have already done it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the following day starting at about noon, several people began to congregate at the trailer, where defendant apparently lived, to drink beer and listen to music.  The merrymakers included Jimmy Eanes, Shawn Feeney, Keith Way, Billy Stanley and Leslie Hearl (who later married Stanley before trial).  Pachaco and his friend Tommy Ausley also unexpectedly joined the party and bought two cases of beer.  Everybody was calm and pleasant and seemed to be having a good time.  However, defendant told several of his friends during the course of the party that he disliked, or didn't have &quot;much use for&quot;, Pachaco and said he would like to kill him.  Later in the evening, defendant took Feeney's shotgun and fired it at the clothesline three times.  A deputy sheriff came to the trailer to investigate the disturbance, but he soon departed after talking to defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon defendant's suggestion, everyone decided to leave&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the trailer and go to the Stroker Motorcycle Clubhouse, which was located in some woods near Wendover Avenue in Greensboro.  Defendant had reasoned that they could make as much noise as they wanted to out there and get more beer besides.  [It was approximately 10:00 p.m.] While everyone prepared to move, defendant quickly slipped out to a nearby trailer where he borrowed a shotgun.  He returned with the gun and told Eanes to ride with Pachaco and Ausley to make sure they got to the clubhouse.  The entire party then proceeded to the rendezvous in various vehicles, caravan style.  En route, defendant retained the shotgun and told his companions that he was going to kill Pachaco and Ausley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the group arrived at the clubhouse, defendant opened the door while he continued to hold the shotgun.  Once inside, the members of the party played games, drank beer and listened to music.  Billy Stanley and Leslie Hearl left the company and went into an adjacent room to have sexual intercourse.  While everyone else engaged in these various recreational activities, defendant sat silently behind the bar with the shotgun in his lap.  Sometime later, defendant gave his knife to Eanes and instructed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  him to cut Pachaco's jugular vein and promised to back him up with the shotgun.  Eanes attacked Pachaco but only succeeded in cutting him on the throat.  Pachaco became emotional at this point but did not fight back.  Ausley attempted to help Pachaco and was confronted by Eanes who threw a chair at him.  At this point in the evening's events, the testimony of the eyewitnesses differed somewhat.  Nevertheless, the overall weight of that testimony combined with the evidence of defendant's own pre-trial statements to law officers tended to show the following occurrences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately after the throat-slashing incident between Eanes and Pachaco, defendant raised the shotgun and pointed it at Pachaco.  Pachaco told defendant, &quot;I will go down laughing.&quot; Without saying a word, defendant shot him in the chest.  Defendant then turned toward Ausley, whom he had never seen before that day.  Ausley pleaded with defendant and said, &quot;don't shoot me,&quot; &quot;[n]o, not me.&quot; Defendant shot him anyway.  Pachaco was still moaning.  Defendant walked over to where he lay helpless on the floor and shot him again at point blank range just below the heart.  Pachaco and Ausley died from the gunshot wounds.  During&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the shootings, defendant had &quot;a sort of grin&quot; on his face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, apparently with a full realization of what he had just done, walked outside to the porch of the clubhouse and told Feeney and Way that he had &quot;blown away&quot; two dudes.  He then directed everyone to help him dispose of the bodies.  The bodies were placed in an automobile which Eanes drove to Causey Street and abandoned in a ditch.  Defendant did not return to his residence; instead, he went home with Stanley and Hearl.  On the way, he told Stanley that he had killed Pachaco and Ausley because he &quot;didn't have any use for people like that.&quot; Defendant was not upset and seemed to have no regrets about the murders.  He went to sleep.  The next day, Stanley and Hearl returned to the clubhouse at defendant's behest and cleaned up the blood on the floor.  Another member of the Stroker motorcycle gang painted the steps to conceal bloodstains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bloody car and bodies of Pachaco and Ausley were discovered in the early morning hours of 19 October 1979.  Defendant took a bus to California where he was subsequently arrested on 28 January 1980.  Defendant waived extradition on 4 February 1980 and was picked up by two officers&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Greensboro Police Department two days later.  During the flight back to North Carolina, defendant made a full confession to the murders.  [He was advised of his constitutional rights and executed the required waiver form.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant presented no independent evidence during the guilt determination phase of the proceedings.  The defense did, however, elicit evidence during cross-examination of prosecution witnesses tending to show that defendant was drunk when the killings occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found defendant guilty of two counts of first-degree murder.  The State relied on its evidence presented during the guilt phase of the trial and did not offer additional evidence during the sentencing hearing.  The State did, however, argue that the murders were especially heinous because defendant committed them for sport and amusement.  In addition, the State contended that the killing of the eighteen-year-old Ausley was particularly despicable because defendant had shot him in cold blood as he begged and pleaded for his life.  On the other hand, defendant offered much evidence in mitigation of his criminal acts, including the following facts: his youth; the divorce of his parents during&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his childhood; his chronic drug and alcohol abuse since the age of twelve; his leaving home at the age of thirteen (from that time on, he had lived on his own); his low intelligence; his psychological problems of depression, conflicts in relationships and poor judgment; and his feelings of remorse over the killing of Ausley.  In its instructions upon the sentencing phase of the case, the court submitted two aggravating circumstances for the jury's consideration: (1) the murders were especially heinous, atrocious or cruel, G.S. 15A-2000(e)(9); and (2) each murder was part of a course of conduct in which defendant committed a crime of violence against another person, G.S. 15A-2000(e)(11).  The court also submitted ten mitigating circumstances to the jury.  The jury subsequently found one or more of the mitigating factors but also unanimously found them to be outweighed by the foregoing aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt.  The jury therefore recommended imposition of the death penalty for both murders, and the court so ordered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additional facts, which become relevant to defendant's specific assignments of error, shall be incorporated into the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Buncombe County, N.C., Ordinance No. 16401, which he was charged with violating. The ordinance prohibited operation of a junkyard or automobile graveyard within specified distances from public roads or schools, or within a residential area. The ordinance provided an exception if the junkyard or automobile graveyard was entirely surrounded by a fence or vegetation of sufficient height and density to prevent the contents of the yard from being visible from any public road or residence. Defendant argued that the ordinance violated N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Reversing past decisions holding that aesthetic considerations alone could not support a valid exercise of police power, the court held that aesthetic considerations may indeed provide a valid basis for the exercise of police power depending on the facts and circumstances of each case. The court also rejected the argument that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. In its view, when read contextually the ordinance apprised persons of ordinary intelligence who desired to know the law and abide by it what it required. The court affirmed the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the court of appeals' decision and held that the ordinance in the instant case did not violate the North Carolina Constitution or the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Nor was the language of the ordinance unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant was charged by bill of indictment, proper in form, with first-degree murder.  Upon his plea of not guilty, a jury was impaneled as required in a capital case.  The jury found the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree.  During the sentencing phase of the trial, the State submitted as an aggravating circumstance that the murder was heinous, atrocious and cruel.  The jury found that the aggravating circumstance was present but was insufficient to call for the death penalty.

In particular, the court held that the trial court had properly admitted defendant's confession because ample evidence was presented to support the finding that defendant was not taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way until after he had confessed to the murder in question. The court reasoned that because defendant voluntarily appeared at the police station and was allowed to come and go as he wished, and in fact had done so, he was not considered in custody. Additionally, the court found that the trial court properly declined to instruct the jury on the possible verdict of felony murder in the second degree because no such offense was recognized under state law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendants, employer American &amp; Efird Mills and insurance carrier Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Insurance Company, from the decision of the North Carolina Court of Appeals (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Clark, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Martin (Robert M.)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Arnold, JJ.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, concurring) reported at 51 N.C. App. 480, 277 S.E. 2d 83 (1981).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Industrial Commission's award denying benefits to employee-claimant for permanent and total disability under G.S. 97-29 and limiting the recovery of medical expenses to 300 weeks was remanded by the Court of Appeals for findings consistent with the evidence that the employee was entitled to an award under G.S. 97-29 and to lifetime medical expenses under G.S. 97-29 dating from the date when the uncontradicted evidence indicated that he became permanently and totally incapacitated.  This Court denied discretionary review on 6 October 1981.  The defendants filed petition for rehearing, alleging that this Court had neglected to consider the far-reaching consequences of the decision of the Court of Appeals.  Recognizing that this case does present a question of first impression in this State, we elected to entertain defendants' appeal and allowed defendants' petition for discretionary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  review on 15 December 1981.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case presents no factual disputes.  The claimant worked in the employer's cotton mill for some years prior to 1968 and had had some respiratory problems before that date.  In 1968 he was forced to quit his job at the mill due to breathing difficulties.  Although he obtained other sedentary employment, his average weekly wages began to decline in 1970 and continued to decline until 1973.  Complainant had no earnings for the fourth quarter of 1973, nor for the years 1974, 1975, and 1976.  He again had some earnings during each quarter of 1977 but has reported no earnings since the end of 1977.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith filed a claim for Workers' Compensation benefits on 8 June 1978.  He was examined on 15 September 1978 and determined by Dr. Douglas Kelling to be permanently and totally disabled.  The complainant was awarded compensation for 300 weeks dating from 1 January 1970 (the point in time when his average weekly wage shows its first decline) and $ 8,500 for permanent, irreversible injury to both lungs in an opinion and award filed by Deputy Commissioner Dianne C. Sellers on 4 January 1980.  He was also awarded all medical expenses arising out of his occupational&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants appealed from the opinion and award of the Deputy Commissioner to the full Commission.  The Commission filed an opinion and award on 3 April 1980 by Commissioner Brown (Commissioner Stephenson, concurring; Commissioner Vance, dissenting) limiting the plaintiff's compensation to 300 weeks beginning 1 January 1970 and limiting the award of medical expenses to the same 300-week period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff appealed pursuant to G.S. 97-86.1 which permits an appeal of a portion of the Commission's award.  Accordingly, the Commission ordered a lump sum payment of the partial disability compensation, defendants not having appealed that portion of the award.  Thus, the only issues before the Court of Appeals were (1) whether the Industrial Commission erred in denying to plaintiff an award under G.S. 97-29 for permanent total disability and (2) whether the Commission erred in limiting plaintiff's recovery of medical expenses to 300 weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals dismissed plaintiff's appeal for failure to file within 30 days from the date of the full Commission's opinion and award; however, because of the significance of the issues in the appeal, the Court of Appeals issued a writ&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of certiorari under Appellate Rule 21(a) to review the issues presented by plaintiff.  In an opinion by Judge Clark, the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the Industrial Commission for a finding in accordance with all the evidence that plaintiff was permanently and totally disabled in 1978 and for entry of an award of disability compensation under G.S. 97-29 as it existed in 1978 when plaintiff became permanently and totally disabled.  The Court of Appeals also held that plaintiff was entitled to medical expenses under G.S. 97-29 for the remainder of plaintiff's life dating from the date of permanent and total disability.  We granted discretionary review to review the decision of the Court of Appeals.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, employer and insurance carrier, sought review of a decision of the North Carolina Court of Appeals, which remanded the workers' compensation case for a finding and award in accordance with all the evidence that plaintiff employee was permanently and totally disabled in 1978. Otherwise, the appellate court affirmed the awards of permanent partial compensation and medical expenses to the employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court ordered an award of disability compensation to the employee under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 97-29, as the statute existed in 1978 when the employee became permanently and totally disabled. On review, the court modified and affirmed the appellate court's decision. The court explained that, although the employee suffered diminished earning capacity as a result of occupational disease as early as 1970, no right to recover for permanent total disability vested until after the enactment of the 1978 version of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 97-29. Because no possible liability accrued to defendants until after the effective date of the statutory revision, the appellate court's application of the 1978 version of &sect; 97-29 did not constitute an unconstitutional retroactive application of substantive law. The court further concluded that the employee was entitled to medical expenses beginning in 1970 when his partial disability began and extending so long as the treatment provided &quot;needed relief,&quot; as contemplated by the provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 97-29. Thus, an award of medical expenses to the employee relating to his permanent partial award was improperly limited to 300 weeks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the appellate court's decision to delete the 300-week limitation for medical expenses in conjunction with permanent partial compensation awarded to the employee. The court otherwise affirmed the appellate court's decision, which remanded the case for entry of an award of compensation for the employee's permanent total disability beginning in 1978.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff successfully filed a motion to vacate the judgment. Defendant filed motions to strike the order vacating the default judgment and to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction. The trial court denied the motion.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged in a bill of indictment with the offense of common law robbery.  In pertinent part, the evidence for the State tended to show that defendant snatched fifty dollars from the hand of James Blue who was walking on a street in Raleigh on 22 September 1980.

Defendant again appealed, noting that robbery and larceny from the person had the same penalty. The court affirmed the appellate court, stating that defendant was properly informed of the accusation against him by an indictment that charged an offense containing all the elements of another offense. Defendant therefore suffered no impairment of due process. The court noted that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-170 referred to both lesser offenses and included offenses. An included offense was one whose elements were also charged by an indictment's averments, the court continued. There was no requirement under &sect; 15-170 that an included offense or an offense of a lesser degree carry a penalty less than that of the offense of a greater degree charged in an indictment, the court found.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Harnett County Superior Court (North Carolina), which found her guilty of accessory before the fact to murder in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-5 (1969) and given the mandatory life sentence pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-6 (Cum. Supp. 1979). Defendant maintained that a portion of the statute under which she was convicted, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-5 (repealed 1981), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a resident of Virginia, arranged to have her sister and nephew murder her husband. The murder actually occurred in North Carolina, but defendant made the arrangements to hire her sister and nephew and otherwise commanded the event from Virginia. Defendant contended that the portion of &sect; 14-5 in question was unconstitutional because it purported to assert jurisdiction over actions which occurred outside the State of North Carolina in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VI. Affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that the portion of the statute at issue represented a constitutional assertion of jurisdiction. As long as the principal felony occurred in North Carolina, the courts of that state could assert jurisdiction over one charged with being an accessory before the fact to that felony because it had a legitimate, peculiar interest in punishing the accessorial offense and there was a sufficient territorial relationship between defendant's acts and the State of North Carolina. The Sixth Amendment was not a prohibition to the exercise of the court's jurisdiction. Finally, the court found that defendant received a fair trial that was free from prejudicial error.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the appellate judgment reversing the trial court' s denial of the motion for summary judgment. The court held that the state legislature only authorized the Board of Governors to license degree conferrals, not teaching, and that the Board of Governors' proffered interpretation of &sect; 116-15 would unconstitutionally burden academic freedom and freedom of speech in violation of U.S. Const. amend.

The court determined that this power was something that traditionally was within the power of the governor and that a legislative provision that altered this power was an unconstitutional delegation of power to the legislature. The second provision gave the same committee of state legislators the power over actions proposed by the governor with respect to the administration and use of federal block grant funds.

B., Jr.), J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, entered 16 February 1981 in Alamance District Court, allowing respondent's motion to suppress fingerprint evidence and dismiss four juvenile petitions alleging the felonious offenses of kidnapping, rape, armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mario Lopez Stedman was born 16 February 1963 and was fifteen years, nine months and seventeen days of age on 3 December 1978, the date of the alleged offenses set forth in the juvenile petitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four petitions alleged that Mario Lopez Stedman was a delinquent child as defined by G.S. 7A-278(2), now G.S. 7A-517(12), by reason of having committed the following offenses: (1) the kidnapping of Karen Farris on or about 3 December 1978, in violation of G.S. 14-39; (2) armed robbery of Karen Farris on the same day in violation of G.S. 14-87; (3) first degree rape of Karen Farris on the same day in violation of former G.S. 14-21; and (4) felonious assault on Karen Farris on the same day in violation of G.S. 14-32(a), by shooting her four times with a .25 caliber pistol with the intent to kill inflicting serious bodily injury. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The State's evidence at the hearing before Judge Allen tends to show the matters narrated in the following numbered paragraphs:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Karen Farris was a nineteen-year-old desk clerk at the Village Inn Motel in Graham, North Carolina.  On 3 December 1978, she worked the second shift.  At approximately 9 p.m. two black males entered the Village Inn Motel lobby, indicated they were having car trouble and asked to use the telephone.  Don King, an employee at the motel, gave them a telephone number of a wrecker service to call for assistance.  The two men left and returned at approximately 9:30 p.m. when Karen Farris was alone behind the counter in the motel lobby near the cash register.  One of the men, whom she now recognizes as Kelvin Sellars, pointed a pistol at her and demanded the money from the cash register.  At his direction she removed about $ 200 in cash and gave it to the robber.  The other man picked up a grey metal box underneath the counter near the cash register, opened it but found nothing to take.  This second man did not say anything and she did not see him touch anything except the metal box.  Karen Farris has not been able to identify the second man, but described him&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as a tall, slender black male with short hair and medium skin color consistent with the appearance of Mario Lopez Stedman.  She said he was &quot;young, he was real jumpy and kind of hyperactive about the whole thing, he thought it was a game.  He was right much younger than Sellars was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. When the robbers left, they forced Karen Farris to accompany them in their vehicle.  They took her to a remote area of Alamance County about twelve miles from the Village Inn Motel, raped her, and shot her at close range with a .25 caliber pistol.  After shooting her twice, the men started to leave but discovered she was still alive.  As she begged for her life, they shot her twice more, once in the face.  They left her for dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. SBI Agent Sam Pennica went to the Village Inn Motel that evening and also drove to a location on a dirt road off Highway No. 62 approximately twelve miles from the Village Inn Motel.  On that dirt road at the point indicated he found a small red wallet with identification bearing the name of Karen Farris and found certain other items, including a white slip and a bra.  At the Village Inn Motel, Agent Pennica obtained latent fingerprint impressions from various areas of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the lobby, counter and cash register.  He took four latent fingerprint impressions from the above described grey metal box.  Thereafter, SBI Agent Pennica located a 1963 blue Plymouth car parked in Yanceyville, North Carolina.  Highway No. 62 runs directly into Yanceyville from the area of the rape scene.  On 12 July 1979, Karen Farris identified this 1963 Plymouth vehicle as the car in which she was raped.  SBI Agent Pennica obtained eighteen latent fingerprint impressions from the vehicle and delivered them to SBI Agent Layton for comparison purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. On 6 August 1979, when Mario Lopez Stedman was sixteen years, five months and twenty-one days old, he was indicted in Alamance Superior Court for kidnapping, armed robbery, first degree rape and felonious assault of Karen Farris.  Under those bills of indictment he was arrested on or about 14 September 1979 and fingerprinted pursuant to the procedures normally utilized for adults who are indicted by the grand jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. On 30 October 1979, Judge Donald L. Smith, presiding over Alamance Superior Court, quashed the bills of indictment &quot;for failure of the State to demonstrate that the superior court had proper jurisdiction over said&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  offenses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Stedman was detained under new juvenile petitions approved 30 October 1979 and filed 2 November 1979 alleging the same offenses contained in the bills of indictment.  These juvenile petitions were dismissed by District Judge Thomas D. Cooper on 19 November 1979 upon a finding that the fingerprint evidence had been illegally obtained due to the fact that Stedman was fifteen years of age at the time the alleged crimes were committed.  Therefore, due to Stedman's age, Judge Cooper found he was illegally fingerprinted pursuant to bills of indictment issuing out of the superior court &quot;without fulfilling the requirements of [former] G.S. 7A-280 and G.S. 15A-502.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. On 26 February 1980, Judge Thomas D. Cooper issued a nontestimonial identification order pursuant to G.S. 7A-596, which had been enacted as part of the North Carolina Juvenile Code effective 1 January 1980, requiring the fingerprinting and palm printing of Mario Lopez Stedman.  When the order was served on Stedman, he fled the state and was eventually returned to North Carolina from Washington, D.C. on 14 January 1981 to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for failure to comply with Judge Cooper's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. On 9 February 1981, Superior Court Judge McLelland issued a second nontestimonial identification order as authorized by G.S. 7A-596 and pursuant to that order the fingerprints of Mario Lopez Stedman were taken on 12 February 1981 by SBI Agent Pennica in the presence of Stedman's attorney.  These prints were delivered to SBI Agent Layton for comparison with the latent prints taken from the metal box at the Village Inn Motel and the latent prints taken from the 1963 Plymouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. When SBI Agent Layton compared the latent fingerprints taken from the metal box and from the 1963 Plymouth automobile with the inked fingerprint impressions of Mario Lopez Stedman taken by SBI Agent Pennica pursuant to the non-testimonial identification order of Judge McLelland, it was the opinion of Agent Layton that one of the prints lifted from the metal box was the right thumbprint of Stedman and that six of the prints lifted from the 1963 Plymouth were prints of Mario Lopez Stedman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four juvenile petitions were refiled and came on for hearing before Judge Allen at the 16 February 1981 Juvenile Session of Alamance District Court.  The State requested that the proceedings be treated as a probable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  cause hearing on the felony petitions and that Mario Lopez Stedman be bound over, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">i.e.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that the charges be transferred, to the Superior Court of Alamance for trial as in case of adults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stedman objected to the admission of the latent fingerprint impressions lifted from the grey metal box at the scene of the crime and lifted from the 1963 Plymouth and the comparison of same with his inked fingerprints taken by authority of the nontestimonial identification order issued by Judge McLelland on 9 February 1981.  The motion to suppress such evidence was allowed.  Judge Allen thereupon dismissed the petitions on the ground that the remainder of the evidence offered by the State was insufficient to support a finding of probable cause or to permit the charges to be transferred to the superior court for disposition as in case of adults.  The State gave notice of appeal in open court and later petitioned this Court for certiorari to review that order.  We allowed the petition, thus bypassing the Court of Appeals.  The questions involved are now before this Court for initial appellate review.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State filed a petition for certiorari to review the order from the Juvenile Session of the Alamance District Court (North Carolina), which granted the motion of juvenile offender to suppress the evidence of latent fingerprint impressions, and dismissed for lack of probable cause the four juvenile petitions of the State, and denied permission to transfer the charges to the Superior Court for disposition as in case of adults.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lower court's order granted the juvenile defendant's motion to suppress fingerprint evidence and dismissed four juvenile petitions alleging the felonious offenses of kidnapping, rape, armed robbery, and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury. On appeal, the court determined that the lower court erred in suppressing the evidence on the doctrine of &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree.&quot; The court held that the fact that the fingerprints could not legally have been taken at the time of the offense did not preclude their later admission in the case. The court found that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 15A-502(c) and 7a-596 were procedural statutes and that a change in the evidentiary or procedural law between the time of the offense and the time of the trial did not prevent the State from utilizing the procedure even though at the time of the offense it was unavailable. The court determined that it discerned no unconstitutional ex post facto ramifications, holding that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-596 authorizing the fingerprinting of minors on a nontestimonial identification order did not deprive juvenile defendant of any defenses previously available under the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the order of the lower court, and remanded for trial as in case of adults.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband sought to be declared the sole beneficial owner of certain residential real estate. The deed to the realty was made to both parties as husband and wife, but it was undisputed that the husband furnished the entire purchase price from his separate estate. The principal question presented was whether the evidentiary showing before the trial court entitled the wife to summary judgment. The trial court held that it did, and the appellate court affirmed that decision. The court disagreed and reversed. The court held that anytime either a husband or wife contributed towards the purchase of the entireties property their contribution was presumed to be a gift to the other. The presumption of a gift and resulting trust in transactions applied in all such cases not governed by the Equitable Distribution Act. The court reasoned that the husband was no longer necessarily the sole provider, and it was likely that both spouses contributed to the goods and furnishings of the household. Anytime either a husband or wife contributed towards the purchase of entireties property their contribution was presumed to be a gift to the other.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 18 February 1981, pursuant to leave granted by the Attorney General, plaintiffs Wallace and Howells instituted an action in the nature of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">quo warranto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against defendants Bone and Nash, members of the North Carolina House of Representatives, challenging the legality of their serving as members of the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission (EMC).  On the same day, plaintiffs Barkalow and Armstrong instituted an action against defendants Bone and Nash, and also defendants Harrington and Thomas, the latter two being members of the North Carolina Senate, challenging the legality of defendants serving on the EMC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gist of the complaints is that the service of defendants on the EMC at the same time they are serving as members of the General Assembly violates the Separation of Powers clause of the North Carolina Constitution.  Plaintiffs allege that Section 6 of Chapter 1158 of the 1979 Session Laws (Second Session) [codified as G.S. 143B-283(d)] is unconstitutional.  This section increases the membership of the EMC by four and provides that two of the additional members shall&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be members of the House of Representatives appointed by the Speaker of the House, and that the other two shall be members of the Senate appointed by the President of the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants filed answers in which they admitted most of the allegations of the complaints.  However, they denied that the act of the General Assembly complained of is unconstitutional and that their service on the EMC is invalid.  They asked that the act be declared constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By consent of the parties, the actions were consolidated for trial and disposition.  On 13 March 1981 the parties agreed to a pre-trial order which contains the following undisputed facts:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">a. James C. Wallace is a citizen, resident, and taxpayer of Orange County, North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">b. David H. Howells is a citizen, resident and taxpayer of Wake County, North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">c. Frederick S. Barkalow is a citizen and resident of Wake County, North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">d. Brenda Armstrong is a citizen and resident of Durham County, North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">e. Wallace, Howells, Barkalow, and Armstrong are members of the Environmental Management Commission appointed by the Governor, pursuant to G.S. 143B-283(a).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">f. Roger W. Bone is a citizen and resident&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  of Nash County, North Carolina, and is an elected member of the North Carolina House of Representatives.  He is Vice Chairman of the House Committee on Water and Air Resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">g. Robie Nash is a citizen and resident of Rowan County, North Carolina, and is an elected member of the North Carolina House of Representatives.  He serves on both the Water and Air Resources and Energy Committees of the House.</SPAN></P>

Representatives Bone and Nash are members of the Environmental Management Commission appointed by the Speaker of the House on February 11, 1981, and inducted into office&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  on February 12, 1981, pursuant to G.S. 143B-283(d)(1).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">l. The Environmental Management Commission is a quasi-independent regulatory agency of the State with quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial powers and duties as enumerated in G.S. 143B-282.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">m. Members of the Environmental Management Commission are public officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">n. The provision pursuant to which Senators Harrington and Thomas and Representatives Bone and Nash were appointed [G.S. 143B-283(d)] was enacted by the General Assembly in June 1980 as Section 6 of Chapter 1158 of the 1979 Session Laws (2nd Session 1980).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">o. Prior to the enactment of G.S. 143B-243(d), the Environmental Management Commission consisted of thirteen (13) members appointed by the Governor.  After the enactment of G.S. 143B-243(d), the Environmental Management Commission consists of seventeen (17) members of which thirteen (13) are appointed by the Governor, two (2) are appointed by the Speaker of the House from the membership of the House, and two (2) are appointed by the President of the Senate (Lieutenant Governor) from the membership of the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the pre-trial order the parties also agreed that the contested issue to be determined by the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  court is<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Whether the provisions of G.S. 143B-243(d) [1979 S.L., Ch. 1158, &sect; 6 (2nd Session, 1981)], by which two representatives and two senators were appointed to membership on the Environmental Management Commission, violate the separation of powers provision of the Constitution of North Carolina (N.C. Const., Art. I, &sect; 6).</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following a hearing at which Judge Bailey considered the pleadings, the stipulations, briefs filed by all parties, and arguments of counsel, he entered a judgment in which he found facts substantially as stipulated by the parties.  He concluded as a matter of law, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the following:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">5. The legislative members of the Environmental Management Commission (defendants) are in a clear minority position on the Commission.  The statutory composition of the Commission does not represent an attempt by the General Assembly to usurp the functions of the executive branch of State government, but represents a cooperative effort between the executive and legislative branches.  This court wishes to make it clear that the clear minority position of the legislators on the Commission is a critical factor in the court's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">6. Under the circumstances&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  presented in this case, individual members of the legislature may serve on the Environmental Management Commission, without violating the separation of powers provision in Article I, &sect; 6 of the Constitution of North Carolina, where such service falls in the realm of cooperation on the part of the legislature and there is no evidence of an attempt to usurp functions of the executive branch of our State government.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Bailey also concluded that the challenged statute is constitutional.  He further concluded that plaintiffs are not entitled to the relief sought and dismissed the actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs appealed and defendants petitioned this court for discretionary review prior to determination in the Court of Appeals.  Defendants contended that the appeal has significant public interest and that the legal principle involved in these cases is of major significance to the jurisprudence of the state.  Plaintiffs joined in the request that we bypass the Court of Appeals.  This court allowed the petition on 2 June 1981.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Reversed.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff citizens challenged the decision of the Wake Superior Court (North Carolina), which held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 143B-283(d), which provided for the appointment of four members of the General Assembly to the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission (EMC), was constitutional. The citizens and defendant legislative members of the EMC requested that the court bypass the appellate court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The EMC was created by statute with the power and duty to promulgate rules and regulations governing the protection, preservation, and enhancement of the state's water and air resources. The General Assembly increased the EMC's membership by four and provided that two of the four should be members of the North Carolina House of Representatives appointed by the Speaker of the House and that the other two should be members of the North Carolina Senate appointed by the President of the Senate. The citizens argued that the service of the four legislative members violated the separation of powers clause, N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, which adopted the principle of separation of powers between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Finding that the duties of the EMC were administrative or executive in character and had no relation to the function of the legislative branch, the court held that the statute was unconstitutional. The legislature could not constitutionally create a special instrumentality of government to implement specific legislation and then retain some control over the implementation by appointing legislators to the governing body of the instrumentality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the superior court's decision and held that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our primary consideration on this appeal is whether an attorney subject to disciplinary action under Chapter 84 of the North Carolina General Statutes is entitled to trial by jury under Article I, &sect; 25 of the North Carolina Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The North Carolina State Bar instituted a disciplinary action alleging that the attorney procured false testimony in a civil action and that such conduct violated the Disciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility. A hearing was held before a committee of the commission, which found that the bar had established the charge of procuring false testimony by the greater weight of the evidence, held the attorney in violation of the disciplinary rules, and suspended the attorney's license for six months. The court of appeals affirmed and held that due process did not require that an attorney was entitled to a jury trial in a statutory disciplinary or disbarment proceeding. On appeal, the court affirmed, with modification, the decision of the court of appeals. The court held that: (1) the North Carolina Constitution did not entitle an attorney to a jury trial in a statutory disciplinary or disbarment proceeding; (2) the appropriate standard for review of a decision of the commission was the &quot;whole record&quot; test set out in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), N.C.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Seay, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 4 February 1980 Session of Cabarrus Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged in bills of indictment, proper in form, with the first-degree murder and armed robbery of Susan Verle Pierce.  At the guilt determination phase of the trial, the State offered evidence tending to show that Susan Verle Pierce was working as a clerk at the Seven-Eleven convenience store operated by the Southland Corporation on North Church Street in Concord, North Carolina on the 11:00 p.m., 2 June 1979, to 7:00 a.m., 3 June 1979, shift.  She was seen alive at 6:00 a.m. on 3 June 1979 by a customer who returned to the store a short time later and found her lying on the floor with a wound at the base of her neck.  Police, medical personnel, and officials of the Southland Corporation were summoned to the scene where it was ascertained that Mrs. Pierce was dead and that $ 67.27 was missing from the store's cash register.  It was later determined that Mrs. Pierce's death was caused by a shotgun blast to her neck and that the shotgun was fired from three to nine feet away.  Southland Corporation and its management personnel offered a $ 5,000 reward for information leading to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the conviction of Mrs. Pierce's killer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Linda Massey, defendant's girlfriend, testified that in the late morning of Saturday, 2 June 1979, she began to smoke marijuana and drink beer, wine, and vodka.  Later on that day, she exchanged her Pinto automobile with Robert Brown so that she, defendant, and her fourteen-year-old nephew, Darryl Brawley, could ride around in Brown's Oldsmobile.  The three of them left the witness's apartment in Charlotte in the early afternoon, and after stopping at a couple of taverns and an acquaintance's apartment, they picked up a man who throughout her testimony the witness referred to as the &quot;dude.&quot; They continued to drink and smoke marijuana as they rode around.  On the way to and in Gastonia, they stopped at several service stations and convenience stores, and upon returning to the automobile at each store the witness would report whether it was crowded or not.  At one station they stopped at in Gastonia, defendant and the &quot;dude&quot; entered the station and the witness, who had remained in the automobile on this occasion, heard a sound like a backfire.  After leaving this station, the witness assumed a position in the back seat and the man she identified&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as the &quot;dude&quot; began driving.  She was &quot;high&quot; on alcohol and marijuana and dozed intermittently as they proceeded to Concord.  In Concord they stopped at another store, and defendant and the unidentified &quot;dude&quot; went into the store.  Shortly thereafter, defendant returned to the automobile and carried what appeared to the witness to be a shotgun into the store.  She then heard a noise that sounded like an automobile crashing into a building and observed the female attendant in the store grab her chest near her left shoulder.  Defendant then returned to the automobile, and they proceeded to the witness's apartment in Charlotte.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness testified on cross-examination that when she was first taken to jail in Gastonia, she was told by the police that her children would be taken away from her and that she would be the first woman in the country to die in the gas chamber unless she agreed with what they said and cooperated with them.  The witness admitted that she had given five different stories about the happenings on 2 and 3 June 1979 for the reasons that she was scared and she did not want defendant to be involved because she loved him.  She stated that as a result of plea bargain&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  charges against her were reduced from first-degree murder and armed robbery to accessory after the fact of these crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darryl Brawley, after plea bargaining for a reduction of the charges against him from first-degree murder and armed robbery to accessory after the fact to these crimes, testified to facts which were essentially the same as those testified to by the witness Massey.  In addition, he identified the third man in the automobile as &quot;Danny Brown&quot; and pointed him out in the courtroom as co-defendant Riley Edward Devore.  He further stated that after picking up &quot;Danny Brown,&quot; defendant put a shotgun shell in the shotgun and said, &quot;Let's go to Concord or Gastonia and make some money.&quot; He testified that he saw defendant and &quot;Danny Brown&quot; run into a service station booth, tackle the attendant, remove money from the cash register, and heard the gun go off while it was pointed at the attendant.  He did not testify as to the events surrounding the killing of Mrs. Pierce and the robbery of the Seven-Eleven convenience store.  Other testimony indicated that he had previously told police officers investigating the killing of Mrs. Pierce that defendant had shot a woman in the chest&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with a .20 gauge sawed-off shotgun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State also offered the testimony of Evelyn Kindley, who testified that at about 6:10 a.m. on 3 June 1979 she passed the Seven-Eleven store on North Church Street in Concord and saw a black male aged sixteen to twenty-five years old sitting on the passenger seat of an automobile in the store's parking lot with his feet on the ground.  He was slumped forward as if he were tying his shoes or fumbling with his legs.  She also observed that the attendant in the store was standing behind the counter and appeared to be looking at something in the back of the store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was evidence which tended to show that one of defendant's fingerprints was found on the inside of the rear passenger side window of Robert Brown's Oldsmobile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant testified that on Saturday, 2 June 1979, after visiting with his mother in Charlotte, North Carolina, he went to his sister's house in Charlotte where he remained until night.  His sister then carried him to his wife's house in Charlotte where he spent the night with his wife and his three sons.  He remained there until the afternoon of Sunday, 3 June 1979.  He stated that he did not see the witness Linda Massey until&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the afternoon of Sunday, 3 June 1979.  Defendant's sister, his wife, and his wife's sister offered testimony which tended to corroborate defendant's testimony regarding his whereabouts on Saturday, 2 June 1979, and Sunday morning, 3 June 1979.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On rebuttal the State offered the testimony of Detective Douglas Rivelle of the Gastonia Police Department who stated that defendant told him and other police officers that on the night of 2 June 1979 and the morning of 3 June 1979 he was with Linda Massey and a fourteen-year-old boy smoking marijuana and drinking wine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict of guilty of first-degree murder on the theory of felony murder and a verdict of guilty of robbery with a firearm.  The conviction for armed robbery was arrested since it was the underlying felony upon which the felony murder conviction was based.  Co-defendant Riley Edward Devore was found not guilty on all charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 15A-2000(a)(1), the court proceeded to conduct the sentencing phase to determine whether defendant should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment.  The State again presented evidence concerning the robbery and killing of the service station attendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in Gastonia.  Defendant offered evidence of his good behavior while incarcerated in Cabarrus County Jail, and a stipulation was entered showing that defendant's intelligence quotient was sixty-nine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the evidence on the sentencing proceeding, the trial court instructed the jury on the sentencing phase.  Three aggravating circumstances were submitted to the jury: (1) whether the murder was committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing lawful arrest; (2) whether the murder was committed for pecuniary gain; and (3) whether the murder was part of a course of conduct in which Larry Darnell Williams engaged and did that course of conduct include the commission by the defendant of other crimes of violence against other persons?  Seven mitigating circumstances were submitted to the jury:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">(1) Larry Darnell Williams has no significant history of prior criminal activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">(2) That Larry Williams was gainfully employed when the murder occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">(3) That Larry Williams voluntarily admitted himself to Open House in Charlotte for rehabilitation for drug problems in October 1975 and January and February of 1976.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">(4) That Larry Williams has an intelligence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  quotient (IQ) of 69.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">(5) That Larry Williams was of good conduct while in the Cabarrus County jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">(6) That Larry Williams conducted himself in a normal business manner with Attorney Karl Adkins in a personal injury case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">(7) Any other circumstance or circumstances arising from the evidence which you the jury deem to have mitigating value.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found beyond a reasonable doubt each of the aggravating circumstances submitted.  The jury also found that the aggravating circumstances were sufficiently substantial to call for the imposition of the death penalty.  After finding one or more of the seven mitigating circumstances, although it did not designate which ones were found, the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances.  The jury then recommended that the death penalty be imposed, and the court entered judgment imposing the death penalty for the crime of first-degree felony murder.  Defendant appealed of right to this Court from the judgment imposed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of his conviction for murder and the subsequent imposition of the death penalty. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, but remanded for resentencing. The court explained that defendant was entitled to a new sentencing hearing when the death penalty was imposed on the basis of the aggravating circumstance that the murder was committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing lawful arrest under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(e)(4). The court observed that the state submitted the aggravating circumstance that the victim's murder was committed for the purpose of preventing arrest. The state argued defendant killed the victim to eliminate her as a witness who could identify the armed robbery perpetrators. The court explained that the isolated fact that a killing occurred during the commission of a felony was insufficient to justify the submission of aggravating circumstances. The court further noted that there must be evidence from which the jury could infer that at least one of the purposes which motivated the killing was the desire to avoid arrest, and such required additional evidence was lacking in the present case.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, several eyewitnesses saw defendant beating the victim and then saw the victim get into defendant's car. The eyewitnesses reported the incident along with the car's license plate number to police. The police were unable to find the car that day but found the victim's body the next day. The police traced the vehicle to a person who had loaned her car to defendant during the time at issue. Thereafter, police arrested defendant and found fresh blood stains on defendant's clothing and in the car. There was evidence that the victim remained alive somewhere between 2 and 24 hours after the injuries were inflicted. Defendant confessed after he was read his Miranda rights. The court affirmed the conviction and death sentence and held that defendant's confession was voluntary and that probable cause existed for a search warrant. The court also held that the North Carolina statute governing submission of aggravating circumstances in the penalty phase of a capital murder case, N.C. Gen.

The court held that the failure of the trial court to specifically name the felony in its charge to the jury constituted harmful prejudicial error. The court affirmed the remainder of the convictions, holding that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury findings. There was nothing in the record to indicate that the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion or prejudice. Defendant was not entitled to notice of the evidence, which the state intended to offer in support of and to prove aggravating circumstances. The court held that same jury should hear both phases of the trial. There was no error in the exclusion of expert testimony because of the failure of the party proffering the witness to qualify him as an expert.

The court held that (1) substantial evidence was introduced to support the reasonable inference that the victim died of a gunshot wound received during the course of an attempted armed robbery, making the felony murder conviction proper; (2) the evidence that defendant had committed prior armed robberies of drug stores tended to indicate his intent at the time of the occurrence at issue and therefore the evidence had not been wrongly admitted; (3) the removal of the victim to the back room had been an integral part of the attempted robbery and was insufficient to support a separate conviction for kidnapping; and (4) because the court was able to determine whether the death penalty would have been recommended absent inclusion of the charge of kidnapping as an aggravating circumstance, a new sentencing hearing was proper.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon entry of pleas of not guilty, defendants were tried upon bills of indictment, proper in form, which charged them with the first-degree murder of Donald B. Williamson.  At trial, the State presented evidence that tended to show that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the evening of 18 August 1979, defendants were in the company of several of their friends, including Cynthia Bass, a witness for the State.  Early in the evening of 18 August, Ms. Bass drove defendants from the home of a friend to a tavern on Highway 321 between Newton and Maiden.  After a short while, defendants gave Ms. Bass directions and instructed her to drive them to another destination.  At approximately one o'clock on the morning of 19 August, Ms. Bass drove her car into the driveway of the home of Donald B. Williamson located near Maiden, North Carolina.  The Williamson house was built of cement blocks.  Both defendants got out of the car, and Ms. Bass drove away without observing where the men went.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 1:16 a.m. a dispatcher&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at the Catawba County Sheriff's Department received a telephone call from a person identifying himself as the decedent, Donald B. Williamson.  The caller requested that he be allowed to talk with the Maiden Police Department.  Upon inquiry by the dispatcher, the person said he had been robbed of his pocketbook which contained the sum of $ 35.00.  As the caller described the robbery, he identified one of his assailants as being Bobby Swink. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before the conversation ended, the caller gave his name, address and telephone number, as well as a description of his house.  After the conversation ended at approximately 1:19 a.m., Deputy Sheriff Gary Sigmon was dispatched to the address.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Judy Gail Beal was decedent's daughter and testified for the State.  Ms. Beal testified that she and defendant Rinck had dated one another until approximately one week before her father's death.  Throughout that time, defendant Rinck had spent much time at decedent's home.  According to Ms. Beal, decedent referred to defendant Rinck as &quot;Swink.&quot; Decedent's granddaughter, Candy Frye, confirmed the practice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Sigmon arrived at the Williamson residence at 1:35 a.m. The officer went to the front&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  door and knocked several times but no one answered.  It appeared to the deputy that most of the lights were on in the house.  As he stood on the front porch of the house, the officer heard a noise at the rear of the dwelling that sounded like a door closing.  As he walked around the left side of the house, he saw a blue automobile parked at the rear of the house.  The back door of the house was open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Deputy Sigmon approached the vehicle, he saw an individual sitting in the driver's seat whom he subsequently identified as being defendant Rinck.  Upon being asked by the officer who had called the sheriff's department, defendant Rinck said &quot;Them in there.&quot; Defendant Rinck thereupon got out of the car and walked in front of it.  Thereafter, the officer saw another person standing at the threshold of the back door.  That individual was wearing faded blue jeans and no shirt, and he had shoulder length brown hair.  Officer Sigmon observed both individuals go back into the house.  As he stood at the car after the men had gone inside, he saw two rifles, one resting in the rear floorboard, the other lying on the backseat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deputy went back to his cruiser and radioed in the license tag&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  number of the automobile parked at the rear of the house.  The Communications Center ran a check upon the license number and informed the officer that it was registered in decedent's name.  The officer also requested that the dispatcher telephone the residence.  After calling the house, the dispatcher told the deputy that the line was busy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly thereafter, two policemen, Office Tom Hurley and Officer Steve Pruitt, from Maiden arrived.  The policemen went to the rear of the house, and Deputy Sigmon covered the front door.  Meanwhile, Lieutenant Gene Finger, Shift Commander of the Catawba County Sheriff's Department, arrived at the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lieutenant Finger and Deputy Sigmon entered the front door to find a telephone cord on the floor and numerous .22 caliber rifle cartridges strewn about the living room.  Some of the cartridges had been spent.  The men proceeded through the house to the bedroom to find decedent's body lying in the bed.  The body bore two bullet wounds about the face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the arrival of a detective, the lieutenant left the scene to return to the sheriff's office.  As he drove along, the officer noticed two individuals walking along the road approximately 200 feet&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from decedent's residence.  The lieutenant turned on his blue light and stopped the men.  The individuals were the defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lieutenant Don Burgess, a detective with the Catawba County Sheriff's Department, observed the blue light from the Williamson house, and Deputy Sigmon, as well as an agent of the State Bureau of Investigation, accompanied the detective to the place where the defendants had been stopped.  Lieutenant Burgess observed defendant McMurry placing his hand in a bulging pocket.  The detective ordered defendant McMurry to stop and to take his hand out of the pocket.  The defendant did as he was told, and Lieutenant Burgess reached into the pocket and retrieved a pill bottle which bore decedent's name.  Thereupon, the officers arrested defendants and proceeded to search them.  The subsequent search revealed, among other things, a set of keys.  The keys were those to the automobile parked at the rear of the Williamson residence which belonged to the decedent.  Subsequent investigation identified fingerprints found within the house as being those of the defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant McMurry did not offer any evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Rinck offered evidence, including his own testimony, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that tended to show that he and defendant McMurry had visited the Williamson home during the early morning hours of 19 August for the purpose of visiting decedent's son Jerry Beal, and decedent's daughter, Judy Beal, whom defendant Rinck had dated.  They knocked on the front door, but nobody answered.  The pair then proceeded to look around the outside premises.  Upon the arrival of Deputy Sigmon, the pair left.  Defendant Rinck denied that anyone ever called him &quot;Swink.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These proceedings were spawned by the insolvency of Reserve Insurance Company, an Illinois corporation doing business in North Carolina.  On 7 May 1979 Reserve was enjoined by the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois from doing business except with the consent of the Illinois Director of Insurance.  On 16 May 1979, the North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance ordered Reserve to cease writing new or renewal business in this State until its minimum maintained capital was restored.  Reserve was adjudicated insolvent, and the Illinois Director of Insurance was appointed &quot;Domiciliary Receiver&quot; on 29 May 1979, with powers to liquidate the business affairs of Reserve.  The North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance filed this action against Reserve on 31 May 1979 pursuant to the Uniform Insurers Liquidation Act which is codified as part of Article 17A of Chapter 58 of the General Statutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commissioner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  alleged the insolvency of the defendant company and sought appointment as receiver in North Carolina.  The Commissioner was appointed &quot;Ancillary Receiver,&quot; and a restraining order was entered.  This initial order of the North Carolina Court was followed by a preliminary injunction and order continuing the receivership on 8 June 1979.  The relief sought was not resisted by Reserve and judgment by default was entered on 14 September 1979 making the ancillary receivership permanent.  On the same date, the superior court entered a separate order requiring the Commissioner as &quot;Ancillary Receiver&quot; to liquidate Reserve's North Carolina assets, process claims and file his report with the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only asset of Reserve in North Carolina is a special deposit of securities having a face value of $ 185,000.  The securities were deposited with the Treasurer of North Carolina pursuant to Article 20 of Chapter 58 of the General Statutes as a condition of doing business in North Carolina.  Reserve was required to deposit the securities and give the Commissioner a power of attorney to use the securities to pay liabilities of North Carolina policyholders resulting from any default of Reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  North Carolina Insurance Guaranty Association also began operations to pay liabilities and claims for North Carolina policyholders resulting from the insolvency of Reserve.  The Guaranty Association was created by the Insurance Guaranty Association Act, which is Article 17B of Chapter 58 of the General Statutes.  The Association is composed of all casualty insurance companies which transact business in North Carolina.  When a member company is adjudged insolvent by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Association bears the responsibility for paying claims against the company which are greater than $ 100 but not to exceed $ 300,000 per claim.  The payments are financed through membership assessments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 8 June 1979, the Guaranty Association filed a motion, which was allowed, to intervene in the Commissioner's liquidation suit.  On 15 June 1979, the Guaranty Association filed an &quot;answer, counterclaims, crossclaims, and third-party complaint,&quot; the basic purpose of which was to assert the Association's rights to the special securities deposit both as lienor and under a piece of legislation enacted by the General Assembly on 23 May 1979 as part of the Insurance Guaranty Association Act&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  entitled the &quot;Quick Access Statute&quot; and codified as G.S. 58-155.60.  A motion for partial summary judgment was filed with this pleading requesting the court to enter judgment declaring the Guaranty Association's right to have the special deposit of Reserve delivered to the Association to pay covered claims as provided in G.S. 58-155.60.  The Commissioner as ancillary receiver in answer denied the essential allegations of the Guaranty Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 2 July 1979, Carolina Insurance Service, Inc., </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the general agent for Reserve in North Carolina and several individual policyholders on their own behalf and on behalf of other individual policyholders with Reserve, filed motions to intervene in the liquidation suit which were allowed.  These third-party plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment (1) that the policyholders of Reserve had a lien on the special deposit superior to that of the Guaranty Association and (2) that the deposit not be delivered to the Guaranty Association.  On the same day, the Commissioner as Ancillary Receiver moved to dismiss the claim of the Guaranty Association to the deposit, alleging G.S. 58-155.60 was void and unconstitutional.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Carolina Insurance Service, Inc., alleged it held $ 81,326.25 in funds, representing premiums for policies written prior to the liquidation proceeding.  Carolina sought to create a trust for its policyholders in these funds and determine whether they should be paid to the domiciliary receiver or the ancillary receiver.  These questions raised by Carolina are not at issue in this appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The superior court heard arguments of the parties concerning disposition of the special deposits.  The Guaranty Association contended G.S. 58-155.60 gave it a right to the deposit to cover </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">claims and expenses</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> arising out of the insolvency of Reserve.  The Commissioner, Carolina Insurance Service, Inc. and the individual policyholders argued that allowing the Guaranty Association's claim to the special deposit pursuant to G.S. 58-155.60 would interfere with a vested property right of the policyholders in that it would unlawfully and retroactively divest them of their lien rights in the special deposits as specified in G.S. 58-185.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 6 July 1979, the superior court denied the Guaranty Association's motion for summary judgment.  In support of this order, the superior court listed these material facts which were not excepted to by any party on appeal: (1) Reserve was adjudicated insolvent on 29 May 1979; (2) there were more than 1700 policyholders in North Carolina who held contracts of insurance with Reserve written between 30 May 1978 and 7 May 1979; (3) all these policyholders will be entitled to return of the unearned premiums by virtue of the insolvency; (4) the total amount&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of unearned premiums equals approximately $ 184,528.49 of which amount approximately $ 89,096.78 represents claims to be paid by the Guaranty Association and $ 95,431.71 represents total unearned premiums up to a maximum of $ 100 on each policy which will not be paid by the Guaranty Association; and (5) the Quick Access statute,&nbsp;G.S. 58-155.60 was enacted on 23 May 1979 with an effective date of 23 May 1979.  The court then concluded as a matter of law that G.S. 58-155.60 could be applied prospectively only and therefore not to the insurer insolvency in question in this case and that the policyholder liens against the special deposits pursuant to G.S. 58-185 were superior to any rights of the Guaranty Association.  The Guaranty Association appealed to the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals reversed the superior court and remanded the case, ordering that the special deposits be delivered to the Guaranty Association.  That court reasoned G.S. 58-155.60 could be applied retroactively.  The Court of Appeals stated:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">We hold that the superior court committed error when it did not order the deposits of Reserve delivered to the Guaranty Association.  The claimants under G.S. 58-185&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  will retain their lien rights and may proceed against the Guaranty Association to the extent of the deposit for any claims they may have had under G.S. 58-185 which are not satisfied by the Guaranty Association.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insurer was insolvent. The commissioner filed a liquidation action against the insurer.

The court held that &sect; 58-155.60 did not affect the policyholders' lien rights under N.C. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Termination of the mother's rights was sought pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-289.32. That statute permitted the termination of the parental rights of a parent if the child had been placed in the custody of a county department of social services and the parent, for a continuous period of six months preceding the filing of the petition, failed to pay a reasonable portion of the cost of care for the child. The court held that the statute was constitutional and reversed the dismissal of the petition. The court would not consider the mother's argument that the Termination of Parental Rights Act was unconstitutional because it failed to affirmatively provide for the appointment of counsel in all cases of indigency, because both the mother and the minor child were represented by counsel. The court also held that the statute was not vague or overbroad.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from judgments of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Smith (Donald L.), S.J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, entered at the 17 September 1979 Criminal Session of McDowell Superior Court sentencing defendant to life imprisonment following his conviction of the crime of second-degree murder, and imposing two sentences of death following his conviction of two counts of first-degree murder.  This case was docketed and argued as No. 5, Fall Term 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon pleas of not guilty, defendant was tried upon bills of indictment proper in form which charged him with three counts of first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, the state presented evidence which tended to show that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was married and the father of three children: two daughters, Charlotte and Lisa; and one son, Jaime.  The family lived near Rutherfordton, North Carolina.  On 31 May 1979, defendant took a day off from his job with a local tree company.  His older daughter, Charlotte, was to graduate from high school that evening, and he wanted to help her prepare for the festivities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the morning of said date, defendant drove to Chesnee, South Carolina, with Charlotte where he purchased vodka, as well as two six-packs of beer.  The liquor was to be used by Charlotte in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  making punch which was to be served at a party that several of her classmates were staging that evening following the graduation ceremonies.  Charlotte had volunteered to make the party beverage even though she was not planning to attend the gathering herself.  As he drove back to Rutherford County with his daughter, defendant began drinking the beer which he purchased.  The couple arrived at their home at approximately noon.  Shortly thereafter, Charlotte mixed the punch.  In doing so, she used the entire fifth of vodka that her father had purchased, as well as several kinds of fruit juices.  After she finished her task, Charlotte left the house for several hours and went shopping with her boyfriend, Steve Owens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Charlotte returned home at approximately 5:00 p.m., she found her father to be agitated and angry.  Defendant had drunk some of the punch while Charlotte was gone.  He argued that the punch was too strong for the teenager's friends to drink.  Charlotte disagreed and told her father that the punch belonged to her friends because they had paid for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disagreement with his daughter made the defendant more angry than he was already, and he began to insist that Charlotte&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  give him half of the mixture.  She refused and poured it out completely.  Upon doing so, Charlotte filled the container with water and gave it to her father saying that it was no longer too strong.  Defendant continued to press the issue by saying that he was going to return to Chesnee for more liquor so that he could make his own punch.  As Charlotte pleaded with defendant not to ruin her graduation, he began beating her about her face and chest with his fists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During her afternoon shopping trip, Charlotte had purchased several house plants and macrame basket holders.  After she returned home, she began decorating her room with her purchases.  The argument between defendant and his daughter began when she went into the kitchen trying to find some nails to use in her project.  When she entered the kitchen, Charlotte was carrying a hammer.  As he was beating upon her, defendant sought to wrestle the hammer away from his daughter.  In so doing, defendant began choking Charlotte.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commotion in the kitchen caused defendant's wife and their two other children to go into the room to investigate the situation.  Upon seeing the scuffle, they joined the affray and pulled the combatants&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  apart.  Thus freed from the violent grip of her father, Charlotte fled the house and ran across the highway to the home of Mr. and Mrs. Hicks Lewis where she sought refuge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As she entered the Lewis home, Charlotte told Mrs. Lewis that her father was drunk and beating upon her, as well as upon other members of the family.  Mrs. Lewis directed Charlotte to a bedroom at the rear of the house and told her to hide under the bed.  Charlotte did not remain hidden very long.  Instead, she got up, obtained a telephone directory and called the Rutherford County Sheriff's Department.  As a result of Charlotte's call, and her relating what had happened, Deputy Sheriff Roy Huskey and another deputy were dispatched to the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first patrol car on the scene was that driven by Deputy Huskey, who drove his vehicle into defendant's driveway and stopped near the front door.  A second patrol car arrived almost immediately.  It was occupied by Deputy Sheriff Owen Messersmith.  The second cruiser parked partially in the driveway and partially on the highway.  Upon seeing the officers, defendant announced that he was armed and ordered them to leave.  Shortly thereafter, defendant fired four shots. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Both officers were fatally wounded.  Thereupon, defendant left the house and drove away in his automobile, a white Ford.  At the time he left, defendant was armed with a shotgun, as well as a 30.06 rifle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between five and seven minutes after the shots were fired, Steve Owens, Charlotte's boyfriend, arrived at the Lewis' residence, having been called by Charlotte and asked to come get her.  When he went into the house, Owens attended to Charlotte's injuries by putting ice upon her bruised and swollen face.  As Owens did so, Charlotte told him that four shots had been fired, and she asked him to go across the road to investigate.  One could not see the Hutchins' residence from the Lewis' home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Owens drove across the highway and parked in the driveway.  He got out of his car and ran to the second cruiser where he found the dead body of Officer Messersmith sprawled beside the car.  The young man picked up the microphone in the patrol car, and he transmitted a message to the sheriff's office that an officer had been shot.  Owens also informed the authorities that defendant had fled the scene in the family automobile and that he was armed.  The young man did not approach the first vehicle. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Hutchins and the other two children came out of the house unharmed.  They, as well as Charlotte, left with Owens who took them to the Rutherford County Jail for their own safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within a few minutes, Deputy Sheriff Junior Boone, who had heard the radio transmission, arrived on the scene.  The officer found Deputy Messersmith on the ground and without any pulse.  Deputy Messersmith's revolver had not been drawn.  The officer also found Deputy Huskey fatally wounded in the head and slumped in the front seat of his cruiser.  The windshield of the cruiser was shattered.  Huskey's revolver was in the backseat of the patrol car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two members of the North Carolina Highway Patrol, Officer Wayne Spears and Officer Gary Sorrells, were on patrol in Rutherford County.  Both of them were in cruisers which were equipped with scanners which enabled them to pick up transmissions from the Rutherford County Sheriff's Department.  Upon hearing the transmission from Owens, Patrolman Sorrells contacted the Highway Patrol dispatcher in Asheville and conveyed the substance of the call, including a description of defendant's automobile.  Patrolman R. L. Peterson did not have a scanner in his cruiser, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  but he did overhear the conversation between Officer Spears and Sorrells concerning the incident Owens had reported.  Shortly before he overheard the conversation, Officer Peterson had met Officer Robert Kiser, another Highway Patrolman at the Rutherford County and McDowell County line on U.S. Highway 221.  At approximately 5:50 p.m., Trooper Peterson told Trooper Kiser to remain at that location while he traveled south toward Rutherfordton on the highway.  Several minutes after his companion pulled away, Officer Kiser was driving south.  As he drove along, Officer Kiser heard Officer Peterson radio that he had seen a car matching Owens' description going behind a lumber company and that he was in pursuit.  Officers Sorrells, Spears and Kiser all closed in upon the area after the transmission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Trooper Peterson gave chase, he continued to transmit information as to his location.  The last transmission that the officer made was that the white Ford had stopped and that its driver was headed for the woods.  Within a matter of minutes, Officer Spears arrived at the scene and found Officer Peterson dead of a head wound.  The trooper's body was in the front seat.  His gun had been fired&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and was lying on the floor beneath the steering wheel.  There were bullet holes in the windshield, as well as in one of the cruiser's fenders.  Defendant's car was found abandoned on a dirt road approximately a half mile away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once defendant's vehicle was discovered, additional law enforcement officers, as well as bloodhounds, were brought to the area.  At approximately 11:15 p.m., several searchers made the initial contact with defendant.  After identifying himself, defendant refused to surrender and threatened to kill anybody who approached his position.  After inquiring about the condition of the trooper and deputies, and after saying that he had been beaten by the deputies with blackjacks, defendant admitted killing both of them.  When one of the officers stated that he thought the state trooper would be all right, defendant replied that &quot;I know better than that.  I blowed his g-- d--- head off.&quot; At approximately midnight, defendant broke off contact with the search party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers heard movement around their position throughout the night, but they made no effort to change their location.  Defendant spoke with the officers again at approximately 5:15 a.m. on 1 June.  After&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he vocally challenged the searchers, defendant opened fire briefly.  Four more bloodhounds joined the manhunt at 7:00 a.m. Not long after the fresh dogs were released, contact with defendant was made again.  Defendant responded to the officer's calls by asking that the dogs be called off.  Very shortly thereafter, he surrendered to the authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant presented no evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was found guilty of the second-degree murder of Deputy Huskey and the first-degree murders of Deputy Messersmith and Trooper Peterson.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of second-degree murder and two counts of first-degree murder. The McDowell Superior Court (North Carolina) imposed a sentence of life imprisonment and two sentences of death. Defendant raised several issues on appeal, including the contention that the trial court's refusal to discharge defendant's court appointed attorneys violated the Sixth Amendment and denied defendant of his right to effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant shot and killed two police officers who had responded to a call that defendant was choking his daughter, defendant fled the scene and subsequently shot and killed another police officer. The court held that (1) defendant's reason for wanting to discharge his attorneys, which was based on his belief that the attorneys did not spend enough time with him, did not constitute ineffective representation because the evidence indicated that the attorneys were diligent in all respects; (2) the trial court was not obligated to inform the defendant of his right to proceed pro se and defendant never manifested any desire to represent himself; (3) there was sufficient evidence of premeditation to support the first-degree murder charge; (4) the killing of one officer was properly considered as the underlying felony as to the killing of the other officers for purposes of a felony murder charge; and (5) the sentencing procedure of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000 et seq. (1978 and Cum. Supp. 1980) was constitutional and there was no evidence that the death penalty was imposed as a result of the jury's unbridled discretion, nor was it disproportionate or excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant mother petitioned the SUPREME COURT OF NORTH CAROLINA for a rehearing of its prior decision that (1) temporary and permanent custody orders were not binding on the mother because she was never served in accordance with N.C. Gen. Stat. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 4(j)(9); (2) the mother made a general appearance to contest the custody orders; and (3) an Illinois judgment awarding the mother custody was entitled to full faith and credit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court previously held that orders entered in North Carolina awarding plaintiff father temporary, and then permanent, custody were not binding on the mother because she was never properly served in accordance with N.C. Gen. Stat. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 4(j)(9). On reconsideration, the court held that the permanent custody order was a nullity as to the mother because it was a default judgment entered before affidavits were filed in compliance with Rule 4(j)(9)b. The temporary order was superseded by the entry of the permanent order and was not entitled to full faith and credit. The court readopted its prior decision that the mother made a general appearance and waived her right to challenge the trial court's exercise of personal jurisdiction under N.C. Gen. Stat. 1A-1, N.C.

The matter was heard without a jury at the 19 May 1980 Civil Session of Superior Court, Forsyth County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The genesis of this appeal is an ordinance of the Board of Aldermen of the City of Winston-Salem annexing to the City of Winston-Salem five (5) areas containing a total of 4.9 square miles of land having 8,502 residents. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;For the sake of convenience we refer to the annexation ordinances as a single ordinance.  Actually there are five separate ordinances, each corresponding to a separately numbered area.  All five ordinances were adopted at the same meeting of the Board of Aldermen in consecutive order by numbered area.  All five ordinances bear the same ordinance number (D-21927) and are the same in all respects except for the description of the territory annexed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is stipulated in the record on appeal that in its annexation proceedings the City of Winston-Salem duly adopted the ordinance of annexation on 17 December 1979, that all required notices&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were given, that public hearings required by statute were duly held, that all parties were properly before the court and that the court had jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early part of 1979 at the request of the city manager, the assistant city manager, Joe Berrier, requested that the planning department of the City of Winston-Salem prepare maps and population data for all urban areas eligible for annexation.  Staff personnel analyzed the population characteristics of these areas and the city's ability to provide various city services to the areas.  Costs of providing water and sewer services, police and fire protection and other city services were all considered by Mr. Berrier and various department and division heads.  On 13 September 1979 Mr. Berrier sent a letter to all members of the Board of Aldermen requesting that they come by his office to review the maps and discuss proposed plans for annexation.  Meetings of a special annexation committee of the city staff personnel were held in October, 1979, to discuss the costs of annexing certain areas.  On 4 October 1979 maps of ten areas being considered for annexation, including the five areas eventually&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  approved for annexation, were sent to the public works committee and the finance committee of the Board of Aldermen.  On 8 and 9 October 1979, city staff members discussed with the public works and finance committees of the Board the preliminary cost estimates and a time schedule for annexation.  All of the foregoing steps were taken prior to the Board of Aldermen's first formal consideration of the annexation, which occurred on 15 October 1979 when the Board adopted a resolution declaring its intent to annex and setting the date for the public hearing.  On 12 November 1979, the Board of Aldermen held a duly-advertised special meeting and received and approved the annexation study report which proposed annexation of the five areas into the city.  A public hearing was held on 3 December 1979 at which time interested persons were given an opportunity to be heard with respect to the proposed annexation.  On 17 December 1979, the Board adopted the annexation ordinance in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioners filed their petition in the Superior Court, Forsyth County in apt time in accordance with G.S. 160A-50.  The city filed a response and forwarded documents to the court and served copies of the same&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on the petitioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beginning 19 May 1980, Judge Lamm heard over six days of testimony from thirty witnesses, including the petitioners, the mayor, every member of the Winston-Salem Board of Aldermen and eleven city employees (including eight department or division heads).  Judge Lamm made findings of fact and conclusions of law and entered his judgment on 6 June 1980, holding the City of Winston-Salem's annexation of the five areas valid and in conformity with the laws of North Carolina.  From that judgment plaintiffs appealed.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By an indictment proper in form, defendant was charged with the first-degree murder of his wife, Peggy Lupo Martin.  He entered a plea of not guilty, and the state presented evidence summarized in pertinent part as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 5 July 1979, the date of the alleged murder, defendant and Peggy Lupo Martin were husband and wife, but they had been living separate and apart since August 1978.  The couple's two small children lived with Mrs. Martin in an apartment in Laurinburg, North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 6 January 1979, defendant went to Mrs. Martin's residence and tampered with her automobile.  Pursuant to a telephone call from Mrs. Martin, her friend Mrs. Gladys Grant and her husband went to the apartment to take Mrs. Martin and her children to her parent's home.  While the Grants were trying to get Mrs. Martin and the children away from the apartment, defendant told Mrs. Martin: &quot;Peggy, I'm going to kill you . . .  I mean it.  I'm going to kill you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to 4 July 1979, Mrs. Martin had dated Michael Bridges, a Scotland County deputy sheriff, three times.  Deputy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bridges was divorced.  They dated on 4 July 1979, and Deputy Bridges took Mrs. Martin home around midnight.  After her companion left, Mrs. Martin drove to another part of Laurinburg to pick up her children at the home of a babysitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 4 July 1979, Jackie Hulon lived in an apartment next door to that occupied by Mrs. Martin.  Between 11:30 and 12:00 on that night he saw someone trying to enter a window of the Martin apartment.  At about 12:15 a.m. he saw Mrs. Martin return to her apartment with her children.  Several minutes later she ran up to the door of the Hulon apartment and sought entry.  As Mr. Hulon admitted her, she stated that someone had been in her apartment and that her gun was missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within a few moments, defendant, with a pistol in his hand, ran into the apartment.  He fired two shots and Mrs. Martin fell to the floor.  Defendant then ordered Hulon to sit down on the sofa.  Thereafter, defendant struck Mrs. Martin several times with his hand, as well as the pistol, and shot her three more times.  She died as a result of two shots that entered her head.  (Additional details of the killing are hereinafter set out in the opinion.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After emptying the pistol, defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  walked over to a coffee table, laid the gun down and said, &quot;Well, I've done it.&quot; Meanwhile, police had arrived at the scene, and as defendant walked out the front door of the apartment, unarmed, officers arrested him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered no evidence at the guilt phase of the trial.  The court charged the jury on possible verdicts of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter and not guilty.  The jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of murder in the first-degree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the sentencing phase of the trial, the state offered no additional evidence.  The only evidence defendant presented was the testimony of his mother.  She testified that defendant was one of ten children; that although he went to several schools, he was not able to learn; that he was unable to read or write; that he was a nervous person and &quot;if he would get upset, . . . he (would) just go all to pieces&quot;; and that when he was a young boy, he tried to cut himself on several occasions during times of emotional distress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court submitted for consideration of the jury only one of the aggravating circumstances enumerated by G.S. &sect; 15A-2000(e) (Cum. Supp. 1979): whether the murder was especially&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  heinous, atrocious, or cruel.  The jury found that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel.  With respect to mitigating circumstances, the jury found that the murder was not committed while defendant was under the influence of mental or emotional disturbance; that the capacity of defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirement of the law was not impaired; and that there were no other circumstances which the jury deemed to have mitigating value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury also found beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstance found by them outweighed the mitigating circumstances; and that the aggravating circumstance was sufficiently substantial to call for the imposition of the death penalty.  They unanimously recommended to the court that the defendant be sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to the verdict and the sentence recommendation of the jury, the court entered judgment imposing the death penalty.  Defendant appealed to this court pursuant to G.S. &sect; 7A-27(a) (1969).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Subsequent to his conviction for the offense of first degree murder and judgment by the trial court imposing the death penalty, defendant appealed pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-27(a) (1969). The jury had found that defendant's crime was especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel and recommended the death penalty. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment finding that no error were committed. The court found that the evidence presented by the state was more than sufficient to support the jury's verdict of first-degree murder. Furthermore, the court found that the evidence showed that the brutality of the manner in which defendant murdered his wife exceeded that which was normally present in any killing in that it was unnecessarily tortuous to her. The court noted that defendant did not murder his wife in a quick and efficient manner. The court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(e)(9) was not unconstitutionally vague because it the jury was given sufficient guidance concerning the relevant factors about defendant and the crime such that the jury could weigh why the death penalty should have been imposed and mitigating circumstance describing why it should not be imposed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defendant appeals from judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Lewis, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, entered at the 3 December 1979 Criminal Session of Superior Court, McDowell County.  This case was argued as No. 9, Fall Term, 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried upon indictments, proper in form, charging him with first degree murder of Kathy Roxanna Mosley on 24 May 1979 and first degree murder of Mary Kathryn Carnes on 19 June 1979.  The jury found defendant guilty of second degree murder for the killing of Kathy Roxanna Mosley and first degree murder for the killing of Kathryn Carnes.  From the trial court's judgment sentencing him to two terms of life imprisonment, to be served consecutively, defendant appeals as a matter of right pursuant to G.S. 7A-27(a).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State's witness Henry Burnette testified at trial that he was present at defendant Danny Parton's residence in the North Cove section of McDowell County on 24 May 1979, accompanied by defendant, Kathy Mosley, and Kay Wright.  He stated that while he was in a barn next to defendant's house, defendant came to him and confessed that he had just killed Kathy Mosley.  Mr. Burnette followed defendant into the house and observed Ms. Mosley's body lying upon the bed.  He and Kay Wright helped&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant place the body in Ms. Wright's car, drive to a secluded wooded area, dig a grave, and bury the body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henry Burnette further testified that he arrived at defendant's residence at approximately 6:00 p.m. on 19 June 1979 and found Kathryn Carnes present at the house.  On the following day Burnette accompanied defendant and Ms. Carnes to Hunnicutt Creek in McDowell County, ostensibly to go fishing.  Defendant parked the truck in which they were riding approximately one-half mile from the grave of Kathy Mosley.  He informed Burnette that he was going to kill Kathryn Carnes and that they were going to dig her grave before they killed her.  Ms. Carnes watched while the two men dug a grave.  Burnette stated that he then walked into the woods but returned to the grave site when defendant called him.  Upon his return he observed Ms. Carnes lying on the ground with a rope tied around her neck, gasping for air.  Defendant then pulled the rope tighter and choked her until she died.  The two men buried the body, after which defendant told Burnette that a man had paid him $ 4,000.00 to kill Ms. Carnes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further evidence presented by the State tended to show that at approximately 2:47 a.m.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on 18 July 1979, defendant was arrested for disorderly intoxication in Bartow, Florida.  He was immediately advised of his constitutional rights.  Upon his arrival at the Police Department, defendant stated that he wished to confess to the murder of Kathy Mosley and advised the Florida police to contact officials in Gastonia, North Carolina.  Defendant then confessed that he had killed both Kathy Mosley and Kathryn Carnes and had buried their bodies in a wooded area in McDowell County.  Defendant repeated his confession at approximately 4:30 p.m. on 18 July 1979 to Sergeant Reid of the Gaston County Police Department, who had been summoned to Florida by the Bartow Police Department.  Upon his return to North Carolina, defendant showed law enforcement officers where he had buried the bodies, and both bodies were uncovered in the locations indicated.  State Medical Examiner Dr. Page Hudson identified the bodies as those of Kathy Mosley and Kathryn Carnes.  He testified that both women died of strangulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant testified in his own behalf, admitting that he killed Ms. Mosley but denying any participation in the murder of Kathryn Carnes.  He stated that on 24 May 1979 Kathy Mosley&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  came to his house, whereupon the two began to argue.  Ms. Mosley had been living with defendant intermittently for two and one-half years prior to this time.  During the argument Ms. Mosley slapped defendant and defendant reciprocated.  He testified that he could not recall his exact actions in killing Ms. Mosley, but that he remembered being wet with sweat and seeing her lying dead on the bed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant further stated that he remembered none of the events surrounding the death of Kathryn Carnes.  He recalled that he left to go fishing with Ms. Carnes and Henry Burnette on 19 or 20 June 1979, but remembered nothing after leaving his residence that day.  He claimed to have been drinking a great deal of alcohol and ingesting a number of drugs on that day.  He did not recall how he knew the exact location in which Ms. Carnes' body was buried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Rollins, a physician at Dorothea Dix Hospital and a psychiatric consultant at Central Prison, testified that he injected defendant with the drug Sodium Amytal on 21 November 1979 at Dorothea Dix Hospital.  Sodium Amytal is an anesthetic drug administered for the purpose of relaxing the conscious mind of the patient and creating a mental state&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which encourages the patient to answer questions truthfully.  Under the influence of this drug defendant again admitted killing Ms. Mosley but denied any participation in the killing of Ms. Carnes.  Upon further interrogation by Dr. Rollins, he stated that Henry Burnette killed Ms. Carnes.  Defendant related that he had consumed a large amount of alcohol and drugs during the period of time surrounding Ms. Carnes' death.  Dr. Rollins testified on cross-examination that individuals who are excessive alcohol users may be tolerant to Sodium Amytal and less likely to succumb to the anesthetic effects of the drug.  He stated that it was possible for one to tell a falsehood under the influence of the drug.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found defendant guilty of second degree murder for the killing of Kathy Mosley and first degree murder for the killing of Kathryn Carnes.  The jury could not unanimously agree within a reasonable time whether to impose the death penalty or a sentence of life imprisonment for defendant's first degree murder conviction, therefore the judge imposed a sentence of life imprisonment pursuant to G.S. 15A-2000(b).  Defendant also received a sentence of life imprisonment for the second&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  degree murder conviction, the terms to be served consecutively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other facts pertinent to the decision will be set forth in the opinion below.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Shareholders sought money damages, alleging that a corporation had violated the Act by covertly acquiring shares in a company that subsequently merged with the corporation. The trial court granted the corporation's motion for summary judgment, and the shareholders appealed. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment because the Act did not apply to open market share purchases. Under the Act, a tender offer was made when an offer or invitation to purchase was communicated to shareholders, and the fact that open market transactions involved no such offer or invitation was evidence that the Act was not intended to apply to such transactions. The Act had to be construed as a whole and its parts harmonized, but several mandatory provisions, such as the right to withdraw offers, pro rata acceptance of tenders, and increased consideration if an offer's value increased, were inconsistent with and would be unworkable in the normal operation of the open stock market. Whereas a conventional tender offer was distinguished by its attendant pressure on shareholders to make hasty decisions with little information, the challenged acquisition involved only normal market pressure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judge was accused of having made sexual advances on women outside of court. The judge claimed that because the alleged activity did not involve an abuse of office where it was outside of court, he could not have been censured or removed. The court accepted the commission's recommendations, censured the judge, and removed him from office because of enough evidence that the judge's private activity was in reckless disregard of his office, especially where the women were intimidated. Any irregularity with the commission's administrative procedure without prejudice did not invalidate the commission's proceedings. The commission did not use any investigators who were not permitted to work for the commission in the proceedings. The special counsel's employment in the proceedings was proper under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-377(b), though he was borrowed from the state bar. The judge's reelection did not act as public forgiveness of his misconduct, which would have prevented his removal, where his misconduct was not made public and the judicial ethics rules superseded the &quot;public will.&quot; There was no evidence of a conspiracy against the judge and the witnesses against him acted properly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state filed suit and sought an injunction against the adult theater and bookstore and its officers and employees to prohibit them from maintaining and using the theater and bookstore as a nuisance for the illegal exhibition of obscene and lewd films and publications. The trial court reviewed a film and a book and issued the injunction based on the stipulation that other films were similar. The court affirmed on appeal and held that the portion of the trial court's order that involved prior restraint was nothing more that a personalized criminal state. The United States Supreme Court remanded in light of a recent case that found that the Texas statute on injunctions to abate public nuisances was unconstitutional. The court found that the case on the Texas statute was not applicable and reaffirmed its original opinion. The court held that under the North Carolina statute as opposed to the Texas statute the burden of proof was on the state and no penalty, whether fine or imprisonment, could be imposed upon the appellants unless it had been judicially determined that the appellants had sold or exhibited obscene matter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Purported appeal by Wake County from orders of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bason, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, entered 22 August 1980 and 16 September 1980 in Wake County District Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This proceeding was instituted and heard pursuant to the provisions of the North Carolina Juvenile Code, Articles 41-54 of Chapter 7A of the General Statutes.  The proceeding was begun in October 1978 when the juvenile (Scott) was 14 years old.  He was adjudged to be delinquent, and, subsequently, numerous alternatives were pursued in an effort to provide appropriate treatment for Scott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of these alternatives having proved unsuccessful, the court conducted a further hearing on 6 August 1980.  Following that hearing and the entry of an order, the court conducted an additional hearing on 12 September 1980.  A complete history of the case is best presented by quoting from the orders which were entered by the court following each hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pertinent portions of the 22 August 1980 order are as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">This cause came on for hearing on August 6, 1980, upon Motion for Review by Steven J. Williams, Chief Court Counselor, Tenth Judicial District.  The following persons were present for said hearing: Scott Brownlee; Copper Rain, mother of Scott&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  Brownlee; Steven J. Williams, Chief Court Counselor; and Martha Kay Mayberry, Wake County Department of Social Services.  The respondent child was represented by Sandra L. Johnson, Attorney at Law.  John C. Cooke, Assistant County Attorney, appeared on behalf of Wake County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">At the hearing on August 6, 1980, Mr. Cooke voiced the county's interest in said hearing in that the Motion for Review requested that the court consider the appropriate entity to provide financial resources to pay for needed treatment and educational services of the respondent child at the Brown School in Austin, Texas.  Mr. Cooke further objected to testimony by the Chief Court Counselor regarding the opinions of others as to Scott's treatment and educational needs and as to information received from others regarding possible placements for Scott.  The hearing was continued until August 18, 1980, upon the court's own motion so that those persons whose opinions were to be testified to by Mr. Williams could be present at the hearing and available for examination by the county attorney, and so that the county would have the opportunity to prepare and present evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Wake County's Motion requesting that the court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  rule that said county is not a party to this juvenile proceeding was filed on August 11, 1980.  Said motion came on for hearing on August 18, 1980.  Mr. Cooke appeared on behalf of the county.  The respondent was represented by Sandra L. Johnson.  The court deferred its ruling on said motion and proceeded with the hearing over the county's objection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">. . . on August 18, 1980, having been continued from August 6, 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">After considering the factual evidence, including the testimony of witnesses, documents and written reports concerning the child's condition and needs, the court finds the facts set forth below and enters its conclusions of law and judgment thereon as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1. The court takes judicial notice of and finds as fact all matters set forth in official court records related to the respondent child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2. Scott was adjudicated delinquent on October 25, 1978.  Disposition was continued for two weeks to allow time for development of treatment plan, with temporary placement at Wake House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">3. . . .  Said order incorporated by reference the report resulting from a psychological evaluation of Scott performed by Marguerite Robinson, M.A. on October&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  18, 1978, and called for implementation of the recommendations contained therein.  Said psychological evaluation found Scott to be a child of above average intelligence with deep-seated emotional problems which keep him from using his intelligence to its potential and result in poor inner controls.  Evaluation at Dorothea Dix Hospital was recommended, with temporary placement at Wake House to continue.  The evaluation report pointed to Scott's probable need for long-term therapeutic intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">4. Scot was evaluated at Dorothea Dix Hospital during November of 1978 upon referral from Trentman Mental Health Center.  Scott was denied admission to Dorothea Dix Hospital based upon a diagnosis of 'Impulse Ridden Personality.' Scott was found to be dependent upon his environment for control of his impulses, and treatment in a program offering external structure and controls with behavior management, probably throughout his adolescence, was recommended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">5. Scott was admitted to Duncraig Manor on March 14, 1979, from which he was discharged in May of 1979, as a result of behavioral problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">6. Scott was adjudicated delinquent on June 25, 1979, and placed on twelve months probation. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">7. Scott was adjudicated delinquent on November 19, 1979, and was committed to the custody of the North Carolina Department of Human Resources, Division of Youth Services, on said date.  The court recommended that considerations be given to placement of Scott in several special programs operated by the Department of Human Resources and further requested that the Division of Youth Services advise the court, immediately following screening of what program was available for Scott.  No treatment plan or information regarding available programs has been received by this court from the Division of Youth Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">8. Scott was placed at Samarcand Manor by the Division of Youth Services, where he was considered for admission to the Title XX program but was not admitted to said program.  Shortly after Scott arrived at Samarcand, Dr. Thomas Cornwall, a child psychiatrist consulting at Samarcand [examined him and found him to be anxious, depressed, and feeling that his situation was hopeless].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">9. Scott was admitted to [Dorothea Dix State Hospital] for evaluation on January 21, 1980, and was discharged on February 27, 1980, upon findings that he is a child with 'long standing personality&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  problems' in need of a safe environment where he can begin to learn to trust people and to tolerate limits being placed on him.  Scott was diagnosed as suffering from an 'Impulse Ridden Personality with questionable Borderline Personality Organization' and was seen by the hospital as an inappropriate candidate for long term treatment at Dorothea Dix because he would not benefit from the intensive psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatment available through the hospital's programs for adolescents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">10. Efforts by the office of the Chief Court Counselor to locate a placement for Scott in state-supported residential treatment facilities have been unsuccessful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">11. Scott remains in need of treatment for his serious emotional problems and of specialized educational services appropriate to his needs.  He has not received and is not receiving appropriate educational services there.  Treatment and education appropriate to his needs are not available to him at Samarcand Manor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">12. It is the opinion of Dr. Cornwall who was directly involved in Scott's evaluation at Dorothea Dix Hospital, and of Dr. Lenore Behar of the Division of Mental Health Services that no residential treatment facility&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  appropriate to Scott's needs currently exists in the State of North Carolina, and no such program is known to the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">13. The educational and psychiatric needs of Scott Brownlee while committed to the custody of the Division of Youth Services have not been met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">14. The Director of the Division of Youth Services did not exercise his [option] under G.S. 7A-665 to seek an alternative disposition for a juvenile committed to the care of the Division and found not to be suitable for its program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">16. The court now finds that its order committing Scott to the custody of the Division of Youth Services is not in his best interest and further finds that said commitment is inappropriate in that the court's increased awareness of the severity of Scott's emotional disturbance and the extent of his behavioral problems, together with the court's findings that his treatment and educational needs have been and continue to be unmet; constitute a change in circumstances which requires that the court vacate and revoke its prior order of commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">17. Scott has nowhere to go as of the date of this order, and it is not in his best interest to vacate his commitment to training school effective&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">18. Upon recommendation of Dr. Cornwall and as a result of efforts by his court counselor, Scott had been accepted for admission to the Brown School in Austin, Texas.  The Brown School is a residential treatment facility which offers both appropriate treatment for his severe emotional and behavioral problems and appropriate specialized educational services.  The costs associated with placement at the Brown School are in excess of $ 40,000 per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">19. No appropriate treatment alternatives other than the Brown School are known to the court at this time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">20. Scott's mother, Copper Rain, is employed as a bartender.  Her net weekly salary is $ 105.00 per week.  She has two other children who reside with her for approximately 105 days per year.  She has no health insurance or other assets from which she can pay for the cost of care at the Brown School or any other residential facility.  Ms. Rain's effort to secure support from Scott's father through Interstate Child Support Enforcement proceedings have been unsuccessful to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">21. The Department of Human Resources is not now able to purchase care for Scott in a private residential treatment facility for the reason that no&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  funds have been appropriated for the purpose of purchasing private residential care for emotionally disturbed children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">23. The court is hopeful that the North Carolina Department of Human Resources, Wake County Area Mental Health Program and the Wake County Board of Education will develop an appropriate treatment and educational plan for Scott which can be implemented immediately and/or will identify and make available funds necessary to provide or purchase such appropriate treatment and education at the Brown School or in some other appropriate program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">24. If such plans and/or funds are not forthcoming, this court will have no resource other than Wake County to which it can look for funds necessary to purchase the treatment Scott needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">A. Upon review, the court concludes that its order committing the respondent child to the custody of the Division of Youth Services is not in said child's best interest.  The current needs of the juvenile and the change in circumstances since said order was entered require that the court vacate and revoke its prior order of commitment pursuant to N.C. G.S. &sect; 7A-664 (a).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">B. Scott Brownlee is in need of treatment and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  care for his severe emotional problems and of specialized educational services.  He is not receiving said services at this time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">C. Scott's mother is unable to pay the cost of the care and treatment Scott needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">D. This court, in this proceeding, does not have the authority to order the Department of Human Resources, Wake County Area Mental Health Program or the Wake County Board of Education to provide particular treatment or funding of treatment while the juvenile is committed to the custody of the Division of Youth Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">E. If an appropriate treatment and educational plan for Scott is not developed and funded by the Department of Human Resources, and/or Wake County Area Mental Health and/or the Wake County Board of Education, the court's only alternative for securing the funds necessary to provide the treatment Scott needs will be to charge the cost of said treatment to the county pursuant to G.S. &sect; 7A-647 (3).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">A. This court's commitment of Scott Brownlee to the custody of the Division of Youth Services is hereby vacated and revoked effective September 12, 1980, pursuant to N.C. G.S. &sect; 7A-664.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">B. Disposition in this matter shall be continued until September 12, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">C. The North Carolina Department of Human Resources, Wake County Area Mental Health Program and the Wake County Board of Education are hereby requested to attempt to make available funds necessary to secure placement for Scott Brownlee in the Brown School or some other appropriate treatment facility or to develop and arrange for immediate implementation of an appropriate treatment and educational program by September 12, 1980, and to inform the court of the results of said efforts on or before that date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">D. Wake County is hereby notified that if an appropriate treatment and educational plan or funds to secure placement in any appropriate program are not forthcoming from other sources on or before September 12, 1980, this court will on that date turn to the county for any information and assistance it may wish and/or be able to offer regarding placement of Scott in an appropriate treatment facility which is less expensive than the Brown School.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">E. The court requests that the county participate in the dispositional hearing on September 12, 1980.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 11 August 1980 Wake County filed a motion in the cause asking the court to rule that Wake County is not a party to the proceeding. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thereafter, the court ruled that the County was not a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">necessary</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> party but, as stated in the above order, requested the County to participate in the dispositional hearing scheduled for 12 September 1980.  The record indicates that the County did not participate in that hearing.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Pertinent portions of the 16 September 1980 order are as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">This cause came on for hearing on September 12, 1980, with disposition having been continued until said date by Order entered August 22, 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">After considering the factual evidence, including the testimony of witnesses, documents and written reports concerning the respondent child's condition and needs and the programs and resources available to meet those needs, the court finds from the facts set forth below that the following disposition would best provide for the protection, treatment, rehabilitation and correction of the child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1. The court takes judicial notice of and finds as fact all matters set forth in official court records relating to the respondent child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2. The court takes judicial notice of and hereby incorporates by reference all matters set forth in its order of August 22, 1980, in this matter. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">3. Copies of this court's order of August 22, 1980, were served on the following persons:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c14">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Mr. John C. Cooke, Assistant Wake County Attorney:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c14">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Mr. Carl Johnson, Wake County Manager; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Mr. M. Edmund Aycock, Chairman, Wake County Commissioners.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">4. The court regrets that Wake County did not participate in the hearing on September 12, 1980, as requested by Order entered on August 22, 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">5. A proposal requesting funding to implement an appropriate treatment plan for Scott in Wake County was submitted to the North Carolina Department of Human Resources following entry of this court's order of August 22, 1980.  Wake County Schools agreed to provide the funding necessary for the educational component of the plan.  Funding for said proposal was denied by the Department of Human Resources on September 11, 1980.  The court appreciates the efforts of Mr. Kirkpatrick, Ms. Lambe and others involved in these efforts and regrets the decision of the Department of Human Resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">6. A proposed placement and treatment plan was presented by Lenore Behar, Ph.D., on behalf of the Department of Human Resources.  The Department proposed placement in a new residential&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  program for children between the ages of 10 and 17 to be developed on the campus of John Umstead Hospital.  Dr. Behar testified that she did not know who in the Department of Human Resources decided that placement in the proposed program at John Umstead Hospital would be appropriate for Scott, that she was not involved in that decision and that she was instructed by her superiors on September 11, 1980, to develop a plan for Scott's placement in that program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">7. The proposed program at John Umstead Hospital is not yet in existence.  Renovations to buildings have not been completed and not all of the staff has been hired.  Dr. Behar testified that she did not know when the rest of the staff will be hired.  The screening procedures for admission to the program are not yet in place and it is not possible for the court to determine the ages or conditions of other children with whom Scott would be living and interacting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">8. The Department of Human Resources' proposed written plan for Scott's treatment includes an accurate description of Scott's needs and strengths and specifies appropriate long and short term treatment goals.  However, the court is not able to find from the evidence before&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  it that the plan, whenever it could be implemented, would be an appropriate placement or would constitute an appropriate treatment plan.  There is no evidence before the court from a psychiatrist familiar with Scott's condition and needs relating to details of the program to be offered to Scott by the proposed program at John Umstead Hospital and there is no opinion from such a psychiatric expert that placement in the program would be appropriate and in Scott's best interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">9. Scott was discharged from Samarcand Manor on September 3, 1980.  Scott has been in the custody of the Department of Human Resources since November 19, 1980.  He was evaluated at Dorothea Dix Hospital in January and February of 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">10. The court appreciates Dr. Behar's appearance at the hearing and her efforts to develop the plan suggested by the Department of Human Resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">11. The court finds again that Scott Brownlee is in need of treatment for his serious emotional problems.  The court further finds again that no treatment facility appropriate to Scott's needs currently exists in the State of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">12. The 'Brown Schools' is in reality a system of residential psychiatric treatment programs&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  in Texas.  Said program includes a variety [of] residential treatment facilities and specialized programs, each of which offers specialized services according to the needs of the patient.  All programs of the Brown Schools are accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">13. The court finds that the Brown Schools offer appropriate treatment for Scott, which treatment is immediately available to him in that he has been accepted for admission and that the court was informed at the hearing on September 12, 1980, that he can be admitted to the program's Short-Term Adolescent Center as soon as necessary paper work is completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">14. The court finds that no appropriate placement and treatment plan other than that available at the Brown Schools is known to the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">15. The court finds that costs associated with treatment at the Brown Schools are consistent with costs at other treatment facilities and are less than those associated with treatment in some residential psychiatric treatment programs.  Specifically, the cost of treatment in the Adolescent Admission Service, Ward 601, Dorothea Dix Hospital is approximately $ 65,000 per patient per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">16. The court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  specifically incorporates herein its finding in the Order of August 22, 1980, that Scott's mother is unable to pay for the cost of the treatment he needs.  Her net income is approximately $ 105. per week.  She has two other children who reside with her approximately 105 days per year.  She has no health insurance or other income or assets with which to pay for the treatment Scott needs.  Her efforts to secure support for Scott from his father through Interstate Enforcement Proceedings have been unsuccessful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">17. Scott is in need of care and supervision which his parent cannot provide and is in need of placement.  Placement of Scott in the Brown Schools will be facilitated by placing him in the custody of the Wake County Department of Social Services in that his mother is not able to make the financial arrangements necessary for admission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">18. Admission to the Brown Schools does not require a commitment that the child will remain a patient there for any particular period of time.  Charges are made for services actually rendered and are charged on a daily basis between admission and discharge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">19. In addition to daily charges, other costs associated with treatment at the Brown Schools&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  include costs of transportation, medical and dental care and clothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">20. The court remains hopeful that an appropriate placement and treatment program for Scott will be developed and funded in Wake County or elsewhere in North Carolina and remains ready to consider modification of this Order if it can be shown that such a program does exist and that transfer to that program will be in Scott's best interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">21. The court finds that it is in Scott's best interest that he be admitted to the Brown Schools immediately in that he has been waiting for appropriate placement and treatment for many months and that no other alternative is available.  Further delay in appropriate placement and commencement of appropriate treatment will be damaging to him.  The court further finds that there is no assurance that this placement and the treatment it offers this seriously disturbed child will remain available if he is not admitted at once.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">A. Scott is in need of care and supervision which his mother cannot provide and is in need of placement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">B. Scott is in need of psychiatric, psychological and other treatment of his serious emotional problems.  Placement in the Brown Schools&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  is in Scott's best interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">C. Scott's mother is unable to pay the cost of the care and treatment he needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">D. Scott's great need of immediate treatment, the immediate availability of such treatment at the Brown Schools and the long delay in receiving appropriate treatment to which Scott has already been subjected compel immediate placement at the Brown Schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">E. This court has the authority to order the treatment Scott needs and to charge the cost to Wake County pursuant to G.S. 7A-647 (3).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1. Scott Brownlee is hereby placed in the custody of the Wake County Department of Social Services pursuant to G.S. 7A-647 (2) in order to facilitate placement at the Brown Schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2. Scott Brownlee is hereby ordered to the Brown Schools for residential treatment pursuant to G.S. 7A-649 (6).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">3. All arrangements necessary for Scott's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">immediate</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14"> admission to the Brown Schools shall be made by the Chief Court Counselor and the Wake County Department of Social Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">4. The cost of Scott's care at the Brown Schools shall be paid by Wake County pursuant to G.S. 7A-647 (3).  The county is hereby ordered to cooperate with the Chief Court Counselor and the Department&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  of Social Services in making the arrangements necessary for Scott's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">immediate</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14"> admission to the Brown Schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">5. The Wake County Department of Social Services is hereby relieved of responsibility for identifying alternative placements for Scott until such time this court's order for placement at the Brown Schools is vacated or modified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">6. This order and Scott's placement at the Brown Schools shall be implemented immediately pursuant to G.S. 7A-668 notwithstanding appeal by any interested party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">7. The court will consider modification of this Order upon motion of any interested party at such time as it can be alleged that appropriate treatment and placement for Scott Brownlee at a program other than those offered by the Brown Schools is actually available and that transfer to such program would be in his best interest.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 28 August 1980 Wake County gave and served notice of appeal to the 22 August 1980 order.  The County also petitioned the Court of Appeals for writs of prohibition and mandamus; the petition was denied without prejudice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 17 September 1980 Wake County gave and served notice of appeal to the 12 September 1980 order.  On the same day, the County again petitioned&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Court of Appeals for a writ of mandamus or, in the alternative, a writ of supersedeas; it also asked for an order temporarily staying the orders of the district court.  On 23 September 1980 the Court of Appeals granted a temporary stay but on 25 September 1980 it dissolved the stay and denied the petition for mandamus and supersedeas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 29 September 1980 Wake County applied to this court for a temporary stay of the orders entered by Judge Bason pending preparation and filing of a petition for a writ of certiorari.  On 30 September 1980 this court, feeling that an expedited decision of this case is in the public interest, elected to invoke Rule 2 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure and ordered: (1) that the application for a stay order be denied; (2) that the petition be treated as a motion to bypass the Court of Appeals and that the motion be granted; (3) that the times for filing the record on appeal and the briefs be accelerated; and (4) that this matter be specially set for hearing at the December 1980 session of this court. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;This court took note of the fact that arrangements for Scott's admission to the Brown Schools had been made; that he was to be admitted at 9:00 a.m. on Wednesday, 1 October 1980; that transportation arrangements to Austin, Texas had been made for the afternoon of 30 September 1980; and that the Wake County Board of Commissioners on 23 September 1980 had passed a resolution appropriating the sum of $ 16,000 to the Wake County Department of Social Services to cover the estimated cost of three months initial care, travel to and incidental expenses at the Brown Schools.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant county sought review of a decision from the Wake County District Court (North Carolina), which entered an order requiring the county to pay for a juvenile's out-of-state residential psychiatric treatment program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The present case brought before the court two principal questions for the court's consideration: (1) whether the county was entitled to appeal from the orders entered by the district court; and (2) whether the district court was empowered to direct the county to provide care for respondent at the out-of-state facility. These issues were separate and distinct. On appeal, the court held that the county did not have a right to appeal from the challenged orders, but that the court was authorized to issue any remedial writs necessary to give it general supervision and control over the proceedings of the other courts of the state when necessary to promote the expeditious administration of justice. The court considered the present case to be of such importance that the expeditious administration of justice required the court to invoke its supervisory authority. The court also held that the general assembly did not intended to vest the court with the authority to order a child committed to an out-of-state facility and charge the cost of the care so provided to the county. Accordingly, the court reversed the judgment of the district court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff petitioner pursuant to G.S. 160A-50(h) from judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Brewer, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, entered 4 March 1980 in Orange Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner seeks a declaratory judgment and review of an annexation ordinance of the Town of Carrboro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At its 23 October 1979 meeting, the Carrboro Board of Aldermen passed resolutions expressing intent to annex certain property to the north and west of existing town limits and to hold a public hearing on the question on 3 December 1979; notice of said public hearing was published in the Chapel Hill newspaper on 11, 18 and 25 November and 2 December 1979.  The Town also prepared an Annexation Plan Report dated 23 October 1979.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner owns property adjoining a state-maintained secondary road within the proposed area to be annexed.  At the time of the 3 December hearing, petitioner was receiving adequate fire protection from the Town of Carrboro under contract with Orange County; the Orange County Sheriff's Department had law enforcement jurisdiction over petitioner's property; the property was not hooked up to the water and sewer system operated by the Orange Water and Sewer Authority (OWASA); and petitioner's property was served by a private&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  garbage collection service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the 3 December hearing, several people testified, including the Carrboro planning director, the chairman of the Planning Board, a spokesman for the Economic Development Commission and residents of the proposed annexation area.  Residents of the proposed annexation area spoke unanimously against annexation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sonna Loewenthal, the Town's planning director, testified that upon annexation, area residents would immediately have all the privileges and responsibilities of Town citizens.  She then read from and commented upon the Annexation Plan Report, copies of which she said were available to the public.  The planning director stated the Town intended to provide services to the annexed area in &quot;substantially the same manner as provided to the rest of the town.&quot; She further stated that the annexation area already had fire protection through the South Orange Fire District and that all streets except those in the Barrington Hills subdivision were part of the state highway system maintained by the Department of Transportation.  Loewenthal anticipated no capital expenditures as a result of the annexation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert McDuffey, chairman of the Planning Board, testified&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  against the proposed annexation.  He stated the Planning Board had passed a unanimous resolution saying that the development of an initial annexation proposal should not have been the responsibility of the Town staff alone and that there should have been more communication before the public hearing between the Town government and the Planning Board.  He stated that the Planning Board felt only the Barrington Hills subdivision and an apartment complex were suitable for annexation since the remaining area was rural and already within the Town's planning district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miles Crenshaw, spokesman for the Economic Development Commission, stated that it would be advantageous to Carrboro not to annex rural areas likely to be industrialized in the near future until they were developed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 19 December, the Carrboro Board of Aldermen adopted an annexation ordinance effective 31 December 1979 incorporating certain portions, but not all, of the area proposed for annexation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner filed this action on 18 January 1980 alleging unconstitutionality of the annexation statutes and the Town of Carrboro's failure to meet requirements of annexation set out in those statutes.  At the 18 February 1980&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  hearing on the matter, petitioner moved to amend his pleading to include an allegation regarding the failure of the Town to include in its Annexation Plan Report a statement on its intent to provide bus service in the annexed area.  The court denied this motion.  The constitutional claims were dismissed.  The annexation ordinance was remanded to the Town Board of Aldermen for purposes of bringing the Annexation Plan Report and the annexation ordinance within the statutory requirements.  The trial court stated:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">[T]here is insufficient specificity to enable the Court or a reviewing body to make a reasonable and intelligent appraisal of the Town of Carrboro's capacity and intent to provide services to the newly annexed area and based on such finding the Court concludes that there is a fatal lack of specificity in the Section III entitled, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Provision of Services</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 26 February, the Carrboro Board of Aldermen adopted a resolution which amended the annexation report.  The amended report was served on petitioner on 4 March, the same day a hearing was held in superior court on the annexation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The superior court found the Revised Annexation Plan Report demonstrated prima facie&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  compliance with G.S. 160A, Art. 4A, Part 3.  The ordinance adopted 19 December 1979 was declared valid and enforceable.  The superior court affirmed the action of the Board of Aldermen in adopting the ordinance.  Petitioner appealed to this Court.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff owner appealed a judgment of the Orange County Superior Court (North Carolina), which declared defendant town's annexation plan valid and enforceable and affirmed the adoption of the annexation ordinance in the owner's action for declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner filed an action for declaratory judgment and review of the town's annexation ordinance. The trial court found that the annexation plan demonstrated prima facie compliance with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A and affirmed its adoption. On appeal, the owner argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to amend his pleading. The owner also argued that that the annexation procedure contained in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-45 to 56 was unconstitutional in that it does not provide for a jury trial and that the town's ordinance did not comply with the annexation statutes. The court affirmed, finding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to amend where the proposed amendment was untimely and would have caused needless delay. The requirements contained in the annexation statutes were solely legislative matters for which a trial by jury was not guaranteed. Finally, the town's statement that the annexation was designed to promote sound urban development and assure adequate provision of government services was in sufficient compliance with the general statement of legislative intent found in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-45.</SPAN></P>

App. 621, 260 S.E. 2d 120 (1979), reversing judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Smith (Donald), J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, entered 24 July 1978 in Wake Superior Court.  A petition by these appellants for discretionary review was at first denied but later granted on rehearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based upon stipulations of the parties at trial and the findings of the trial court to which no exceptions have been taken, the facts and circumstances which give rise to this appeal may be briefly stated as follows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1975, a medical malpractice insurance crisis developed in North Carolina when the companies which traditionally provided such coverage announced their withdrawal from the malpractice insurance market.  The General Assembly responded to the crisis on 28 May 1975 by enacting Chapter 427 of the 1975 North Carolina Session Laws entitled &quot;An Act to Establish a Health Care Liability Reinsurance Exchange&quot; (the Act) which was subsequently codified as G.S. 58-173.34&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Act required certain classes of general liability insurers, licensed to write liability insurance in North Carolina, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to insure applicants for medical malpractice insurance, to participate in a nonprofit, unincorporated legal entity created by the Act known as the North Carolina Health Care Liability Reinsurance Exchange (the Reinsurance Exchange) and to participate in losses suffered by the Reinsurance Exchange on a pro rata basis based on the amount of general liability insurance written by the insurer in North Carolina.  A general liability insurer could not engage in the writing of any liability insurance in North Carolina unless it complied with the provisions of the Act by providing medical malpractice insurance and participating in the Reinsurance Exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs on this appeal are an affiliated group of Illinois insurance corporations collectively known as the Kemper Group, authorized to write general liability coverage in North Carolina.  Prior to 1975, they were not writing health care liability insurance in North Carolina and had no personnel in the State with expertise in this field of insurance.  The plan of operation for the Reinsurance Exchange was promulgated by the Commissioner of Insurance on 6 August 1975.  Shortly thereafter, general liability insurers writing insurance in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  North Carolina began filing numerous individual suits challenging the constitutionality of the Reinsurance Exchange legislation and obtaining preliminary injunctions staying the application of the Act.  Plaintiffs subscribed to the plan of operation subject, however, &quot;to the reservation of its rights through legal proceedings to question the legality of said plan and the statute authorizing its adoption.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 24 September 1975, plaintiffs mailed to each of their agents a document entitled &quot;Statement of Intent, Notice of Protest and Reservation of Rights&quot; which contained the following:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;Any policy or binder of physicians and surgeons professional liability insurance issued by the Kemper Insurance Company identified below, hereinafter referred to as the Company, is issued under the mandate of North Carolina House Bill 74, Chapter 427, Session Laws of 1975, (G.S. 58-173.23 et seq.) [sic] and is issued under protest and not as a voluntary act of the Company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">The validity of this statute is being tested in court.  The Company intends to reinsure all eligible physicians and surgeons professional liability insurance policies and binders in the North Carolina Health Care Liability Reinsurance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  Exchange, an entity created by the statute.  The Company does not intend to assume any risk on its own account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Any coverage under this policy or binder may be contingent upon the statute being valid and the ability of the Reinsurance Exchange to adequately reinsure this policy or binder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">In the event that any court declares, or enters a judgment the effect of which is to render the provisions of House Bill 74, Chapter 427, Session Laws of 1975 (G.S. 58-173.23 et seq.) [sic] invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, or in the event the Reinsurance Exchange is inadequately funded, the Company may have the option to consider this policy as null and void as of the inception date.  The Company intends to exercise that option if it is available.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moore and Johnson Insurance Agency (Moore and Johnson), which had represented the Kemper Group in Raleigh for approximately ten years, acknowledged receipt of the &quot;Statement of Intent, Notice of Protest and Reservation of Rights&quot; in a letter dated 29 September 1975 written by Earl Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1969, Moore and Johnson had been employed by Wake Anesthesiology Associates, Inc., and the doctors practicing therewith, Haynes, King&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and Schick, to provide medical malpractice insurance coverage.  This coverage had been provided since 1969 by St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company, which gave notice that it would terminate coverage at 12:01 a.m., 1 October 1975.  Harry W. Moore of Moore and Johnson undertook to obtain other malpractice insurance coverage for defendant appellants who had decided to limit their professional practice to emergency cases only due to the unavailability of medical malpractice insurance.  On 30 September, Moore and Johnson verbally bound coverage to defendant appellants on behalf of Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company (Lumbermens), a plaintiff in this action, for a period beginning 1 October 1975 and ending 1 November 1975.  Based upon the verbal binder, defendant appellants continued the next day and thereafter to perform without restriction or limitation their usual professional services.  Lumbermens issued a written binder which was forwarded to defendant appellants by Moore and Johnson on 17 October 1975.  The &quot;Statement of Intent, Notice of Protest and Reservation of Rights&quot; was attached to the binder.  In a letter sent to defendant appellants with the binder, Harry Moore wrote&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in part the following:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;Enclosed is the Malpractice Insurance Binder issued in the Lumbermen's Mutual Casualty Company to cover your operations for a period from 10/1/75 to 11/1/75.  The reason for the binder instead of a policy is that the Lumbermen's Mutual Casualty Company does not have the necessary forms on hand to issue policies at this time.  They expect to have them in within the next week or so at which time they will issue the policy, and we will forward to you . . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">I discussed the attached Statement of Intent with Dr. Haynes this afternoon and explained to him that I had a conversation with the insurance company this morning in which they stated that the Statement of Intent did not accurately express their position.  They assured me that regardless of the wording of the Statement of Intent, your coverage is and will be in force and that you have nothing to worry about on this score.  To be on the safe side, I wrote Mr. Russ Cossart, Manager of the commercial lines underwriting department of the insurance company, reviewing our conversation and asking for written confirmation.  As soon as we receive his reply, I will send you a copy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">At this moment, based on assurances&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  from the insurance company, I can assure you that you are fully and adequately covered up to $ 1,000,000.  If there are any new developments, I will, of course, get in touch with you at once.  If you have any questions, in the meantime, please do not hesitate to call me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harry Moore, that day, wrote Russell Cossart, the Commercial Lines Underwriting Manager for Kemper Insurance, requesting written confirmation of the effect of the &quot;Statement of Intent, Notice of Protest and Reservation of Rights&quot; on the insurance binder.  In his letter to Cossart, Moore stated:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;Today we received binders in the Lumbermen's Mutual Casualty Company for the physicians in caption with your Statement of Intent attached.  After receiving these binders, I called you to discuss coverage that would be afforded these physicians in the event the North Carolina Health Care Liability Reinsurance Exchange was found to be unconstitutional by the North Carolina Courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">In our conversation you assured me that regardless of the wording in the Statement of Intent, if the Reinsurance Exchange was found to be unconstitutional, the physicians covered by these binders and subsequent policies to be issued when&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  the proper forms are available would have malpractice coverage for the period of their binders or policies.  Depending on the Court ruling, it is our understanding that their coverage could be either with the Lumbermen's Mutual or some company to be designated as the carrying company for the Exchange.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cossart in reply to this letter on 30 October 1975 stated:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;As we all agree, the malpractice mess has us all in a lot of trouble and therefore the companies that are involved are trying to protect themselves against being forced into something that they are either not capable of handling or choose to not handle because of the guaranteed loss involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">We still do not know where we stand with regard to the constitutionality of the Malpractice Act nor do we know where we stand as far as the St. Paul is concerned, but at this point I think we have to agree that the company is offering binders for malpractice coverage which means that we are the carrier at this point.  Hopefully all of this will be resolved the week of Nov. 3 and the persons seeking insurance will find a market that is technically competent to handle this insurance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The binder expired the next day. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The binder contained a termination clause which provided:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;This binder shall expire at the end of the binder period shown in Item 3 or it shall terminate (1) immediately on notice of cancelation by the named insured or the company or (2) on its effective date if replaced by a policy as stated herein.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant appellants were never given notice of cancellation of the binder.  No premiums were ever billed to defendant appellants for the binder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 6 October 1976, defendant appellants were sued for damages in a civil action alleging professional malpractice arising out of acts committed on 5 October 1975.  Lumbermens denied coverage, contending its binder was void </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ab initio</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> because the unconstitutional Reinsurance Exchange Act had coerced Lumbermens into issuing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 30 September 1975, the day the verbal binder was issued to defendant appellants, plaintiffs filed a complaint in Wake Superior Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from the Reinsurance Exchange and its enabling legislation.  Plaintiffs requested the trial court to &quot;enter a declaratory judgment determining that the Act is unlawful, invalid and void and that all applications received and binders&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  issued thereunder are null, void and unenforceable . . . .&quot; A temporary restraining order was issued at 5:30 p.m. the same day staying the Commissioner of Insurance from applying the provisions of the Act to plaintiffs.  Some forty-eight physicians and professional associations, including defendant appellants, had been given verbal binders by agents for plaintiffs before the temporary restraining order was granted on 30 September, but they were not made parties to the 30 September action until the trial court so ordered on 29 October 1975.  Defendant appellants were served with a summons and copy of the complaint on the day the binder expired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 9 October 1975, this action was consolidated with all other actions seeking similar relief and a preliminary injunction was subsequently issued.  On 29 October 1975, the day defendant appellants were made parties to the action, the trial court severed from the action to have the Reinsurance Exchange legislation declared unconstitutional the claim for relief which requested that binders issued by plaintiffs be declared null and void.  The Reinsurance Exchange Act was declared unconstitutional in Wake Superior Court on 7 November 1975, a judgment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this Court affirmed in 290 N.C. 457, 226 S.E. 2d 498 (1976). The Reinsurance Exchange ceased to operate from the date of the judgment in Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The severed claim for relief from binders issued by plaintiffs to the forty-eight physicians and professional associations was tried without a jury at the 24 April 1978 Session of Wake Superior Court.  Only Wake Anesthesiology Associates, Inc., and Drs. Haynes, King and Schick were represented by counsel.  Based upon its findings of fact, the trial court made the following conclusions of law:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;1. Harry W. Moore, in his capacity as an independent insurance agent in Raleigh, North Carolina, was an agent both for the plaintiffs herein and for defendants, Wake Anesthesiology Associates, Inc., and Drs. Haynes, King and Schick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2. Russ Cossart was an agent for the plaintiffs herein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">3. Harry W. Moore had apparent authority to alter the terms of the Statement of Intent, Notice of Protest and Reservation of Rights but neither Harry W. Moore nor any other employee of Moore &amp; Johnson Insurance Agency effectively altered the terms of such Statement of Intent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">4. Russ Cossart had apparent authority to alter the terms of the Statement of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  Intent, Notice of Protest and Reservation of Rights, but he did not effectively alter such terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">5. There is an actual presently existing controversy between the plaintiffs and defendants, Wake Anesthesiology Associates, Inc., and Drs. Haynes, King and Schick, and declaratory relief is therefore an appropriate remedy as to those defendants and as to them only.  There is no actual presently existing controversy between plaintiffs and the remaining named defendants, and declaratory relief is therefore not an appropriate remedy as to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">6. Plaintiffs have not effectively cancelled their binder pursuant to the terms of the Statement of Intent, Notice of Protest and Reservation of Rights set forth in paragraph 8. Accordingly, the binder issued by plaintiffs to defendants Wake Anesthesiology Associates, Inc., and Drs. Haynes, King and Schick for the period October 1, 1975 to November 1, 1975 is still valid and in full force and effect.  The joining of these defendants on October 29, 1975 to these legal proceedings does not constitute notice of cancellation of defendants' coverage or adequate notice that the plaintiffs intend to exercise rights reserved in Statement of Intent, Notice&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  of Protest and Reservation of Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">7. The binder and Statement of Intent, Notice of Protest and Reservation of Rights, should be construed strictly against plaintiffs and in favor of the insureds and any ambiguities therein should be resolved in favor of the insured defendants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs appealed the judgment entered thereon adjudging that the binder issued to defendants Wake Anesthesiology Associates, Inc., and Drs. Haynes, King and Schick was valid and in full force and effect.  Plaintiffs also appealed the dismissal of their claim for declaratory relief against all other defendants.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the binder issued to Wake Anesthesiology Associates, Inc., and Drs. Haynes, King and Schick was void </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ab initio</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as an involuntary action and that whether plaintiffs took steps to cancel it was of no consequence.  As to the other defendants, the Court of Appeals reversed the judgment denying declaratory relief regarding the validity of the binder issued to the other defendants and, as to them, remanded the case for further proceedings.  Only defendants Wake Anesthesiology Associates, Inc., and Drs. Haynes, King and Schick appealed to this Court. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All matters concerning all other defendants are now before the trial court on remand from which no appeal was taken.  </SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the insurance policy contract, although written in reliance of the unconstitutional statute, was not automatically voided. The court balanced the equities of the situation and found that the policy was entered into voluntarily by plaintiffs. The court held that a subsequent contrary letter by an agent of plaintiffs defeated any reservation in the policy attempting to make the binder conditional upon the constitutionality of the statute. Therefore, the court reversed and remanded the decision of the appellate court and found that the insurance policy binder was valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court reversed the favorable ruling for the doctor, who claimed he was entitled to summary judgment based on the professional malpractice statute of limitations in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-15(c). The court held that the child's divorced mother had standing to bring the action for medical expenses and loss of the child's services allegedly resulting from injury caused by defendant's negligence. The court rejected the doctor's claim that only the father had standing to bring the claim. The mother had legal custody of the child and provided at least half his support. A new professional malpractice limitations period contained in &sect; 1-15(c) could not constitutionally be applied to bar the claim, because there was an eight-month period between the ratification date and the effective date of the provision. It would have provided the mother only 39 days in which to file her claim after she discovered it, which was not reasonable. Accordingly, the lower court erred in finding the claim barred under the new limitations period. Rather, the mother complied with the general limitations period in the statute by filing the action within three years of discovering the injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant accosted the victim in a parking lot and raped her. Defendant's defense was consent. Under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-58.6, the trial court refused to admit evidence that three different blood groupings of semen were found on the clothing the victim wore the night of the rape. Defendant argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it prevented him from automatically questioning the victim about her prior sexual experience, thus his right to confront the victim under U.S. Const. amend. VI was violated. The court disagreed. The court held that there was no constitutional right to ask the victim irrelevant questions. Second, in its impact and application, the statute was primarily procedural and did not alter any of defendant's substantive rights. Third, policy reasons supported the statute. Defendant's right to cross-examine the victim was not inviolate. The statute merely codified the rule that only relevant evidence was admissible.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff is a Delaware corporation which has its headquarters in Greensboro, N.C., with a place of business in Fayetteville, Cumberland County, N.C. Plaintiff owns personal property which is situated in Cumberland County and leases real property under an agreement which obligates it to pay all real property taxes on the leased premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 27 September 1976, the Fayetteville City Council, pursuant to G.S. &sect; 160A-24, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, adopted a resolution to consider the annexation of a certain area of land within which property leased by plaintiff and other commercial and industrial enterprises is located.  No residences are situated within the area.  The resolution scheduled a public hearing for 25 October 1976 at the Fayetteville City Hall.  Notice of the council's action was published in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">The Fayetteville Observer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on 28 September 1976, 5 October 1976, 12 October 1976, and 19 October 1976.  The hearing was held as scheduled and no opposition to the proposed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  annexation was voiced.  Accordingly, the area was annexed to the City of Fayetteville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 8 December 1977 plaintiff initiated this action seeking an injunction restraining the enforcement of the previously passed ordinance.  Plaintiff alleged that the annexation statutes under which Fayetteville proceeded were unconstitutional on their face and as applied because: (1) the applicable notice provisions of G.S. &sect; 160A-24 were insufficient to give parties affected by the annexation reasonable notice of the pendency of the action; and (2) the statute, which gives resident voters but not corporations in the area proposed for annexation a right to vote in a referendum on the proposal, denies plaintiff the equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within the time allowed, defendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, asserting that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, lack of subject matter jurisdiction, lack of plaintiff's capacity and standing to sue, laches, and equitable estoppel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 1 November 1978, the trial court entered judgment granting defendants' motion to dismiss on the grounds that the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and that plaintiff, as a corporate lessee, lacked standing to sue.  Plaintiff appealed from the judgment and defendants cross-appealed for failure of the trial court to grant the motion to dismiss on the other grounds upon which they relied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's ruling that plaintiff had no standing to sue.  It agreed with the trial court's rulings that plaintiff's equal protection and procedural due process claims failed to state claims upon which relief could be granted and affirmed the judgment dismissing the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff gave notice of appeal to this court and, in the alternative, petitioned us for discretionary review pursuant to G.S. &sect; 7A-31.  Defendants moved to dismiss plaintiff's appeal and petitioned for discretionary review of that part of the Court of Appeals decision holding that plaintiff had standing to sue.  We allowed plaintiff's petition and disallowed defendants' motion and petition.  </SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the dismissal of the corporation's complaint. The court held that the notice requirement was constitutionally adequate. The court held that the statute did not deny the corporation the equal protection of the laws because corporations were not a suspect class and the statute bore a rational relationship to a conceivable legitimate governmental purpose.

The issue was whether a jury instruction on the common-law presumption of the child's legitimacy violated defendant's right to a trial by due process of law where the effect of the instruction was to require the jury to find against defendant on the issue of paternity provided they found that the child was born during the couple's marriage. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that although there was some evidence that the mother had sexual relations with another man after conception and although the jury instruction placed too high a burden on defendant to rebut the presumption, defendant was not prejudiced by the error because there was no sufficient evidence to raise an issue of paternity and, thereby, rebut the presumption.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This case is before us upon petition by all parties to review judgment entered by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Judge McKinnon</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the Superior Court, Orange County, on 10 July 1979, prior to determination by the Court of Appeals.  The petition was allowed by order of this Court in Conference on 11 January 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In brief summary the facts pertinent to this litigation are as follows: Petitioners, the State of North Carolina and the University of North Carolina (UNC), appealed to the North Carolina Property Tax Commission (Commission) from an order by the Orange County Board of Commissioners and the Carrboro and Chapel Hill governing boards (respondents) requiring listing, valuation, and taxation of certain property belonging to UNC for the years 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973 and 1974.  The Commission determined that the property belonging to UNC was subject to ad valorem taxation unless used for public or governmental purposes as provided by G.S. 105-278.1.  The Commission then determined that all the properties listed by Orange County, Chapel Hill and Carrboro for taxation were exempt, except: (1) parcel 86-G-1, the Carolina Inn and the personal property used in its operations; (2) parcel 86-D-12, 13 and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  14, the first floor of the Hill Building; (3) parcel 29-1A, the portion of the airport property leased to the private airplane maintenance and repair firm and storage space rented to individual airplane owners.  The Commission held that the aforementioned properties were being used for commercial purposes which had no logical relation to the University's educational activities.  However, the Commission held these properties were to be taxed for the year 1974 only.  From this order all parties petitioned the Superior Court, Orange County, for further review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In considering the parties' petitions, Judge McKinnon found all of the Commission's findings of fact to be supported by substantial evidence and sustained them.  Based on these findings, he adopted the Commission's first four conclusions of law.  Judge McKinnon reversed that part of the Commission's conclusion number 5 involving the University's off-campus electric and telephone utilities, and the Horace Williams Airport, as arbitrary and not supported by substantial evidence in the entire record.  He therefore made the following conclusions of law: (1) that parcel 86-G-1, the Carolina Inn and the personal property used in its&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  operation, were subject to ad valorem taxation; (2) that parcel 86-D-12, 13 and 14, the first floor of the Hill Building, was subject to ad valoren taxation; and (3) that the off-campus University electric and telephone systems were subject to ad valoren taxation.  Judge McKinnon affirmed the Commission's conclusion of law that these properties were subject to taxation only for the year 1974.  From this judgment all parties appealed to the Court of Appeals, and we granted discretionary review prior to that court's determination.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners, state and university, sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court, Orange County (North Carolina), which affirmed the state tax commission's (commission) determination that several of the university's properties were subject to ad valorem taxation by respondent boards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The boards of the town and the county sought to tax certain real and personal properties owned by the university. The commission entered an order requiring listing, valuation, and taxation of the university's property. The superior court affirmed the commission's conclusion that the university's properties were subject to taxation. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the superior court's judgment. The court held that N.C. art. V, &sect; 2(3) prohibited the towns and the county from assessing ad valorem taxes against any property owned by the university regardless of the purpose for which the property was held. The court concluded that all property of the university was tax exempt due solely to its ownership by the state. The tax exemption followed by virtue of the property's ownership and occurred irrespective of the purposes for which the property was held. The court held that the North Carolina legislature clearly exceeded its authority in statutorily placing a public purpose requirement upon state owned property before exempting it from taxation. State owned property was exempt from ad valorem taxation solely by reason of state ownership, regardless of the property's use.</SPAN></P>

Judgments entered on 4 May 1979 and 8 July 1979 in Superior Court, Davidson County.  This case was argued as No. 116 at the Fall Term 1979.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 18 May 1977 defendant was arrested upon a warrant charging her with the murder of her sister, Minnie Lee Kiger, on 17 May 1977.  Minnie Lee Kiger died at 6:30 a.m. on 18 May 1977 as a result of multiple gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen inflicted upon her at 8:00 to 9:00 p.m. on 17 May 1977.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 19 May 1977 appointed counsel filed a motion suggesting defendant's mental incapacity to proceed to trial, and on that same date, defendant was committed to Dorothea Dix Hospital for observation and a determination of her mental capacity to proceed to trial.  After it was determined that defendant was mentally competent to proceed to trial she was returned to the custody of the Sheriff, Davidson County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 16 August 1977 appointed counsel filed notice of intent of the defendant to rely on the defense of insanity at the time of the alleged offense.  At the September 1977 Session of Superior Court, Davidson County, the grand jury returned a bill of indictment charging defendant with the first degree&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  murder of her sister, Minnie Lee Kiger, on 17 May 1977.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the 2 November 1977 Session defendant was brought to trial at which time she entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity.  During the course of the trial, upon motion of defense counsel, Judge Rousseau ordered a mistrial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was again brought to trial at the 12 December 1977 Session at which time she again entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity.  The jury found defendant guilty of first degree murder and a sentence of life imprisonment was imposed by Judge Mills.  Upon appeal this Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">State v. Leonard</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 296 N.C. 58, 248 S.E. 2d 853 (1978) ordered a new trial for error in denying defendant's challenge for cause to the three jurors.  This opinion was certified to the Superior Court on 18 December 1978.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again on 19 December 1978 appointed counsel filed a motion suggesting defendant's mental incapacity to proceed.  She was committed to Dorothea Dix Hospital for observation and evaluation.  On 13 February 1979 the hospital notified the court that defendant had been found competent to proceed to trial, and she was returned to the custody of the Sheriff, Davidson County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 30 April 1979 defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  filed a motion to dismiss the charges against her on the ground that she had been denied a speedy trial.  This latter motion was filed on the first day of the Session during which defendant was again tried for first degree murder.  The motion to dismiss was denied by Judge Long on 1 May 1979.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial the evidence for the State tended to show the following: On 17 May 1977 at about 8:00 to 9:00 p.m. defendant drove to the home of the deceased, defendant's sister.  As deceased walked out of the house and was approaching defendant's automobile which was parked in the driveway, defendant stepped out of her car and shot deceased five or six times with a .22 cal. rifle.  Defendant then backed out of the driveway and drove away.  It was stipulated by and between the prosecuting attorney and the attorney for the defendant, that Minnie Lee Kiger died as a result of multiple gunshot wounds in the chest and abdomen fired from a .22 cal. rifle.  When defendant was arrested at about midnight she was not interrogated.  However, after being transported to the sheriff's office, she asked the officer two questions: (1) &quot;How many times did I shoot her?&quot; and (2) if the State still had the death penalty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At trial the defendant's evidence tended to show the following: Defendant had a long history of mental disturbances.  She heard and talked with numerous voices, God, Satan, thunder, and others.  The voices, including God and Satan, sometimes told her what to do, and on occasion inflicted physical injury to her, such as cutting her and sticking her on the inside.  At the time of the shooting of her sister, God told her to do it.  Through the testimony of psychiatrists and others, defendant offered evidence that in 1972 she was diagnosed as chronic undifferentiated schizophrenic; that she knew she was shooting the gun and knew it was harmful; that as a result of her mental illness, she was not able to distinguish between right and wrong; and, that she believed what she was doing was right.  Defendant's evidence also tended to establish that she had previously been confined to mental institutions in Florida and North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury answered two special issues, finding (1) that defendant shot and killed Minnie Lee Kiger on 17 May 1977 and (2) that defendant was not insane at the time of the shooting.  The jury thereafter returned a verdict of guilty of first degree murder.  Judgment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of imprisonment for life was entered on 4 May 1979, and defendant gave notice of appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After judgment was entered, defendant in apt time filed a motion for appropriate relief in the form of a new trial alleging errors committed during the trial.  Defendant further alleged misconduct on the part of the prosecuting attorney in withholding from the court and defendant information in the possession of the prosecuting attorney that defendant had been acquitted of a charge of murder in the State of Florida on the grounds of insanity.  On 8 July 1979, after a plenary hearing, the trial judge denied defendant's motion for a new trial.  From this latter order, defendant gave notice of appeal.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant was not denied a speedy trial because, it was apparent from the history of defendant's involvement in the case, that the courts and mental institutions of the state were most generous with their time and facilities in according defendant all reasonable protections. Defendant's motion to dismiss was properly denied by the trial court as the state's evidence, by way of the testimony of two eyewitnesses, when viewed in the light most favorable to the state, was clearly ample to support a guilty verdict. The trial court properly permitted cross-examination of defendant for impeachment purposes concerning whether she shot and killed another woman years before the killing in question. The cross-examination of defendant with respect to her conduct in the shooting of the other woman was competent for the purposes of impeachment under the prevailing rules in the jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Applicant Broad and Gales Creek Community Association sought from the Department of Natural Resources and Community Development a permit to dredge and fill on Broad Creek for the purpose of constructing a boat launching ramp.  Pursuant to G.S. 113-229(d), a copy of the application was served on the owner of each tract of riparian property adjoining the property concerned in the application.  The two adjacent owners, Mrs. Nancy Fadum, a part-owner of Rugumak, Ltd., and Fred Cone, filed written objections to the granting of the permit.  In accordance with G.S. 113-229(e) the application was circulated among eleven state agencies so that they had an opportunity to raise any objections to the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  project that they might have.  After reviewing the project and conducting inspections, there were no objections from any of the state agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By letter dated 11 May 1976, Mr. Leo Tilley, Assistant Director of the Division of Marine Fisheries within the Department of Natural Resources and Community Development, informed the applicant that its request for the permit was denied.  The denial was based on G.S. 113-229(e)(2) which provides that, &quot;[t]he Department may deny an application for a dredge or fill permit upon finding: . . . (2) that there will be significant adverse effect on the value and enjoyment of the property of any riparian owners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to G.S. 113-229(f), applicant requested and received a hearing before the Marine Fisheries Commission. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Commission conducted a hearing, heard the evidence and entered its findings of facts and conclusions of law.  The Commission concluded that the denial of the permit was proper because the applicant, who had the burden of proof at the hearing, G.S. 113-229(g)(5), &quot;failed to show by the greater weight of the evidence that the permit denial by the department was not in accordance with the law and the facts.&quot;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 113-229, which allowed the Department of Natural Resources and Community Development (department) to deny a dredging permit to an applicant upon finding that dredging would adversely affect the value and enjoyment of the property of any riparian owners, was an unconstitutional use of the police power. The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstated the judgment of the trial court. The court held that: (1) if the legislature could use the police power to restrict the rights of an owner on his own land, the police power could be exercised to restrict an applicant's right to dredge and fill in estuarine waters that belonged to the public when the waters or adjacent private property would be adversely affected; (2) the means chosen to achieve the legislative objective, the permit application system created by &sect; 113-229, was the most feasible and reasonable manner to control dredging and filling activities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff from the decision of the Court of Appeals reported in 43 N.C. App. 553, 259 S.E. 2d 334, affirming summary judgment entered by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Albright, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 14 August 1978 Session of Guilford Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff filed this action on 8 August 1977 seeking a declaration that he had been illegally discharged from his employment with defendant's fire department.  He asked for reinstatement with restoration of back pay and benefits, plus costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pleadings, together with affidavits filed, tended to show the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff was employed by defendant as a fireman on 16 September 1974 and continued to be employed until his discharge on 2 June 1977.  On 2 September 1976, the City of Greensboro adopted an ordinance which required all employees residing in the City to continue to reside in the City limits.  The ordinance provided that employees then living outside the City could continue to do so.  At this time, fire department records showed plaintiff's address as 606 Fifth Avenue, Greensboro, North Carolina.  Shortly after the adoption of the ordinance, City employees were required to sign a form stating their current address and acknowledging the terms of the ordinance. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Plaintiff alleges that he requested an &quot;out of City&quot; form but was given an &quot;in City&quot; form instead.  He maintains that his residence was, at all times relevant to this action, in Surry County and that he gave his father's address in Greensboro to defendant merely as a matter of convenience.  In signing the &quot;in City&quot; form, plaintiff noted on it that he also resided in Surry County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November 1976, plaintiff requested that he be permitted to change his address form to reflect what he contended was his true address in Surry County.  He was informed that the ordinance prohibited such a change, and in early December received a letter from the Deputy Chief of the Fire Department denying his request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 29 December 1976, plaintiff purchased a mobile home at 4100 North O'Henry Boulevard, outside of the City limits of Greensboro.  In late May 1977, one of his superiors learned of plaintiff's new address.  Subsequently, the Assistant City Manager and the Director of Public Safety met with plaintiff, at which time he again contended that he had never been a resident of the City of Greensboro but only used his father's residence there as temporary quarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff received notice of and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  attended a departmental hearing on 31 May 1977.  On 2 June 1977, plaintiff received a letter from First Deputy Chief R. L. Powell, Jr., informing him that his employment with the Fire Department was terminated due to his moving his residence outside the City in violation of the residency ordinance.  On appeal to the City Manager, the decision to terminate was upheld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the institution of this action, defendant moved for summary judgment.  The trial court granted defendant's motion on 22 August 1978.  Plaintiff appealed and the Court of Appeals, in an opinion by Judge Robert M. Martin, unanimously affirmed.  Plaintiff appealed to this Court pursuant to G.S. 7A-30(1).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff employee, a city fireman, sought review of the judgment of the Court of Appeals (North Carolina), affirming the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant City of Greensboro (North Carolina) in employee's action seeking a declaration that he had been discharged from employment under a city residency ordinance in violation of his due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court affirmed as modified, holding that the employee was not denied the right to due process of law because the evidence clearly indicated that he received prior notice and hearing. The employee had standing to litigate the constitutionality of the ordinance because he suffered a direct injury from the ordinance's enforcement. The court held that, on its face and by plain terms, the ordinance section providing that the city manager was to implement the residency requirements did not vest unfettered discretion in the city manager. The denial of the employee's request to change his address form did not amount to enforcing the ordinance against him in an unequal manner compared with others similarly situated. Thus, the ordinance as applied to the employee did deny him equal protection. The determination of the departmental hearing board and the city manager that the employee had moved outside the city limits was binding on the court as an administrative decision. Moreover, the employee's terminable at will employment contract did not provide a sufficient proprietary interest to require full-scale constitutional protection in the form of a pretermination hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the summary judgment for the city as modified by its finding on the issue of standing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board of education had a policy of charging students instructional and course fees and of requiring students to furnish certain instructional materials and gym uniforms on their own. The fees were charged without ascertaining the financial status of individual students. Some exceptions were made on a case by case basis, but there was no uniform waiver policy or procedure. The trial court enjoined the board of education from requiring students to pay for certain services. The trial court found that the waiver policy was unconstitutional in that it failed to provide a uniform procedure whereby all students and their parents would be notified of the policy and could apply for the waiver. On appeal, the court held that the policy requiring students to pay supplementary school fees was not unconstitutional. The court found that so long as public funds were used to provide the physical plant and personnel salaries necessary for the maintenance of a general and uniform system of basic public education, the public school system was free and within the meaning of N.C. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2(1). However, the waiver policy was inadequate because notice was not provided to all students.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon pleas of not guilty defendant was tried on bills of indictment charging him with rape, kidnapping and two counts of crime against nature.  Collie R. Bond was the alleged victim of the crimes.  Evidence presented by the state is summarized in pertinent part as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Bond was a 62-year-old widow who lived alone in a house on West Rock Spring Street in Henderson, N.C.  She was employed as a reading coordinator by the Vance County School System.  At other times she had been employed as a reading teacher and a classroom teacher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 1:00 p.m. on Sunday, 1 April 1979, Mrs. Bond was returning from church services to the vicinity of her home.  She did not intend to go directly to her home, wishing instead to visit a neighbor who lived nearby.  As she neared her home, defendant approached her.  She was acquainted with defendant as he had done a number of odd jobs for her.  Mrs. Bond spoke to defendant and he asked her where she was going.  When she told him that she was going to Mrs. Talley's house, defendant told her that she was not, that if she went another step he would blow her &quot;damn brains&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  out&quot;, and that she was going into her house with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of her fear of defendant, Mrs. Bond went into the house with him.  He ordered her into a downstairs bedroom and told her to remove her clothing.  She tried to talk defendant out of harming her, telling him that she was an old woman and that a young man like him did not want an old woman.  Defendant told her that age did not make any difference to him, that he had &quot;experienced&quot; with virgins and with eighty-year-old women and that he had planned this occasion with her for a long time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mrs. Bond eventually removed her clothing, defendant removed his and got on the bed with her.  In spite of her continued pleas that he leave her alone, between then and around 5:00 p.m. defendant performed numerous acts of cunnilingus, vaginal intercourse and anal intercourse on the victim.  On one occasion he forced Mrs. Bond to perform fellatio on him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, at around 5:00 p.m., defendant allowed Mrs. Bond to put on a house robe for the purpose of going upstairs to the bathroom.  Instead of going upstairs, she went out the front door and to a neighbor's house where police were called.  When police entered the Bond home, they found&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant hiding in an upstairs closet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Bond was taken to the hospital where she was admitted as a patient and treated for several days.  In describing the Sunday afternoon ordeal, the victim stated that the anal intercourse was &quot;the most painful thing that has ever happened to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered evidence, including his own testimony, which is summarized in pertinent part as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the day in question he was 33 years old.  He lived on the same street as Mrs. Bond and had known her all of his life.  For several months prior to 1 April 1979, defendant had been employed by her to do various types of work in and around her home, including painting and carpentry, brick and yard work.  He worked short hours, mostly at night.  During the time he worked for Mrs. Bond they had several personal conversations, including talk regarding marriage.  He also ate several meals at Mrs. Bond's house and, although he had kissed her on several occasions, he never had sexual relations with her prior to 1 April 1979.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the afternoon of that date, he saw her walking out of her driveway.  He told her she was not going any place and she went with him into her home.  During the afternoon she&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  willingly undressed herself, he undressed himself, and they &quot;had oral, vaginal and anal sex.  She never said that she did not want to have sex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant admitted that he had been convicted of transporting tax-paid liquor, two counts of car theft, breaking and entering and fornication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found defendant guilty of second-degree rape, kidnapping and two counts of crime against nature.  The court entered judgments imposing prison sentences as follows: in one case of crime against nature, 10 years; in the other case of crime against nature, 10 years, this sentence to commence at expiration of the first 10-year sentence; in the kidnapping case, 80 years, this sentence to begin at expiration of sentence in the second crime against nature case; and in the rape case, life sentence to begin at expiration of sentence in the kidnapping case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant appealed from all judgments, and this court allowed motions to bypass the Court of Appeals in the cases in which less than life sentences were imposed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant State sought review of the decision of the Court of Appeals (North Carolina) that affirmed the granting of appellee religious organizations' summary judgment motion, and found certain aspects of the Solicitation of Charitable Funds Act (Act), N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 108-75.1 et seq. violated the N.C. Const. and the U.S. Const. in the organizations' action seeking to bar the application of the Act to their solicitation activities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The religious organizations argued that the Act violated the U.S. Const. and the N.C. Const. because it imposed more stringent recordkeeping and licensing requirements on certain religious organizations. The court affirmed the finding that the licensing requirements contained in &sect; 75.7(a)(1) of the Act, specifically N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 108-75.7(a)(1) effected an unconstitutional establishment of religion and was therefore, unconstitutional. The court noted that to pass constitutional muster, a statute had to pass a three-prong test: it must have a secular legislative purpose; its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion; it must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion. The court found that &sect; 75.7(a)(1) of the Act granted an exemption from the licensing and reporting requirements to a broadly defined class of religious organizations, but that the proviso which immediately followed denied the benefits of the exemption to those religious organizations which derive their financial support &quot;primarily&quot; from contributions solicited from persons other than their own members thereby eliminating its neutrality toward religion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Snepp, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judgment entered 7 December 1978 in Superior Court, Mecklenburg County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By indictments proper in form defendant was charged with first degree murder and with robbery with a dangerous weapon.  On pleas of not guilty the jury found the defendant guilty of first degree murder and of robbery with a dangerous weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdicts were returned the trial court ruled that the armed robbery conviction merged with the first degree murder conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter the question of whether defendant should be sentenced to death or to life imprisonment was submitted to the jury.  Upon the jury being unable to agree upon a sentence recommendation within a reasonable time the trial judge, pursuant to G.S. 15A-2000(b), sentenced defendant to the State's prison for a minimum and maximum term of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence for the State tended to show the following.  On the evening of September 4, 1977 the defendant and Andre Sharpe went to the home of the defendant's cousin Rick Fuller.  From Fuller they obtained a .22 caliber pistol and bullets.  At about 11:00 p.m. that evening the defendant and Sharpe visited the home of Ella Currance.  At the Currance residence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the defendant engaged in an argument where he fired three to five shells from the .22 pistol into the ceiling.  Following this altercation Sharpe and defendant Avery left the Currance's home and drove in Sharpe's car towards the Charlotte airport.  Near the airport the defendant got out of Sharpe's car for the purpose of stealing an automobile but for an unknown reason he did not do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometime between 4:30 and 5:00 a.m. on the morning of September 5, 1977, Sharpe and Avery returned to the home of Ella Currance.  There the defendant placed a call to Checker Cab Company and the dispatcher of the cab company dispatched Robert L. Moses in answer to the call.  After phoning for the cab the defendant and Sharpe left the Currance's home.  Having driven approximately two blocks, Sharpe pulled off the road, parked in a man's front yard and went to sleep.  Sharpe was awakened by the sound of a pistol shot and when he woke up he found the defendant was not in the car.  Sharpe drove towards the sound of the shot and arrived as the defendant was pulling Robert Moses onto the ground from the driver's seat of a Checker Cab.  Sharpe pulled up next to the cab and told the defendant &quot;let's go.&quot; The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant got into the car holding the .22 caliber pistol, a light blue jacket he had not had before and other articles of clothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence further tended to show that Robert Moses was shot to death in the back of the neck and head by bullets from a .22 caliber pistol which could have been fired from the .22 caliber pistol which was in the possession of the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After leaving the cab the defendant and Sharpe went to a house on Marene Avenue in Charlotte where the defendant told Sharpe that he twice shot the driver Robert L. Moses.  The defendant had a wallet containing Moses' driver's license and approximately $ 200 in cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 7, 1977 the defendant told John Lee Stewart, a friend of Sharpe's, that he had shot the cab driver in the head and neck.  On September 7, 1977 the defendant and Sharpe left Charlotte for New York City.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During voir dire the lower court struck for cause two jurors who indicated they thought they could not impose the death penalty. During the trial the state entered evidence that defendant left the state two days after the victim was shot. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that Negroes were an identifiable class and if a jury from which Negroes were systematically excluded because of their race convicted defendant, his conviction could not stand. It held that defendant was not entitled to a jury of any particular racial composition or that the jury actually chosen mirror the community. The court ruled that defendant did not present sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of systematic exclusion based on race in violation the Fourteenth Amendment and that defendant was tried by a jury composed of a fair cross-section of the community in compliance with the Sixth Amendment. The court held that the for cause excusal of the jurors was not improper and that the an identifiable group from the community was not improperly excluded by striking jurors who were opposed to the death penalty. It found sufficient evidence for the jury charge on flight and defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The primary issue on this appeal is a determination of the meaning of &quot;dependent spouse&quot; in our alimony statutes,&nbsp;G.S. 50-16.1&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We also address the issue of entitlement to counsel fees and other suit expenses in an action for permanent alimony.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff wife initiated divorce proceedings against defendant husband that sought temporary and permanent alimony, custody of the parties' children, and child support. The trial court awarded the wife alimony, counsel fees, and child support and custody. The North Carolina Court of Appeals reversed the orders for alimony and counsel fees and vacated and remanded the child support award. The parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the wife argued that she was the dependant spouse and thus was entitled to alimony as well as counsel fees. The husband argued that alimony would result in maintaining the wife's wealth, and not her living expenses. The court held that the appellate court did not apply the correct standard in determining whether the wife was the dependant spouse. Alimony should sustain the standard of living, to which the parties had become accustomed, for the dependant spouse. Therefore, the evidence clearly showed that the wife was the dependant spouse and thus was entitled to alimony. The only increase in the wife's wealth would be the result of inflation or prudent investments. The trial court's award of alimony as permanent lump sum alimony was error because periodic payments had been ordered. Attorney fees were not necessary to enable the wife to be on substantially even terms with the husband during litigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court's ruling that reversed the trial court's allowance of permanent alimony was reversed. That part of the trial court order for alimony referring to a &quot;lump sum&quot; payment was vacated. The appellate court's decision reversing the trial court allowance of attorney fees and &quot;necessary expenses&quot; was modified and affirmed. The case was remanded for a decision relating to child support.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tended to show that on the evening of 18 October 1975, defendant entered the B &amp; J Poolroom located at Tenth and Dawson Street in Wilmington.  Defendant was armed with an M-1 carbine rifle.  He ordered everyone in the poolroom to &quot;put their money on the table&quot; and &quot;get up against the wall.&quot; Defendant went through the pockets of some of the patrons while they were facing the wall.  During the course of the robberies, some shots were fired and two patrons were injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant did not testify and he called no witnesses in his behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found defendant guilty of the armed robbery of Alvin Nixon (No. 79CRS1870), Irving Green (No. 79CRS1871), Wilbert Rowell (No. 79CRS1876), Mike McRae (No. 79CRS1877), and Elton Williams (No. 79CRS1880) and guilty of assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury upon Alvin Nixon (No. 79CRS1875).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Claiming he had been singled out for prosecution, defendant produced statistics showing that others had charges dismissed when the prosecuting witness so desired. He argued he was denied due process when the trial judge refused to grant an evidentiary hearing on his motion to dismiss. The court found the contentions to be without merit. Even if all the other cases had been dismissed, defendant had not sufficiently alleged a denial of equal protection. He must have shown more than the fact that discretion was exercised by a district attorney in the application of a law resulting in unequal treatment among individuals. He must have shown that in the exercise of such discretion, there was intentional or deliberate discrimination. The hearing on the motion met the requirements of due process. Further, a right to such an evidentiary hearing was not inherent in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-954. The court held that during the statement of defendant's contentions, the trial judge did not erroneously assume that a fact in issue had been established. He merely sought to fully develop defendant's contentions so as to comply with a requirement that he give equal stress to the parties' contentions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged in an indictment, proper in form, with first-degree murder in the death of her husband, Don Gene Detter.  The primary evidence for the State was presented through the testimony of five lay witnesses and four doctors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joan Ladale Brooks, a friend and neighbor of the Detter family, visited the Detters in their home at 5301 Prince Charles Drive, Kernersville, in January, 1977.  During the visit, defendant mentioned how cruel her husband was to the family and stated that she had had something done to the brakes of her husband's car &quot;to either hurt him or harm him.&quot; In late January or early February, 1977, Brooks went with the defendant to the Crown Drug Store.  There, the defendant gave Brooks some money and asked her to purchase a bottle of Terro Ant Killer for her which Brooks did.  Dr. McBay, Chief Toxicologist of North Carolina, testified that one bottle of Terro Ant Killer contains 300 milligrams of arsenic.  A lethal dose of arsenic is between 100 milligrams and 300 milligrams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During this same period of time, Brooks accompanied the defendant to the home&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of James Thomas Holly, Jr. During the visit the defendant asked Holly &quot;what lead or lead poisoning would do to someone&quot; and &quot;where she could get some.&quot; Holly advised the defendant that lead &quot;would most likely kill somebody.&quot; After returning home, Brooks observed the defendant go to a storage area, get some lead weights from a fishing tackle box, place them in a cooking pot half full of water, boil it down so that there was only a few drops of water left, and then observed the defendant pour the drops of water into a liquor bottle.  Other evidence disclosed that the deceased was a heavy drinker and that he consumed three to four fifths of liquor per week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approximately one week later, Brooks observed the defendant pour the contents of a bottle of Terro Ant Killer into a glass of ice tea which defendant then gave to her husband which he drank.  On her next visit to the Detter's house, Brooks heard the defendant remark that she &quot;had asked her husband for a divorce and he wouldn't give her one . . . and she would be glad when everything was over and she wouldn't have to put up with Mr. Detter anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late March or early April, 1977, Brooks accompanied the defendant's son, Ted, to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Crown Drug Store, where he purchased two bottles of Terro Ant Killer which he then took home and gave to his mother.  On several occasions in the latter half of March, 1977, Brooks observed the defendant place Terro Ant Killer in ice tea and give it to the deceased.  On one occasion, Brooks observed the defendant pour Terro Ant Killer over a dish of ice cream and give the ice cream to the deceased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February, 1977, defendant and her son, Ted, visited Holly and defendant asked Holly if he &quot;would be interested in killing her husband for Five Thousand Dollars.&quot; Holly declined the offer.  On a later occasion Ted bought some &quot;PCP&quot; which is also known as &quot;Angel Dust&quot; from Holly.  Two weeks later defendant accused Holly of &quot;ripping her off.&quot; She stated that she put the drugs in her husband's food but they &quot;did nothing but make him happy.&quot; Defendant advised Holly that she wanted the drugs &quot;to kill her husband.&quot; Holly also sold the defendant some cocaine and some &quot;acid.&quot; Holly's wife testified that defendant asked Holly &quot;how could she kill somebody with a needle and air?&quot; Holly told the defendant that &quot;an air bubble . . . in your vein . . . could kill you instantly.&quot; On a later occasion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant told Holly that the drugs were not working and she did not understand why because she had placed the &quot;PCP,&quot; cocaine and &quot;acid&quot; in her husband's food and in his liquor.  Defendant stated that she was going to the Magic Market to meet someone &quot;who could help her&quot; and Holly did not see the defendant again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January, 1977, the defendant talked to Gregory Wayne Boyd and showed him a plastic bag which contained a pale brown powder.  Defendant asked Boyd if he thought the powder would kill her husband.  Defendant asked Boyd if he knew anybody who would kill her husband for five thousand dollars, and defendant offered to pay Boyd five thousand dollars if he would kill her husband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November or December, 1976, defendant met her hairdresser, Pamela Christy, at a restaurant in Kernersville for lunch.  During lunch defendant asked Christy if she or her husband could &quot;get some dope&quot; for her; that she wanted the dope &quot;to kill her husband.&quot; In January and February, 1977, defendant told Christy that she had put &quot;some stuff&quot; in her husband's food and he ate it but it didn't do anything to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deceased was hospitalized from 30 March 1977 until 13 April 1977 and from 17 May 1977&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  until his death on 9 June 1977.  During the first period of hospitalization, Dr. William Joseph Spencer tested deceased's urine for heavy metal poisoning and the results were negative.  Dr. Spencer's diagnosis was that deceased was suffering from &quot;peripheral neuropathy resulting from excessive alcohol intake.&quot; During the second period of hospitalization, Dr. Spencer noticed white lines across deceased's fingernails and he noticed a thickening of the skin over deceased's hands for which the medical term is hyperkeratosis, both symptoms of arsenic poisoning.  A test for heavy metal poisoning was positive and deceased was treated with British Anti-Lewisite, a drug to combat arsenic poisoning.  Dr. Spencer testified that arsenic poisoning is also a cause of peripheral neuropathy and in his opinion, as an expert in internal medicine, deceased died as a result of arsenic poisoning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. James Alvis McCool performed the autopsy on deceased on the day of his death.  Samples of hair, fingernails, bile, liver, blood, kidney, urine, stomach content and small bowel content were taken by Dr. McCool and mailed to Dr. Arthur J. McBay, Chief Toxicologist for the State of North Carolina.  Test results&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at the State Laboratory showed that these specimens from deceased's body contained approximately ten times the normal amount of arsenic.  In response to a hypothetical question, Dr. McBay stated that in his opinion deceased died of arsenic poisoning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant testified that neither she nor her son asked Brooks to purchase Terro Ant Killer or purchased any themselves.  On one occasion, Brooks and her son did go to the drugstore to pick up a prescription for her.  She never talked to Brooks about poisoning or wanting to kill her husband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant testified that she went to see Pamela Christy only to have her hair fixed; that she never stated to Christy that she wanted to kill her husband or wanted Christy or Christy's husband to buy drugs for her so that she could kill her husband; and that during her luncheon meeting with Christy at a restaurant they talked only about the defendant taking diet pills and not about her husband.  Defendant denied that she ever purchased drugs from Holly or solicited him to murder her husband.  She visited the Hollys in order to see their children and to attempt to get them to go to church.  She also denied talking to Boyd about lead poisoning or about&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  killing her husband and stated that she never tampered with the brakes on her husband's car or poisoned or drugged him in any way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She stated that her husband was a very heavy drinker and that she was told by Dr. Spencer that her husband suffered from peripheral neuropathy because he drank so heavily.  She was of the opinion that her husband somehow &quot;received arsenic at the hospital&quot; and that she &quot;suspicioned he may have committed suicide.&quot; Alma Bailiff, a registered nurse, testified that she entered a notation in the hospital records on 22 May 1977 that she heard the deceased repeatedly say, &quot;I did it and I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several witnesses acquainted with the defendant testified that they had never heard her talk of wanting to or trying to kill her husband and that they had never seen her put any poisons in her husband's food.  Also, several witnesses testified that the defendant had a good reputation in her community and in her church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the guilt-determination phase of the trial, the jury found the defendant guilty of first-degree murder.  At the sentencing phase, the jury found that the murder committed by the defendant was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel.  As a mitigating&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  circumstance, the State conceded and the jury found that the defendant had no significant history of prior criminal activity.  The jury found that the mitigating circumstance was insufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstance, and the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstance was sufficiently substantial to call for imposition of the death penalty.  The jury recommended the death sentence and pursuant to G.S. 15A-2002, the trial judge imposed that sentence.  Defendant appealed to this Court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During a time when the only penalty for first-degree murder was life imprisonment, defendant allegedly poisoned her husband by lacing his food and drink with arsenic. Yet, defendant's husband died shortly after a new death penalty statute became effective. Defendant appealed her first-degree murder conviction and death sentence. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that there was sufficient evidence of first-degree murder by means of poisoning to take the case to the jury. The court rejected every assignment of error related to the guilt determination phase of defendant's trial. Significantly, the court held that surreptitiously tape-recorded statements of defendant to informants were admissible because none of defendant's constitutional rights were thereby violated. No critical stage had been reached at the time the tapes were made so the Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not yet attached and there were no Fourth or Fifth Amendment violations. However, the death sentence was vacated because, for purposes of the prohibition against ex post facto legislation, the date(s) of the murderous acts rather than the date of death was the date the murder was committed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Wood, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 8 October 1978 Conflict Session, Halifax Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon pleas of not guilty, defendant was tried upon bills of indictment proper in form which charged him with robbery with a dangerous weapon and the murder of Wilbur Faulk Williamson.  The trial was conducted in the bifurcated manner mandated by G.S. &sect; 15A-2000 et seq.  Phase one of the trial determined the guilt or innocence of defendant.  Phase two of the trial was held to determine his sentence for first-degree murder following his conviction on that charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the guilt determination phase of the trial, the state introduced evidence summarized in pertinent part as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to 14 July 1978, Wilbur Faulk Williamson owned and operated a business known as the Gold Hill Grocery.  The store was located on North Carolina Highway 48 near Glenview, North Carolina, in Halifax County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 9:30 a.m. on 14 July 1978, Williamson was found by a passerby sitting in front of his store near a ditch.  Dressed in his underclothes, Williamson was bleeding profusely about his head as well as through his nose and mouth.  His clothing was soaked with blood.  Gurgling sounds in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Williamson's throat prompted Deputy Sheriff William T. Harper to clear an air passageway in Williamson's mouth and throat.  Williamson told those who had gathered about him that he had been robbed, but he was unable to supply any details of what had happened.  When a unit of the Roanoke Valley Rescue Squad arrived at the store, Williamson was sitting on the ground, propped up by a 55 gallon barrel that had been found nearby.  He was taken to Halifax Memorial Hospital in Roanoke Rapids where he later died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon securing the area detectives from the Halifax County Sheriff's Department proceeded to conduct an investigation.  From Highway 48 to the front of the store there was a trail of blood.  There was a pool of blood where Williamson had been sitting propped up by the barrel.  The trail of blood continued from the pool toward the store, going beside a set of gasoline pumps located in front of the store.  The trail of bloodstains led into the store itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The glass on the storm door on the front of the building had been knocked out.  Glass from the broken window littered the area in front of the store as well as an area immediately inside the front portal of the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interior&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the store was in disarray.  There was blood on the floor inside the store.  On the right just as one enters the store there was another pool of blood.  On the floor there was an oil can which had oil still running out of it.  Beside the can there was a pair of wire rimmed glasses.  Both the oil can and the pair of glasses were located at the base of a drink box.  The cash register was on the floor behind the counter.  It had not been opened.  There was a baseball bat lying beside the cash register.  On top of the counter there was a broken pair of sunglasses.  There was a shoe track on top of the counter in blood.  Throughout the store, there were bloody shoe tracks in the aisles.  There was blood on various items on shelves as well as on a freezer door whose glass had been broken out.  The floor of the grocery was wet from broken bottles of vinegar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At about the same time Williamson was found in front of his store, an orange Pontiac Firebird automobile was seen in the vicinity of the Gold Hill Grocery travelling at a high rate of speed.  At approximately 10:00 or 10:30 a.m. the automobile was involved in a traffic accident in Wilson, North Carolina.  The car was heavily damaged&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on the right side near the door and the right rear fender.  When he arrived on the scene Officer B. E. Edwards of the State Highway Patrol observed defendant sitting in the front passenger seat of the car.  Defendant was cut on his forehead and on his hand.  Defendant identified himself as the driver of the Pontiac saying that he had cut his head on the mirror and hurt his hand on the dashboard of the car.  Officer Edwards asked defendant if he would like to go to the hospital for treatment of his injuries.  When defendant replied affirmatively Officer Edwards directed him to go with Officer James H. Smith of the Wilson Police Department.  Officer Smith then took defendant to the emergency room of Wilson Memorial Hospital where his cuts were stitched and bandaged.  At the time he instructed defendant to go to the hospital with Officer Smith, Officer Edwards also asked him to go to the Wilson Police Department to fill out the accident report.  Defendant agreed that he would do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After providing for medical attention for defendant and asking him to go to the police station, Officer Edwards remained at the scene of the accident, on North Carolina Highway 58 south of Wilson, until a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  wrecker arrived to remove the automobile.  After the car was taken away, Officer Edwards left the scene and went to lunch, not knowing anything about the robbery of the Gold Hill Grocery or the killing of Williamson.  After he ate lunch and checked back onto the radio, he heard a highway patrol bulletin about the incident at the grocery.  He then returned to the place on Highway 58 where the Firebird had been sitting.  The patrolman searched the ditches along the road and in the wooded area nearby.  After searching approximately fifteen to twenty minutes, he found some clothing lying near a tree and a clump of bushes.  At trial Officer Edwards estimated that he found the items approximately fifteen steps from where the Pontiac had been parked.  He found a pair of fatigue pants with other items of clothing stuffed into one of the pant legs, including a pair of shoes as well as a tan and mustard colored shirt.  Upon touching the shirt Officer Edwards found that it bore bloodstains which were still wet.  Thereupon, he left the items where they were and went to his patrol car where he called for assistance from the Halifax County Sheriff's Department.  Officers from that department soon&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  arrived on the scene and were led to the items by Officer Edwards.  Photographs were taken and the items were removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of 14 July 1978 defendant was returned to Halifax County in the custody of Officer Warren and Sheriff William C. Bailey.  Before they removed defendant from the Wilson Police Department the officers advised him of his constitutional rights.  When they returned to the Halifax County Jail, the officers took defendant to Officer Warren's office for questioning where he then made a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his statement defendant stated that he and Tommy Boyd had left Maryland at approximately 2:00 a.m. on 14 July 1978 on a trip to South Carolina; that he was driving a 1972 orange Pontiac Firebird; that when the car began to run low on gasoline with them out of money they decided to find a place in the country to rob; that they stopped at a store (the Gold Hill Grocery); that they asked the man who was there to fill up their car; that Boyd had gone into the store with a baseball bat; that the man went inside also; he remained outside the store until he heard &quot;glass breaking and things falling . . . and Tommy calling&quot; for him; that he then ran inside the store where&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he saw Boyd and the man struggling; and that he ran between the two men and took the baseball bat away from them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant admitted further that he was driving the car when they left the store; that after the car was involved in an accident, he and Boyd went into some woods where they changed their clothes; and that they left the clothes which were bloody in the woods where they changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the interrogation defendant identified for the officers a number of items that had been taken from the store and recovered from the woods near where the Pontiac had been parked after the accident.  As well as identifying clothing and other items belonging to Tommy Boyd defendant proceeded to identify items which belonged to him: a shirt, a pair of pants, and a pair of shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state presented expert testimony of Dr. Page Hudson, Chief Medical Examiner of the State of North Carolina.  Dr. Hudson performed an autopsy on the body of Williamson and detailed the extent of the injuries he suffered in the incident at the grocery store.  He testified that the autopsy revealed that Williamson suffered from a very severe hardening of the arteries, and that there was evidence which indicated that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he had suffered a previous heart attack.  He further testified that it was his opinion that the lacerations and contusions which he found to be present on Williamson's body could have been caused by blows of a baseball bat; and that it was his opinion that the injuries which Williamson received would have enormously stimulated the heart and his blood pressure and that Williamson's death was accelerated by this stress.  On cross-examination the pathologist testified that Williamson's heart was &quot;in terrible condition.&quot; He stated further that any severe stress could have caused Williamson's heart to stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of the state's evidence defendant made a motion to dismiss.  Upon the court's denial of that motion, defendant took the stand on his own behalf against the advice of his attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant testified generally consistently with the statement he had given to the officers.  His testimony differed from his statement in that he testified that Boyd suggested that they rob a store but that defendant told Boyd that he &quot;knew better, but we were both together and he knew what he could do.&quot; Defendant denied having hit Williamson with the baseball bat, insisting that he went into&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the store to separate Williamson and Boyd as they fought over the bat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of attempted armed robbery with a dangerous weapon as well as first-degree murder in the perpetration of a felony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court then proceeded to conduct the sentencing phase of the trial before the same jury pursuant to G.S. &sect; 15A-2000 et seq. to determine if defendant's sentence on the murder conviction would be death or life imprisonment.  The state offered as evidence additional testimony by Officer E. C. Warren, Chief Investigator for the Halifax County Sheriff's Department.  Officer Warren testified only to the physical characteristics of defendant.  Defendant again took the stand on his own behalf against the advice of his attorney.  Defendant testified that he did not feel that he had gotten a fair trial, saying that he had tried to help Williamson, not hurt him, when he went into the store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to aggravating circumstances, the jury found that the murder was committed while defendant was attempting to commit a robbery that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel.  The jury found only one mitigating circumstance -- that defendant had no significant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  history of prior criminal activities.  It further found that while the mitigating circumstances were insufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstances, the latter were not sufficiently substantial to call for the imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury recommended that a sentence of life imprisonment be imposed.  Pursuant thereto the court entered judgment providing that defendant be imprisoned for life, that sentence to run concurrently with another life sentence which had already been imposed upon defendant upon his conviction of attempted armed robbery.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;In defendant's trial and the judgment entered for first-degree murder, we find no error.  In the armed robbery case, the judgment is arrested.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Halifax Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted him of robbery with a dangerous weapon and first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of robbery with a dangerous weapon and first-degree murder in connection with the shooting death of a business store owner. The jury recommended that a sentence of life imprisonment be imposed. Defendant sought review contending that the trial court erred in admitting opinion evidence that prints from his shoes were found near the crime scene, in denying his motion for nonsuit because the state failed to establish a causal relationship between the assault and the death, in failing to instruct the jury on lesser included offenses that were raised by the evidence, and in failing to arrest judgment entered on the conviction of attempted armed robbery. The court found no error in defendant's conviction and sentence for first-degree murder, holding that an expert witness was not required to testify as to the identification of shoe prints and that there was no requirement that a trial judge state the contentions of the litigants. The court arrested the judgment of conviction for armed robbery because it merged into the first-degree murder charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On appeal as a matter of right pursuant to G.S. 7A-30(2) from a decision of the North Carolina Court of Appeals finding no prejudicial error in the proceedings before </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Pfaff, Judge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Juvenile Session, District Court, Guilford County on 5 July 1978.  Court of Appeals' decision, one judge dissenting, is printed at 40 N.C. App. 423, 252 S.E. 2d 854 (1979).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A juvenile petition was filed on 7 June 1978, alleging that the child was delinquent as defined by G.S. 7A-278(2) in that he committed armed robbery, a violation of G.S. 14-87, on 8 May 1978.  The child at that time was a 13-year-old male.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the child was tried only for the allegation noted above, and appeals from the finding of delinquency therein, it is apparent from the record before us that the child was alleged to have committed several serious delinquent acts during early May, 1978, and that he had a long record of juvenile delinquency.  For a full understanding of this decision, it is necessary to summarize the entire record before us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record discloses that several motions were filed on behalf of the child prior to 7 June 1978, the date this petition was filed.  On 26 May 1978, counsel for the child filed a motion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for a lineup alleging that a petition had been filed against the child on 11 May 1978 alleging the child to be delinquent for committing the crime of robbery on 10 May 1978.  The motion was filed by Wallace C. Harrelson, Public Defender of the Eighteenth Judicial District.  The motion alleged that counsel had been &quot;led to believe&quot; soon after his appointment that the child was &quot;probably&quot; not guilty of any delinquent act but that another individual was &quot;probably&quot; responsible for the charge against this child.  Further, that counsel then contacted Judy W. Allen, a detective with the Greensboro Police Department, advised her of his concern and requested her to further investigate the case.  It was, the child's counsel alleges, at that time agreed between Detective Allen, an assistant district attorney, and counsel for the child that a lineup would be conducted on 16 May 1978 in which the child would participate.  However, subsequent to that conversation and prior to 15 May 1978 (and unknown to the child or his counsel) Detective Allen took photographs of the respondent and others and showed the photographs to the alleged victim of that crime, Genelia Breedlove.  Upon contacting Detective&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Allen on 15 May 1978, counsel was advised that no lineup would be held since the detective had shown the victim photographs of the child and that he had been identified by the victim.  The motion then prayed that an order be issued requiring the State to conduct identification procedures as provided by G.S. 15A-281.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 6 June 1978, counsel for the child filed another motion and this time alleged that the child had been charged with the following deliquent acts: (1) larceny on 2 May 1978, (2) armed robbery (the present charge) on 8 May 1978 and, in the same petition, crime against nature on 10 May 1978, and (3) larceny on 3 May 1978 and the taking of personal property on 2 May 1978.  It was then alleged that all of the petitions noted above were contained in the same file in the office of the Clerk of Superior Court of Guilford County and that such filing of allegations had previously been held to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 7 June 1978, Judge Gentry entered an order finding that the child was charged with various petitions noted above and that they were kept in the same file bearing the heading of &quot;Juvenile Petition or Motion for Review.&quot; The trial court entered findings of fact and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  conclusions of law and ordered, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that (1) the petitions against the child be dismissed, (2) that should the district attorney desire to file new petitions for these same charges, only the word &quot;petition&quot; should appear on the new documents, (3) that any and all charges which might be brought against the child be in separate petitions and in separate file folders, (4) that no numbering system on any new charges should be used which would in any way indicate that the child had a previous record within the juvenile court of the Eighteenth Judicial District, (5) that any new petitions be forwarded to the chief district judge for hearing by him or some other judge assigned by him to hear such petitions, and (6) that under no circumstances should any petitions other than new petitions filed in accordance with this order be transferred to the chief district judge and that a copy of the order not be transferred to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 15 June 1978, another order was entered by the district court extending the previous order to include other charges pending in the child's file.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, on 7 June 1978, a new juvenile petition was obtained in the case at bar, a summons was issued, and the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  child was ordered detained for five days.  On 8 June 1978, the public defender was appointed to represent the child.  The child's detention order was extended pending hearing on the delinquency petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 15 June 1978, the public defender filed a motion for severance of offenses.  He listed offenses noted above and, in addition thereto, the charge of rape alleged to have been committed by the child on 10 May 1978, the motion noting that a separate motion had been filed in which the child moved for dismissal since he was only 13 years of age and was, under the law of the State of North Carolina, incapable of rape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on 15 June 1978, the public defender filed a motion to suppress identification.  This motion disclosed that pursuant to the district court order noted above the child had been charged in new petitions with the following charges in addition to that at bar: (1) Crime against nature on 10 May 1978, (2) rape on 10 May 1978, (3) larceny on 2 May 1978, (4) armed robbery on 10 May 1978, (5) larceny on 3 May 1978, and (6) armed robbery on 8 May 1978.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This motion alleged that the Greensboro Police Department violated G.S. 15A-502(c) in taking photographs of this 13-year-old&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  child.  It also alleged that actions of Detective Allen, in showing photographs of the child, had unnecessarily tainted the identification by the alleged victims if they had in fact identified the child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 3 July 1978, an order ruling on these motions was entered in open court.  The court ordered, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that (1) a 13-year-old child cannot be charged with the crime of rape in North Carolina, (2) the child was entitled to have the petitions tried and adjudicated separately from each other, (3) the motion for different trial judges for each petition was reserved pending the particular judge's determination as to whether a fair trial could be held and (4) the child's statement was suppressed on the ground that the child was made to believe that he had been abandoned to the police by hostile and nonsupportive parents and that police had not obtained an affirmative waiver of child's right to counsel.  The court reserved ruling on the motion to suppress the identification.  The court's findings of fact indicated that the child had been apprehended by Detective Allen, was placed in handcuffs and taken to the Greensboro Police Department at 9:40 p.m. on 10 May 1978.  The parents&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  stated in the presence of the child that they wanted nothing further to do with him, and that the police could take him because they &quot;knew that he would steal.&quot; The child remained at the police station until 11:30 p.m. when he signed the police waiver form and was then questioned by Detective Allen until approximately 1:30 a.m. Detective Allen did advise the parents and the child of their constitutional rights but at no time asked for or received an affirmative waiver of the child's right to an attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the delinquency hearing on this armed robbery petition on 16 June 1978, counsel again moved to suppress the identification of the child by the prosecuting witness, Mrs. Maude Vaden, prior to any evidence presented by the State.  Evidence at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tended to show:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Allen testified that she did exhibit several photographs, including this child's, to Mrs. Vaden; that Mrs. Vaden identified the child upon reaching his photograph in the group of pictures; that Mrs. Vaden stated she had known the child's mother since before he was born and that she had &quot;sold Mrs. Vinson the sheets that was used when Jerry was born;&quot; that she didn't know him by name but knew he was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. and Mrs. Vinson's child.  On cross-examination the detective stated that she was aware of the State law preventing the photographing of children but she &quot;did it anyway;&quot; that the usual procedure of the Greensboro Police Department is to photograph only the juveniles involved in serious offenses; that she recalled talking to the public defender about a lineup but did not recall agreeing to one on any particular date.  On redirect she stated that she considered she had authority to take the photographs pursuant to a Greensboro City Ordinance; and that Captain S. B. Simpson had told her the city ordinance would supersede the State statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Vaden testified that she had known the child's parents for 20 or 25 years; that she had seen the child at his home; that he had been to her house twice; that he came to her house and beat her over the head so that it was difficult for her to remember anything; that she did select the child's picture from the group given to her by Detective Allen; that she later went to a lineup at the police department and identified the child from the group.  On cross-examination Mrs. Vaden was shown the respondent and testified, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as follows: &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  <BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">He looks exactly like the boy but I was thinking he was a little bit taller than that but I think that was the boy.  I am not sure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">. . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Well, if that is the boy, it is not him.  It is his brother but --.  Yes, the Vinsons have several children.  Some of them are about the same age and they look very much alike.  I am not sure that this is the boy.  His hair is different or something.  Some changes have been made in him, if it is him.  I am not sure that it is him.  But it's bound to be his brother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">. . . .</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following this </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> testimony, the court denied the child's motion to suppress Mrs. Vaden's identification on the ground that the identification was made from prior knowledge of him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court then proceeded to hearing.  Mrs. Vaden testified that the child came to her door on 10 May 1978 and told her that he wanted a drink of water; that she took him down the hallway, went to the refrigerator and gave him a glass of water when her phone rang; that she went to answer the phone and left some money on top of the refrigerator; that it was gone the next day and no one had been in her kitchen but him; that as she went to the living room, the child&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  pulled her over in front of the fireplace and tied a dish towel around her eyes and pushed her over and beat on her and hit her on the head; that he took her down the hallway to her bedroom and threw her down on the bed and &quot;pulls my clothes, dress over my face and removed the rest of it and I [kept] kicking and kicking and pushing him away from me;&quot; that &quot;he tried to compel me and threatened killing me unless I used my mouth, if you know what I mean;&quot; that when he first started abusing her, he made her give him $ 200.00 from her pocketbook; that he put something cold next to her head and told her that it was a gun and that if she screamed or told anyone he would kill her and started beating on her again; and that she fell to the floor unconscious.  When she woke up, he was gone.  He had on &quot;what boys that age ordinarily wear, but he unzipped his pants and pushed them down over his knees and his underwear;&quot; that he cut her telephone line with a pair of scissors.  Mrs. Vaden's testimony concerning the identification of the child at hearing was essentially the same as that adduced on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Child's counsel moved for nonsuit which was denied.  Child presented no evidence. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The trial court adjudicated the child delinquent for committing the acts alleged in the petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court then inquired of counsel if he was ready to proceed with the disposition stage of the hearing.  The public defender replied that he would like to produce information from a mental health clinic but that it was not ready at that time.  Counsel also objected to the trial court's considering any accusation at disposition for which there was no adjudication of delinquency.  The trial court, however, proceeded to the disposition hearing and specifically asked the district attorney, &quot;[H]ow many matters have been retained by the Greensboro Police Department regarding Jerry Vinson?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assistant district attorney then told the court of the various charges pending against the child including assault, larceny and receiving.  The court inquired about another rape charge and was told it had been dismissed.  The court was also advised that the child had been previously placed on probation.  Detective Allen told the court the statements made to her by the child concerning his sexual acts with Mrs. Vaden and Mrs. Breedlove.  The court was further advised that the child had been&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  adjudicated a delinquent for glue sniffing by a previous judge.  The public defender once again unsuccessfully requested the trial court for an opportunity to send for people from the mental health center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of this, the trial court ordered:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">On disposition, I am going to find that the child's behavior constitutes a severe threat to the persons and property in this community; that there is no community based resources including community based residential care which would be successful considering the nature and severity of the offenses committed and likewise that he could not adjust in his own home or on probation and I am going to commit him to the Department of Human Resources . . . and order that he not be released prior to his 18th birthday.  I am going to order that they give him any and all necessary psychological counselling and treatment while he is there and pending his being transported to the appropriate facility by the Court Counsellor he is to remain in the custody of the Court.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A written commitment order was entered accordingly.  In the written order, the court entered findings of fact &quot;that the child began committing sexual assaults at&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  age 9; that he has continued to commit crimes of a sexual nature including the rape and attempted rape of elderly women; and that he is a dangerous and vicious sex offender, despite his being only 13 years of age.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following entry of the foregoing judgment, the child entered notice of appeal to the North Carolina Court of Appeals and the public defender was appointed to represent him on appeal.  The Court of Appeals found, one judge dissenting, only that Mrs. Vaden's identification of respondent was sufficient to survive nonsuit.  The Court of Appeals did not address the procedural irregularities brought forward on this appeal.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Reversed.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant juvenile, who was 13 years old, was adjudged delinquent under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-278(2) and committed for placement in a state training school. The North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed. The juvenile appealed as a matter of right pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-30(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court correctly dismissed the rape charge because a 13-year old could not commit the crime of rape. The court held that line-up photographs of the juvenile were taken illegally under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-502; however, the victim's identification of the juvenile was made on the basis of her prior knowledge of him, not on the basis of the photographs. The trial court erred in denying the juvenile's motion for nonsuit or dismissal, because the state's evidence created only a suspicion that the juvenile had committed the charged act. The victim, an elderly lady, indicated serious doubt and some confusion as to whether it might have been one of the juvenile's brothers. The trial court's denial of the juvenile's request to stay disposition for a psychological report that was already being created was not so irregular as to be improper under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-285. The trial judge erred in considering nonadjudicated matters reaching back to the time the juvenile was nine years of age. The better practice would be to limit consideration of past delinquent acts in a dispositional hearing to those which have been adjudicated or, at the very least, formally petitioned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decision of the appellate court and the trial court, which adjudged the juvenile a delinquent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent Taylor Tobacco Enterprises, Inc., is a North Carolina corporation and is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of North Carolina (&quot;OSHA&quot;), G.S. &sect;&sect; 95-126 to -155, and is subject to administrative inspection thereunder pursuant to G.S. &sect; 95-136.  On 29 December 1977, respondents refused to submit to a warrantless inspection of their premises by agents of the North Carolina Department of Labor.  On 21 March 1978, an administrative inspection warrant was issued and properly served on respondents at the situs of the corporate respondent.  Upon service of the search warrant, the individual respondent, while acting in his capacity as an officer of the corporate respondent, stated to the OSHA inspectors present that he would prevent them from inspecting the premises and acted in such a way as to lead the inspectors to reasonably believe that force might be used if they attempted to conduct the inspection purportedly authorized&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the warrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On its face the warrant indicated that it was based on &quot;probable cause to believe that violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act . . . are present at the situs of the property described above.&quot; It directed authorized agents of the North Carolina Department of Labor &quot;. . . to inspect the property described in the attached affidavit to determine the presence of violations, if any, of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of North Carolina and regulations promulgated thereunder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 24 March 1978 the Department of Labor filed a petition in Bladen Superior Court seeking an order directing respondents to show cause why they should not be held in civil contempt of court for refusing to honor the administrative inspection warrant.  Judge Giles M. Clark found probable cause to believe that respondents were in civil contempt of court and directed them to appear for a hearing on 10 April 1978.  At that hearing, Judge Herring denied respondent's motions to dismiss, for summary judgment, and for judgment on the pleadings.  After hearing evidence in the case, Judge Herring entered judgment holding both respondents to be in civil contempt of court, assessing a $ 500&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fine to each, and ordering them to submit to an administrative inspection within ten days of entry of judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following a second trial by jury in the Randolph County Superior Court (North Carolina), defendant appealed his conviction of second degree murder and his sentence of life imprisonment. In a first trial in another county, he had been convicted of murder in the first degree and sentenced to death. The court had found no error, but the United States Supreme Court vacated the court's judgment and remanded. Upon remand, the court ordered a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant testified that he had received orders to kill his father from someone who had control of him. Defendant contended on appeal that the judge in the second trial erred in placing the burden on him of proving the affirmative defense of insanity to the satisfaction of the jury. The court, however, found no error in the jury instructions. There was no due process requirement that the burden of disproving insanity, or proving insanity, was to have been placed on the State. Despite defendant's argument that policy required a change, the court declined to change the long standing common law rule that the burden of proving insanity was properly placed on a defendant in a criminal trial. As to other alleged errors in the instructions, including those on voluntary manslaughter, the court concluded that any error committed could not have prejudiced defendant in light of the evidence adduced and the verdict rendered. Although the instructions on voluntary manslaughter were admittedly confusing, possibly due to transcription errors, they were not prejudicially erroneous. There was no evidence that defendant acted either in the heat of passion on adequate provocation or in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court overruled defendant's assignments of error relating to the disputed portions of the jury instructions. Accordingly, the court found no error in the trial court's rulings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was indicted and convicted of two counts of assault with a firearm on a law enforcement officer and one count of armed robbery, second offense.  The charges were consolidated for judgment and defendant was sentenced to imprisonment for the term of his natural life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence for the State tended to show that at approximately 1:30 p.m. on 27 October 1978, a black male entered the offices of C &amp; S Finance Services Company in Charlotte wearing a navy blue toboggan, sunglasses, a light-colored smock over a dark sweater and blue and white checked polyester pants.  The man stated that he wished to apply for a loan and was told to wait until the office manager, Reid W. Carter, could speak with him.  When Carter was able to talk, some ten minutes later, the robber went into Carter's office, pulled a handgun and herded Carter and another employee, Don Bowen, out of their cubicles into the outer office where the cashier, Mary Ann Le Carpentier, was sitting.  When Ms. Le Carpentier saw the robber pull his gun, she hit a silent alarm button&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under her desk.  Lester Horton, a customer of C &amp; S who had been sitting in Bowen's office, was told to remain where he was by the gunman.  He did so and observed subsequent events from this inner office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At gunpoint, Carter gave the robber approximately $ 300.00 out of the office cash drawer.  When the robber threatened to kill Ms. Le Carpentier, Carter and Bowen gave him money from their billfolds.  Le Carpentier, Carter, Bowen and Horton all identified defendant as the robber.  Le Carpentier, Carter and Bowen remembered him as a previous customer of C &amp; S Finance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 1:40 p.m., Officer J. D. Ensminger received a call on his car radio that a robbery was in progress at C &amp; S Finance.  He proceeded in that direction, parked his car in front of the business, got out and approached the front door.  He saw a black male standing inside the office with his back to the officer and his arms forward.  The man spun around to his left, came &quot;centerways into the door,&quot; brought his snub-nose revolver down, and pointed it at the officer.  Shouting &quot;Freeze,&quot; he fired one shot from about a three foot distance at Ensminger.  Ensminger turned and ran along the side of the office building while the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  gunman fired a second shot at him.  Ensminger then circled the building and saw a black male wearing a white top, blue toboggan and sunglasses run across the street.  As the officer followed this man, he saw another policeman, K. D. Helms, drive up in a patrol car.  Officer Ensminger went on, rounded another building on foot, and saw a bluish-gray Camaro angle parked behind that building.  A man wearing a blue sweat suit with red stripes and a toboggan was about 40 feet away from the car.  Next to the car, standing at the left rear, was a man with a snub-nose revolver in his hand.  Ensminger saw this man squat down behind the quarter panel of the Camaro and aim in the direction of Officer Helms who had just driven around in the patrol car.  Ensminger cocked his revolver and aimed at the back of the gunman's head but apparently did not shoot.  The gunman got into the driver's door of the automobile and Ensminger dodged behind a car approximately two spaces north.  The gunman fired his weapon at Officer Helms.  As Officer Helms returned the fire, Ensminger, unobserved by the gunman, moved against the wall of a building some 18 feet away and fired three times at the suspect.  The person&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the Camaro looked over at him and they, too, exchanged shots.  Ensminger was wounded in the exchange.  Officer Helms then fired a shotgun at the car and the suspect's body slumped over the steering column and rolled out onto the pavement.  After waiting two or three minutes, the officers went up to the person who had fallen from the car and found him to be the defendant, Thomas Lee Dunlap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A .38 caliber revolver with five spent rounds, a pair of blue and white checked pants, a ski mask and a jacket with $ 327.00 in the pocket were recovered from the car.  Testimony indicated that the defendant had once been employed at the Radisson Plaza Hotel as a cook.  The smock-type jacket and trousers used in the robbery and found inside the Camaro were the same uniform items worn by cooks at the Radisson when defendant worked there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A certified copy of defendant's prior conviction of armed robbery in Richmond County was also entered into evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant testified that he did not rob the C &amp; S Finance Company, but that he had been napping in his car when another man ran up and threw the clothes and other things into his car.  He admitted he had been convicted of armed robbery in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Richmond County.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Mecklenburg County Superior Court (North Carolina) in which he was convicted of two counts of assault with a firearm on a law enforcement officer and one court of armed robbery, second offense, in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-87. He also appealed his sentence of imprisonment for the term of his natural life. He contended the trial court erred in denying his motions to suppress identification testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">All three witnesses identified the robber as someone they had seen before. The court on appeal rejected defendant's contentions, including that in which he claimed that pretrial publicity tainted the identification procedures. Holding that defendant was not denied a fair hearing on his suppression motions, the court found that the trial court conducted a lengthy voir dire hearing before entering its conclusions that each witness had ample and sufficient opportunity to see, observe, and know defendant as a customer of the store prior to the robbery. Further, their in-court identifications were based on their independent knowledge of defendant. The court applied a five-factor analysis in reaching its determination that the photographic lineup procedures were not impermissibly suggestive; for example, the length of time between the crime and the confrontation was brief. Accordingly, defendant's motion to suppress the identification testimony was properly denied. The court held that &sect; 14-87(b), which provided for sentencing without parole, was not unconstitutional. Finally, the sentence of life imprisonment, as set forth in &sect; 14-87(a), did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found no error in the guilt determination. The court remanded the case to the trial court for clarification of the sentence, however, because it was not certain that the trial court intended to impose a life sentence without the benefit of parole. As a result, the trial court may have imposed a longer sentence than it intended.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the military personnel's search to secure defendants' belongings was analogous to the search and seizure permitted of impounded vehicles and thereby did not violate defendants' Fourth Amendment rights; (2) military authorities did not violate the Posse Comitatus Act, 18 U.S.C.S. 1385, because their passive activities which incidentally aided civilian law enforcement were not precluded under &sect; 1385; and (3) defendants were not denied a fair trial by the joinder because the conflict between each defendant's testimony was not of such magnitude, in the context of other evidence, that the jury was likely to infer from that conflict that both were guilty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c1"><SPAN CLASS="c4">November 6, 1979, Filed </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defendant was charged with first degree murder, first degree rape and first degree burglary of an 86-year-old woman.  He received two consecutive life terms upon </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">negotiated pleas of guilty</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to second degree murder, first degree rape and first degree burglary.  Sentence was imposed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Judge Seay</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the 6 November 1978 Special Criminal Session of Superior Court, Caswell County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to trial, defendant moved to suppress certain evidence and a confession he made to the police.  At the suppression hearing before Judge Kivett at the 19 June 1978 Session of Caswell County Superior Court, the State presented several witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence for the State</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caswell County Deputy Sheriff O. A. Worsham testified that he was on duty as a radio dispatcher on 11 September 1977 when he received a call at 2:12 a.m. The caller stated that he was defendant, Johnny Reynolds, and said that he needed an officer.  The caller said that he had been coming down the road by his house, thought he heard an elderly neighbor, Mrs. Lula Stephens Thompson, holler and had gone up to her house.  He said it appeared to him that Mrs. Thompson was unconscious or dead in the house.  Worsham told the caller&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to stay right there and the sheriff's office would send out an officer.  Worsham testified that the caller talked intelligently and &quot;plain,&quot; and gave directions to his location.  A Deputy Gwynn, who apparently knew defendant as a friend, also spoke with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">S.B.I. Agent S. A. Pennica testified that he arrived at the crime scene about 4:30 a.m. and noticed defendant asleep in the back seat of one of the patrol cars.  Pennica had no discussion with defendant at that time and went on into the Thompson house to conduct his investigation which he concluded at approximately 10:40 a.m. that morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agent Pennica's next opportunity to observe the defendant was at the Caswell County Sheriff's Office in Yanceyville at approximately 11:50 a.m. At that time he saw defendant in the holding cell of the jail.  Soon after he arrived, Agent Pennica witnessed S.B.I.  Agent Childrey advising defendant of his rights and saw defendant sign a waiver.  Agent Childrey, Agent Pennica and the sheriff, who were all present, identified themselves to defendant as investigators of the crime.  Defendant had not been told prior to questioning that he was a suspect in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agent Pennica testified that defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appeared to be alert and awake during the initial questioning and acted concerned about what the investigation had shown.  Defendant was dressed in blue jeans with no shirt or shoes on and had scratches and bruises on him.  Pennica did not smell the odor of alcohol on defendant's breath and defendant did not appear to him to be overly upset, though &quot;a little nervous.&quot; No offer was made to call an attorney for the defendant but later on an offer was made to call a family member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pennica advised the defendant that he was not required to give hair samples but requested permission to obtain them anyway.  Defendant replied that this would be &quot;fine,&quot; so Pennica took the samples.  Pennica also asked if defendant would submit to having blood drawn and defendant consented.  Before either the hair was taken or the blood drawn, defendant was told about the physical findings at the scene and told what use would be made of the samples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one told defendant that if he told the truth and cooperated that this would be disclosed in court or that it would help clear his conscience.  After approximately 40 minutes, defendant made a taped statement after having been reminded of his rights for the second&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was fingerprinted and photographed and his pants were taken after the interview was completed around 2:30 p.m. The blood sample was drawn at 3:00 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State's third witness, S.B.I. Agent Thomas C. Childrey, testified that he was in charge of the investigation and first spoke to the defendant at 11:58 a.m. in the sheriff's office.  At that time he advised defendant of his constitutional rights.  Defendant signed a statement indicating that he understood his rights and that he did not want a lawyer.  Defendant was again advised of his rights at 12:40 p.m. Defendant indicated again that he understood his rights and that his original waiver was still in effect.  No promise of leniency was made to defendant.  At 11:58 a.m., when defendant was first advised of his rights, he was told that he was suspected of murder and later in the interview was told that it would be possible that the charges against him would be first degree murder, first degree burglary and rape.  Agent Childrey did not take defendant to a magistrate before questioning him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence for the Defendant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant testified on his own behalf that he was 25 years old, was involved in logging work and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  lived with his stepmother.  He said he drank heavily during the week leading up to 11 September 1977 and did not recall making a phone call to the sheriff's office but had been told that he had done so.  He did recall seeing Deputies Graves and Gwynn the morning after the crime.  The officers came to his home on that date and took him to Mrs. Thompson's house.  Once there he got out of the car and started toward the dwelling, but one of the officers told him not to come to the house.  He was asked to get back into the car and did so.  He assumes he then went to sleep and did not get up until the next morning, after daylight.  He asked what he was doing there and did not get an answer, &quot;but I didn't go anywhere because I was under the impression that I could not go anywhere.&quot; When he woke up, one of the officers was standing up against the front of the car.  No one said anything to him while he was in the car and he felt miserable when he woke up from the heavy drinking.  No one said that he was under arrest and he does not recall asking if he could leave.  After they left the Thompson house and started to Yanceyville, he asked Officer Gwynn if he would stop at a store so that he could&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  get milk and cigarettes.  Officer Gwynn did so, and defendant entered the store unaccompanied to make his purchases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After defendant arrived at the sheriff's office around 10:00 a.m. one of the officers told him that he could sit in the holding cell because there was a bench or stool there that would be comfortable.  Defendant went in and sat down and someone closed the door and he said they locked it.  They later brought him a mattress and a sheet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When taken into the sheriff's office, defendant said he was not told that he was a suspect in the case, but he was told he had a right to a lawyer.  He was shown a piece of paper and signed it.  He was told that he had made a phone call to the sheriff's department that night and was told what he had said during the call.  He was shown a shirt, and was asked if it was his.  He was told the shirt was found at the crime scene.  He recalls police asking for his hair and blood samples but does not recall his response.  He recalls mentioning &quot;something about having an attorney present&quot; but said he was told that he had signed a waiver with respect to a lawyer.  He said he was led to believe that police would be easier on him if he cooperated. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He was not taken before a magistrate until around 2:30 or 3:00 p.m. and was never told that he had the right to communicate with family or friends.  The magistrate did not indicate that he had a right to communicate with counsel.  He did not realize what he was being charged with until he received copies of the warrants.  He first saw a lawyer the following day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several other witnesses testified that defendant had been drinking heavily up until around midnight on the evening in question and had engaged in a fight.  A psychiatrist testified about defendant's mental condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant also called Deputy Sheriff Graves who testified that at about 3:30 a.m. he and Deputy Gwynn were directed by the sheriff to go to the home of defendant, about a mile and a half from the crime scene, and pick him up.  Defendant was in the house and came to the door when the deputies blew their horn.  The defendant got into the unlocked back seat and they all went to the Thompson house.  The deputies did not ask defendant any questions, but immediately upon entering the car, he spontaneously started speaking.  He told them he had heard a noise from Mrs. Thompson's house while passing by and went to see&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  what had happened.  Her door was locked so he pulled a screen off, went in a window and saw someone lying on the floor.  He said he came out, ran the mile and a half home, and called because he did not want anyone to think he had done something wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After this volunteered comment, deputies and defendant arrived at the Thompson house.  The deputies got out of the car and the defendant lay down and went to sleep in the back seat.  During the night, the deputies were out in the yard at different places and at times were in the house, but Deputy Graves specifically stated that &quot;nobody was definitely watching and assigned to keep an eye on [defendant].&quot; After finishing their work at the crime scene, deputies were instructed to bring defendant back to Yanceyville, get him something to eat and &quot;put him up&quot; until the sheriff and the S.B.I. arrived.  &quot;As to whether he was free to walk home at the time we left the scene . . . [n]obody said nothing about him walking home.&quot; In Yanceyville defendant was not taken to a regular lockup but was shown to a holding cell.  Defendant was not arrested at the time he was with Deputy Graves.  Deputy Graves did not suspect defendant, nor had the sheriff&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  said anything about defendant being a suspect.  Defendant was simply considered the only source of information about the crime since he had reported discovering the victim's body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graves further testified that after arriving at the Thompson home, no one said anything to the defendant about restricting his movements in any way.  The car was never locked.  Defendant asked if it would be alright to go to sleep and was told that it was.  Defendant complained that it was cold so the deputies rolled up the windows and he went to sleep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Explaining the stop for cigarettes at the convenience store, Graves said no one attempted to restrict defendant's movements in any way.  Defendant was not asked questions by anyone during the time he was in the car at the Thompson house or while en route to Yanceyville.  As they were driving toward Yanceyville, defendant asked if they thought he had done it and was told only that &quot;the sheriff might want to talk with him later as he was the only man that saw it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the sentencing hearing, the testimony of S.B.I. Agent Childrey revealed that the defendant made, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the following disclosures to the officers at his interview which was transcribed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from the tape recording: That he went in Mrs. Thompson's house and started &quot;messing&quot; with her; that she tried to hit him with a flashlight and he took it away from her and wrestled with her; that he didn't know when she was dead but it scared him and he ran home and called the sheriff's department; that he thinks he had intercourse with her and that she was alive at the time; that he might have choked her; that too much drinking caused him to do this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trial Court Order</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Kivett, in a lengthy and detailed order denying the motion to suppress, found and concluded, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as follows: (enumeration ours)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) That the sheriff and other investigators considered defendant the only source of information available to them in connection with the investigation and defendant was transported to the Thompson home for the purpose of being available to provide further information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) Defendant made a voluntary statement but he was not considered a suspect at the time by the deputies and had been picked up only at the request of the sheriff so that he might possibly provide additional information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) That while in the sheriff's car at the Thompson home for several hours, his&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  movements were not restricted and he was not suspected at that time because the investigation had not progressed far enough; that he slept in the back of the sheriff's car from approximately 3:30 a.m. until approximately 9:00 a.m. the next morning.  At approximately 10:00 a.m., he was transported to the sheriff's office &quot;to make him available for providing additional information to the sheriff if the need should arise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) That no promises were made to defendant to induce him to waive his right to have an attorney; that he was not coerced in any way and that he did freely, voluntarily and understandingly answer questions of an incriminating nature to the officer conducting the interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(5) That, after he made the first statement which the State proposed to offer at trial, following the advisement of his constitutional rights and his waiver to have a lawyer present and his waiver to remain silent at approximately 11:58 a.m., the investigating officer reiterated certain rights and defendant reiterated that he understood them and did not want an attorney present and that he consented to a tape recording being thereafter made of any answers he might give in the interrogation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(6) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That defendant was clearly in control of his faculties at the time and understood the nature of the inquiry being made and of his rights under the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(7) That he freely and voluntarily and understandingly waived his right to have an attorney present and waived the right to remain silent and other rights under the law and that he freely and voluntarily gave his statement to the interrogating officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(8) That none of defendant's rights under Chapter 15A of the General Statutes were violated and that specifically with respect to G.S. 15A-511 and G.S. 15A-501, defendant made no showing that he was not taken before a magistrate &quot;without unnecessary delay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(9) That defendant was not placed under arrest until sometime later during the morning of 11 September 1977 and that until the time that the sheriff and the two S.B.I. agents began their interview, defendant was free to leave the dispatcher's room and the sheriff's office at the Caswell County Jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(10) That even if the arrest had actually occurred at an earlier time, it was necessary for the officers to proceed further with the investigation before they had an opportunity to return to the sheriff's office to make further inquiries&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(11) That none of defendant's rights under either federal or state constitutions were violated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(12) That defendant's statements were freely and voluntarily made and defendant was told by the officers that they were asking for samples of hair from his person and blood from his body so that comparison tests might be made and that he knowingly and intelligently and voluntarily decided to cooperate with the officers and to voluntarily give samples or permit them to be taken for the purposes stated by the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court then denied defendant's motion to suppress the statements and the samples taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Kivett's order is dated 22 June 1978.  Thereafter, on 7 November 1978, Judge Seay conducted a sentencing hearing at which time much of the evidence summarized above was again introduced.  Defendant entered a negotiated plea of guilty and sentence was imposed as hereinabove indicated.  Immediately after the sentence was entered, defendant gave notice of appeal with respect to the denial of his motion to suppress and moved for the court to provide a transcript of the suppression hearing, a transcript of his sentencing hearing and moved for appointment of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  counsel to prepare the notice of appeal.  Judge Seay held that the pleas of guilty entered for defendant were negotiated pleas, that defendant stated in open court that the negotiated plea set forth in his transcript of plea contained the entire plea arrangement and that defendant had accepted the arrangement with no mention to the court concerning an appeal.  Judge Seay concluded that by entry of the negotiated pleas, the defendant waived any right of appeal that he might have had in regard to the motion to suppress in these cases.  He therefore denied defendant's motions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant thereafter petitioned this Court for certiorari which was allowed on 6 February 1979 on the basis of G.S. 15A-979(b) which provides: &quot;An order finally denying a motion to suppress evidence may be reviewed upon an appeal from a judgment of conviction, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">including a judgment entered upon a plea of guilty</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot; (Emphasis added.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our consideration, therefore, is whether Judge Kivett properly denied defendant's motion to suppress.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of his conviction in the Caswell County Superior Court (North Carolina) for second degree murder, first degree rape, and first degree burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After pleading guilty to second degree murder, first degree rape, and first degree burglary of an 86 year old woman, defendant challenged his conviction on grounds that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress a confession given to police after he was taken into custody. On appeal, the court found that defendant's confession was not the result of an illegal arrest because defendant initiated contact with the police and voluntarily accompanied the police for the purpose of providing additional information, there was no physical coercion by the police at any time, the police had developed adequate probable cause to suspect defendant of the crimes as a result of their investigation before questioning him, and he was advised of his rights before questioning commenced. The court further ruled that defendant, who did not give notice of any intention to the prosecutor or court that he intended to appeal from the denial of his suppression motion pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-979(b) before the plea negotiations were finalized, had effectively waived his rights under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for second degree murder, first degree rape, and first degree burglary, ruling among other things that defendant waived his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress evidence by failing to notify the prosecutor and court of his intention to appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">McKinnon, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 27 November 1978 Special Criminal Session, Bladen Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity, defendant was tried on a bill of indictment which charged her with the murder of Stewart Taylor.  The trial was conducted in the bifurcated manner mandated by G.S. &sect; 15A-2000 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Phase one of the trial determined the guilt or innocence of defendant.  Phase two of the trial was held to decide her sentence for first-degree murder following her conviction on that charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the guilt determination phase of the trial, the State introduced evidence summarized in pertinent part as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to January 1978, defendant and Stewart Taylor had been going together.  On occasion, defendant stayed with Taylor at his home in St. Pauls, North Carolina.  At the time of his death, Taylor was fifty-six years old.  He had been in fairly good health until the evening of 31 January 1978, four days before his death.  On that evening, defendant and Taylor went to Fayetteville to attend a gospel sing.  While at the performance, Taylor became ill.  The couple left and returned to St. Pauls.  At approximately 2:30&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the following morning, Taylor began vomiting and having diarrhea.  He continued to be ill throughout the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the next day defendant took Taylor to Southeastern General Hospital in Lumberton where he was treated.  At the time he was examined by an emergency room physician, Taylor was complaining of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, as well as general pain in his muscles, chest and abdomen.  His blood pressure was low.  His pulse was weak and rapid.  He was dehydrated and his skin was ashen in color.  After receiving intravenous fluids and vitamins, as well as other treatment, Taylor was released from the hospital and defendant took him back to his home in St. Pauls where she fed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day, 3 February 1978, an ambulance was summoned to Taylor's home.  The attendants found him to be in great pain.  His blood pressure was very low, his breathing was rapid, and his skin was gray.  During the trip to the hospital, Taylor was restless and moaning.  While he was in the emergency room, he was given intravenous fluids.  A tracheotomy was performed but he died in the emergency room approximately one hour after he was brought in.  One of the attending physicians, Dr. Richard Jordan, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was &quot;not satisfied&quot; as to the precise cause of death.  After talking with two of the attending physicians, members of Taylor's family requested that an autopsy be performed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The autopsy was performed by Dr. Bob Andrews, a pathologist.  During the course of the autopsy, toxicological screenings were performed on samples of Taylor's liver and blood.  Though the normal human body contains no arsenic in the blood or in the liver tissue, Taylor's blood was found to have an arsenic level of .13 milligrams percent.  His liver had an arsenic level of one milligram percent.  These findings led Dr. Andrews to conclude that Taylor died from acute arsenic poisoning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 10 March 1978, Robeson County Deputy Sheriffs Wilbur Lovette and Al Parnell talked with defendant at the Sheriff's Department in Lumberton.  After having been given her </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings, defendant executed a written waiver indicating that she understood what her rights were and that she was willing to make a statement as well as answer questions without the presence of an attorney.  The conversation between defendant and the deputies related to a number of checks that had been forged on the account of Stewart Taylor.  During&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the interview, the officers produced a check dated 31 January 1978 in the amount of $ 300.00.  Defendant stated that she had seen the check before; that she had cashed the check; and that while she had &quot;filled out&quot; the check it was signed by Taylor himself.  While she talked with the officers, defendant produced two checks from her pocketbook which were dated 4 November 1977 and 23 November 1977.  Both checks were drawn on Taylor's checking account and were payable to her.  They were in the amounts of $ 100.00 and $ 95.00, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State introduced evidence obtained through handwriting analysis which tended to show that the three checks were not written by Stewart Taylor; and that the checks had been cashed by defendant at a branch of First Union National Bank in Lumberton.  During the interview with the deputies, defendant denied that she had forged any checks on Taylor's account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was asked by the officers if she knew the cause of Taylor's death.  Upon being told that the autopsy had indicated that arsenic poisoning was the cause of Taylor's death, defendant began crying, stating that &quot;You all think I put poison in his food.&quot; She then proceeded to deny that she&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was in any way involved with Taylor's death.  After making that denial, defendant was taken home.  The investigation continued through the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, 13 March 1978, defendant returned to the sheriff's department accompanied by her son, Ronald Burke.  After she was again advised of her constitutional rights, she executed another written waiver.  She then made a lengthy statement in the presence of Deputies Lovette and Parnell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her statement, she admitted that before 1 January 1978 she had forged some checks on Taylor's account which he found out about when his bank statements came in the mail; that upon finding out about the forgeries, Taylor talked with her and threatened to &quot;turn her in&quot; to the authorities; that she forged another check on Taylor's account on 31 January 1978; that the forgery bothered her because Taylor would find out about it; that on that day, she and Taylor went to Lumberton because she had an appointment with her doctor; that after they left the doctor's office, they stopped at a drug store ostensibly for her to purchase some hair spray; that instead she purchased a bottle of Terro Ant Poison; that the next day, 1 February 1978, she put some of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  poison in Taylor's tea at lunchtime; and that later that same day, she put more of the substance in Taylor's beer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant told the officers that she felt sure that what she had done was wrong but that she had not told anyone at the hospital about it on the two occasions that Taylor had been taken there for treatment.  She stated that she gave Taylor the poison because she was afraid that he would &quot;turn her in&quot; for forgery.  She further stated that she used the money she got out of the 31 January check to pay bills for doctors and medicine.  She concluded by confessing that she had given poison to other persons besides Taylor and that they too had died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Lovette then advised defendant that there was a possibility that a number of bodies would be exhumed.  He asked her if arsenic would be found in the bodies.  When she answered affirmatively, Deputy Lovette asked her in which bodies arsenic would be found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant admitted that while she lived and worked in the home of John Henry Lee as a housekeeper and nurse's aide in early 1977 she found a checkbook for an account in the joint names of Lee and his wife, Record; that she wrote a check on the account in the amount of $ &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  50.00; that Mr. and Mrs. Lee found out about the forgery and asked her about it; that she then purchased a bottle of poison, pausing to read the label which said &quot;May be fatal if swallowed&quot; and that she gave Mr. Lee poison three times -- once in his tea and twice in his coffee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state introduced other evidence which tended to show: On or about 28 April 1977 Mr. Lee, 80 years old, became ill.  Until then he had been in good health and attended to numerous chores around his home.  On 29 April 1977, he was taken to the hospital complaining of vomiting and diarrhea.  Though he was released from the hospital on 2 May 1977, he continued to be ill throughout the month of May, complaining of vomiting, diarrhea, and general pain through his body.  On 3 June 1977, he was taken to the hospital again where the attending physician, Dr. Alexander, observed that he was critically ill.  Deep blue in color, his skin was cold and wet with perspiration.  He was confused and unresponsive and his blood pressure was subnormal.  On 4 June 1977 he died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though no autopsy was performed at the time of Mr. Lee's death, his body was exhumed pursuant to a court order on 18 March 1978 and taken to the office&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Chief Medical Examiner in Chapel Hill where an autopsy was performed.  Toxicological screenings revealed that the liver contained an arsenic level of 2.8 milligrams percent and the muscle tissue contained an arsenic level of 0.3 milligrams percent.  Dr. Page Hudson, Chief Medical Examiner of the State of North Carolina, testified that in his opinion Mr. Lee's death was caused by arsenic poisoning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant admitted to the officers that she had poisoned Mrs. Dolly Taylor Edwards; that in early 1976 she moved into the home of Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery Edwards in Lumberton as a live-in helper; that Mr. Edwards died on 29 January 1977; that in late February 1977 she drove to St. Pauls where she purchased a bottle of poison; that she noticed on the bottle the words &quot;Could be fatal if swallowed&quot;; that returning home she put some of the poison in Mrs. Edwards coffee and cereal; and that shortly afterwards Mrs. Edwards became ill, suffering from nausea and general weakness in her body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state introduced evidence that Mrs. Edwards was taken to the hospital on 27 February 1977, was treated and released.  Her condition did not improve and she was again taken to the hospital on 1 March&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1977 where she died later that evening.  The attending physician, Dr. Henry Neill Lee, Jr., testified that Mrs. Edwards was dehydrated and suffered from nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her statement to the deputies, defendant said that she knew that the poison was responsible for the death of Mrs. Edwards; that after Mrs. Edwards died, she threw the bottle of poison into a field behind the Edwards residence; and that she did not know why she gave the poison to Mrs. Edwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Lovette testified that during the course of his investigation he went to the field behind the Edwards home and found an empty bottle of Singletary's Rat Poison which still bore the original label.  He initialed the bottom of the bottle and kept it in his sole possession until the time of trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though no autopsy was performed on the body of Mrs. Edwards at the time of her death, pursuant to a court order, her body was exhumed on 18 March 1978 and sent to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Chapel Hill where an autopsy was performed.  During the autopsy, toxicological screenings were conducted on samples of Mrs. Edwards' liver tissue and muscle tissue.  In the liver tissue, there was found an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  arsenic level of 0.4 milligrams percent.  In the muscle tissue, there was found an arsenic level of .08 milligrams percent.  Dr. Page Hudson testified that in his opinion Mrs. Edwards' death was caused by arsenic poisoning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant further admitted in her statement to the deputies that she had poisoned her mother, Lillie McMillan Bullard; that during 1974 she lived with her mother in Parkton, N. C.; and that while she lived with her mother she forged her mother's name to a note in favor of the Commercial Credit Company of Lumberton.  (Other testimony indicated that the note was in the amount of $ 1,048.00.) She further told the deputies that she was afraid that her mother would find out about the note; that she bought a bottle of poison and the bottle bore the warning &quot;Can be fatal if swallowed&quot;; that one day at dinnertime she put some of the poison in some soup and a soft drink and gave both to her mother; that later in the evening on the same day she gave her mother a soft drink which contained a dose of the poison; that Mrs. Bullard began to vomit and have diarrhea; and that she was taken to Cape Fear Valley Hospital in Fayetteville on 30 December 1974 where she died shortly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  after her arrival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attending physician, Dr. Weldon Jordan, testified that Mrs. Bullard was restless and gasping for breath when she was brought into the hospital; that she was in shock; and that he was unable to discern any blood pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the death of Mrs. Bullard, an autopsy was performed with the permission of her family, including defendant.  No toxicological screenings were conducted at that time.  Pursuant to a court order the body of Mrs. Bullard was exhumed on 18 March 1978 and taken to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Chapel Hill.  Dr. William Frank Hamilton testified that he performed toxicological screenings upon samples of hair, muscle tissue and skin which had been taken from the body; that the hair sample revealed an arsenic concentration of .6 milligrams percent; that the muscle tissue had an arsenic level of .3 milligrams percent; that the skin sample had an arsenic level of .1 milligrams percent; and that in his opinion, Mrs. Bullard's death was caused by arsenic poisoning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although defendant did not admit any involvement in the death of her husband, Jennings L. Barfield, his body was exhumed pursuant to a court order on 31 May 1978.  It was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  taken to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Chapel Hill where an autopsy was performed.  Toxicological screenings indicated that varying levels of arsenic were present in his body tissue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Neil A. Worden testified that he treated Mr. Barfield when he was brought to the emergency room of the Cape Fear Valley Hospital in Fayetteville on 22 March 1971.  At that time Mr. Barfield complained of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and aching throughout his body.  Mr. Barfield had been brought to the emergency room for the first time at about 11:00 p.m. on 21 March 1971.  At that time he was treated and released.  However, he returned to the hospital at 5:00 the next morning at which time he was given intravenous fluids.  By the time that Dr. Worden first saw him at about 8:00 a.m., Mr. Barfield was in shock; his blood pressure was low; his pulse was rapid; and his complexion was ashen.  Dehydrated and gasping for air, Mr. Barfield appeared to Dr. Worden to be in great pain.  Dr. Hamilton testified that the cause of Mr. Barfield's death was arsenic poisoning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of the state's evidence, defendant made a motion to dismiss.  Upon the court's denial of the motion, she presented&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  evidence which tended to show:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the month of January 1978 defendant was under the care of five doctors none of whom knew she was under the care of the others.  She had been seeing the doctors for some time and had obtained prescriptions for a number of drugs from them.  Among the drugs she was taking at that time were: Elavil, Sinequan, Tranxene, Tylenol III, and Valium.  She had a history of drug abuse and had been admitted to the hospital at least four times for overdoses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two doctors, Dr. Arthur E. Douglas and Dr. Bob Rollins, testified that it was their opinion that while defendant was prone to abuse prescription drugs she was sane at the time of the death of Stewart Taylor, as well as at the time of trial.  Though he declined to render an opinion as to defendant's sanity, Dr. Anthony Sainz, testifying by way of a deposition, agreed with the observations of Dr. Douglas and Dr. Rollins that there was no evidence that defendant suffered from any mental illness.  Dr. Sainz also agreed with the conclusions of the other doctors that defendant was competent to stand trial and participate in her own defense.  All of the doctors agreed that defendant knew the difference between&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  right and wrong.  Dr. Douglas and Dr. Rollins concluded that defendant had a passive-dependent type of personality whereas Dr. Sainz felt that she had a passive-aggressive personality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant took the stand on her own behalf.  Her testimony was generally consistent with the statements she gave to Officers Lovette and Parnell.  She admitted to poisoning Stewart Taylor, John Henry Lee, Dolly Taylor Edwards and her mother, Lillie McMillan Bullard.  She had no recollection of what happened with regard to the death of her husband, Jennings L. Barfield.  She stated that on 31 January 1978, the day she allegedly administered poison to Taylor, she took a quantity of medication at about 11:30 a.m.: three Sinequans, three Elavils, six Valiums, and four Tranxenes.  She further stated that she was taking her medication in double doses in late January and early February 1978.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant admitted that she had poisoned Dolly Taylor Edwards, but said that she could not offer any explanation as to why.  She gave her reasons for poisoning Stewart Taylor, John Henry Lee and Lillie McMillan Bullard.  As to Taylor, she stated that she had forged a check on his account.  Fearing that Taylor would &quot;turn&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  her in&quot; for forgery, she gave him Terro Ant Killer thinking it would make him sick.  In regard to Lee, though her recollection was vague, she recalled that she had written a check on his account because she needed the money to pay for drugs, the same reason that she wrote checks on Taylor's account.  In the case of her mother, defendant stated that she had forged the note at Commercial Credit Company because she needed the money to pay for drugs and visits to her various doctors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of the first-degree murder of Taylor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court then proceeded to conduct the sentencing phase of the trial before the same jury pursuant to G.S. 15A-2000 et seq. to determine if defendant's sentence on the murder conviction would be death or life imprisonment.  The state offered no additional evidence.  Defendant presented evidence which tended to show that prior to the death of her first husband in 1969 she did not abuse prescription drugs; following his death, however, she underwent a change in attitude and demeanor which was reflected in a pattern of drug abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issues as to punishment were submitted to and answered by the jury as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  Do you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the following aggravating circumstance(s) exist?<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that (1) the trial court did not err when it excluded jurors who would not vote to convict the defendant if conviction meant the imposition of the death penalty, (2) evidence that defendant had committed four other murders was relevant to establish motive, intent, and existence of a plan or design to commit the offense charged, (3) under the totality of the circumstances, defendant's confession was voluntary, (4) the trial judge did not err in failing to place the issue of insanity before the jury because there was no evidence to support that defendant was insane at the time of the offense, and (5) the North Carolina death statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Principal evidence against defendant was provided by Annie Lois Goins Shamback (Lois) who testified under a grant of immunity pursuant to G.S. 15A-1052.  In return for her &quot;truthful testimony&quot; against Charles D. Goins and defendant, the state agreed to dismiss charges against her relating to the murder, robbery and kidnapping of Lester Collins.  (Charles D. Goins was tried prior to the date of defendant's trial.) Her testimony is summarized in pertinent part as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of defendant's trial (October 1978) she was 23 years of age and had been married approximately six months.  She had two children that were born prior to her marriage.  Charles Goins (Charles) was her brother and Collins was married to her sister.  On 2 July 1977 her sister was a patient at Dorothea Dix Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 2 July 1977 she and her young son lived with defendant at Lumberton, N.C. She and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant were not married to each other but had lived together for approximately 18 months prior to said date.  Charles had been staying with them for about a week, his home being near Fayetteville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late in the afternoon of said date she, defendant and Charles went to Fayetteville in her white 1968 Ford Fairlane.  Their destination was Charles' home but they stopped at a bar in East Fayetteville, went in, and defendant and Charles &quot;had a few beers&quot;.  When they returned to the car they discovered that a C.B. and scanner belonging to defendant had been taken from the car while they were in the bar.  Defendant had reason to believe that Magaline Tyler's brother was one of the persons who stole the C.B. and scanner and insisted on going to her house which was not far from the bar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When defendant, Lois and Charles left the bar, defendant was driving.  After driving a short distance in the neighborhood, defendant and Charles got out of the car and told Lois to circle the area while they looked for the person or persons who stole the equipment from the car.  After circling for some 30 minutes, Lois drove the car to Magaline Tyler's home.  Defendant came out of the house and Collins was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  following him, asking defendant to take him home.  At first, defendant refused, but Collins kept on asking and eventually defendant said he would take him home.  Collins had been drinking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant got under the wheel, Collins got in the backseat and Lois and Charles rode on the front seat.  Defendant was quite angry about his C.B. and scanner being stolen and was also angry with Lois for circling so long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant then drove the car down Cedar Creek Road east of Fayetteville to Lois' mother's home which was also Charles' home.  When they arrived there, Charles went into the house to get some clothes.  Collins remained in the backseat of the car and wanted defendant to carry him back to Fayetteville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four of them left the Goins home and were situated in the car in the same positions as when they arrived there.  They proceeded to drive down Cedar Creek Road and while riding Charles leaned over and whispered something to defendant.  Defendant then turned the automobile down a dirt road, went to the end of it and turned around in the direction of Cedar Creek Road.  It was then &quot;way after dark&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant stopped the car on the dirt road and got out.  He told Collins to get out. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defendant had a gun and as Collins got out of the car, defendant hit Collins on the side of his head with the gun.  Collins told defendant he hadn't done anything, but defendant hit him again with the gun, bringing blood from Collins' face.  Charles and Lois remained in the car while defendant and Collins went behind the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the two men reached the rear of the car, Lois saw Collins advancing on defendant and then heard three shots fired.  Before the shots were fired, Lois could not see what Collins was doing to defendant, &quot;just his body going toward&quot; defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the shots were fired, Charles got out of the car and went to the back of it.  Lois could hear &quot;moaning&quot; and saw that Collins was on the ground.  She got out of the car and saw Charles and defendant standing beside Collins who was on the ground a short distance from the trunk of the car.  She could tell that Collins' clothing was wet.  Defendant and Charles then took Collins and put him in the trunk of the car.  They then discussed what to do with Collins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant said that he knew a place where they could bury Collins and it would take a long time for the police to find him.  Collins was alive at that time. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defendant then told Lois to drive the car because he was cut on his left side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At defendant's instruction, Lois drove the car to Lumberton to defendant's home.  Collins was still in the trunk and was &quot;begging for his life&quot;.  All of the occupants of the car except Collins got out and went into defendant's home.  There was a pool of blood on the driver's side of the car.  Lois got a washrag and washed the blood off the car.  While she was doing that, defendant was looking for a shovel with which to carry out defendant's and Charles' plan to bury Collins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Collins begged defendant to let him out of the trunk, defendant and Charles both told him that he might as well shut up because he was going to die anyway.  At defendant's request Lois cleaned up his wound and placed a bandage on it.  His shirt had blood on it and he took it off after which Lois washed blood off the back of his pants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While at defendant's home Charles wiped blood off of a knife that he had.  After staying at the home for about thirty minutes, they all left with Lois driving and Collins remaining in the trunk.  After Lois drove some distance into Robeson County, defendant decided that he would drive.  He stated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that he had changed his mind about burying Collins and knew where he wanted to carry him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With defendant driving they proceeded to the village of Buie in Robeson County.  At that point defendant drove on to a service road adjacent to the Seaboard Coastline Railroad and proceeded north.  After travelling on that road for a reasonable distance, defendant turned the car around and stopped.  Defendant got out and opened the trunk of the car after which Charles and Lois got out.  Defendant cursed Collins and told him to get out.  Defendant and Charles then took Collins out of the trunk and laid him on some rocks.  Defendant had a gun which he then pointed down at Collins' head and fired two shots.  Lois had reentered the car at the time the shots were fired but immediately got out and Charles had the gun at that time.  Charles also had Collins' billfold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant and Charles then took Collins by his arms and dragged him onto the railroad track.  Defendant stated that a train would come along and &quot;do away with him where the police would have a hard time recognizing who he was&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, defendant, Lois and Charles got back into the car with defendant driving.  Charles had the gun&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and said that &quot;it was a good shooting little gun&quot;.  Defendant stated that he shot Collins between his eyes and that Charles shot him in the back of his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, Lois and Charles then proceeded to ride around in Robeson County, and as soon as it was light they went to the home of some of defendant's relatives where they cleaned blood from the trunk of the car.  Thereafter they went to bed at a relative's home and later in the day returned to Fayetteville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On cross-examination Lois testified that defendant worked until noon on 2 July 1977.  When he came home after work she noticed that he had been drinking.  Defendant and another man brought a six-pack of beer to the home.  Defendant, Charles, and the other man drank the beer.  Defendant drank more beer at the bar in East Fayetteville and consumed some more a little later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other evidence presented by the state tended to show:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 2 July 1977 Collins lived and worked on the farm of Henry Clark approximately 1.5 miles from Fayetteville on Cedar Creek Road.  At around 1:00 p.m. on that day, Mr. Clark paid Collins $ 95 or $ 97 for work which he had done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At around 11:30 that night two women saw a pool of blood on a dirt road&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  some 300 feet from Cedar Creek Road.  The next morning police were notified about the blood.  Upon arrival at the scene, in addition to the blood, they found three spent casings, two spent bullets, a knife and a box of matches in or near the blood.  The knife was identified as one belonging to, or similar to one belonging to, Collins.  The home of Leon Goins, father of Lois and Charles, was located in the general area where the blood was found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At around 3:00 a.m. on 3 July 1977 Miller Maynor was driving his car on the service road adjacent to the railroad north of Buie.  He passed a light colored economy car occupied by three persons and shortly thereafter he observed a human body on the railroad track.  Knowing that an Amtrak train was due to pass at about that hour, he went to the body.  Upon determining that the person was dead, he dragged the body off the track.  He then went to the police station in Pembroke, reported what he had found and then returned to the scene where he was met by Deputy Sheriff Garth Locklear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A rescue unit removed the body to Southeastern General Hospital in Lumberton where Dr. Bob Andrews, a pathologist, performed an autopsy later that morning.  Dr. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Andrews discovered extensive cuts to Collins' forehead, face, neck, back, chest, thigh, arms and hands.  He also found gunshot wounds in Collins' neck, groin, leg and thigh.  He removed a bullet from the victim's neck and another one from his brain.  In Dr. Andrews' opinion, death was caused by the shot to the victim's head but either shot could have caused death.  It was his further opinion that if the victim had not been shot, he could have died from the cuts.  A test of the victim's blood revealed 140 milligrams of alcohol per hundred milliliters of blood, the equivalent of .14 on a breathalyzer machine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's evidence consisted of the testimony of Charles Goins.  Charles' testimony is substantially consistent with the version of events testified to by Lois with one major exception.  He stated that he was the person who shot and cut Collins; that he did so because Collins mistreated his sister; and that defendant had nothing to do with the murder, &quot;wasn't with&quot; him and Lois when the killing occurred and &quot;hadn't done nothing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On cross-examination Charles testified that he had been convicted for breaking and entering, larceny, assault with a deadly weapon, driving under the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  influence, escaping from prison, driving while license permanently revoked and assault inflicting serious injury.  He further testified that &quot;I carry a knife and keep it pretty sharp.  If somebody messes with me, I will cut them.  It don't take much for me to cut somebody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of first-degree murder by premeditation and deliberation and by the felony murder rule.  They also found him guilty of armed robbery and kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court then recessed the trial until the following Monday when proceedings were resumed before the same jury pursuant to G.S. 15A-2000 et seq. to determine if defendant's sentence on the murder conviction would be death or life imprisonment.  The state presented evidence summarized as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gertrude Tyler testified that she was at the Tyler home on the evening of 2 July 1977; that while there she saw Collins, Charles, Lois and defendant; that Collins had been drinking wine and he asked defendant to &quot;run him home&quot;; that defendant appeared not to hear Collins and later he asked him again; that defendant then told Collins &quot;Yeah, I'll run you home.  I'll run you to hell, too, while I'm at it&quot;; and that Collins&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  then got into the car with defendant and they rode away.  Counsel for defendant stipulated that on 31 January 1967 defendant was convicted in the Superior Court for Robeson County of three counts of armed robbery resulting from a single occurrence on 4 January 1966.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant testified as a witness for himself at the sentencing phase of the trial.  His version of the events occurring on 2 July 1977 combines elements of the testimony of Lois and Charles.  The gist of defendant's testimony is that he was in the car with them when the shooting and cutting of Collins took place, but that he did not participate in the killing and attempted unsuccessfully to prevent Charles from hurting Collins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant also introduced into evidence a court docket showing that prior to defendant's trial Charles Goins was allowed to plead guilty, and did plead guilty, to the offense of accessory after the fact of murder &quot;in these cases&quot; and received a prison sentence of six years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By way of rebuttal, the state presented a police officer who testified that on 5 July 1977 he searched the automobile in question and in the glove compartment found a box of Remington-Peters .380 ammunition -- 29 unfired bullets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Issues as to punishment were submitted to and answered by the jury as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1. Do you find beyond a reasonable doubt the presence of one or more of the following aggravated circumstances?<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c14">a.  The defendant had been previously convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person, to-wit: three counts of the felony of armed robbery in Robeson County Superior Court on January 31, 1967, for offenses committed on January 4, 1966.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Answer: Yes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c14">b.  The capital felony of murder in the first degree was committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Answer: Yes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c14">c.  The capital felony was committed while the Defendant was engaged in the commission of or attempt to commit a robbery or kidnapping, either or both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Answer: Yes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c14">d.  The capital felony was committed to disrupt or hinder the lawful exercise of the enforcement of the criminal law, to-wit: the arrest of the Defendant for the offense of robbery or kidnapping, either or both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Answer: Yes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c14">e.  The capital felony was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Answer: Yes</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2. Do you find that one or more of the following mitigating&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  circumstances existed at the time the murder was committed?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c14">a.  The defendant was an accomplice in or accessory to the capital felony committed by another person and his participation was relatively minor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Answer: No</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c14">b. The capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was impaired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Answer: No</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c14">c.  Do you find any other circumstance arising from the evidence which the jury deems to have mitigating value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Answer: Yes</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">3. Do you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating circumstances are insufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstance?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Answer: Yes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">4. Do you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstance is sufficiently substantial to call for the imposition of the death penalty?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Answer: Yes</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury recommended that a sentence of death be imposed on the defendant.  Pursuant thereto the court imposed the death sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to the armed robbery and kidnapping charges, the court imposed a life sentence in each case, the sentence in the kidnapping case to begin at expiration of sentence in the armed robbery case.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction for first degree murder entered in the Cumberland Superior Court (North Carolina). Defendant's conviction was predicated on findings of murder based on premeditation, deliberation, and felony-murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction for first degree murder. The court vacated the verdict rendered at the sentencing phase and the judgment of death predicated thereon and remanded the case to the trial court for a new trial on the sentencing phase. The court found that the trial court was not required to charge the jury upon the defense of intoxication even though there was evidence that defendant had been drinking prior to commission of the crime. There was no evidence that showed that defendant's capacity to think and plan was affected by drunkenness. The jury was required to specify in its verdict the theory upon which they found defendant guilty of first degree murder so that defendant could be properly sentenced. N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1237 authorized the use of a written verdict setting out the permissible verdicts. The trial court did not err in questioning the jury about their verdict for purposes of clarity. The court held that the trial court erred in submitting issues under both N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(e)(4) and (7) and that because thereof defendant should receive a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the verdict rendered at the sentencing phase of defendant's trial, and the judgment of death predicated thereon, and remanded to the trial court for a new trial on the sentencing phase.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Thornburg, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 6 March 1978 Schedule &quot;B&quot; Session of Mecklenburg Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged in a bill of indictment, proper in form, with the first degree murder of Eugene Howard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon defendant's affidavit of indigency, the public defender was appointed to represent defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to motion of counsel, defendant was on 7 December 1977 committed to Dorothea Dix Hospital for observation and treatment to determine, inter alia, if he was competent to proceed to trial.  By letter dated 15 December 1977, the court was advised that the medical staff of Dorothea Dix Hospital had completed their examination of defendant and &quot;found him competent to proceed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the guilt determination phase of the trial, the State offered evidence tending to show that on 15 September 1977 between the hours of 6:00 and 7:00 p.m. defendant, armed with a pistol, entered Tony's Jiffy Market located on North Church Street in Charlotte, North Carolina.  By the threatened use of the pistol, he first took a .38 Colt Special pistol from the person of Delton Wilkinson, who was standing in the store, and then by the threatened use of the weapon forced Wilkinson, Eugene&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Howard, an employee of the market, Ervin Gene Holloway, a part-time employee of the market, and Dickson Bailiff into the store's refrigerated room or &quot;cooler.&quot; Defendant then took Mr. Howard to the cash register and ordered him to open it.  When Mr. Howard refused, a struggle ensued during which Howard temporarily seized possession of the pistol.  However, defendant retrieved the pistol and struck Howard three or four times before returning him to the cooler.  After defendant opened the cash register, Howard Oberg entered the store and he was also forced into the cooler.  While defendant was closing the cooler door, Fred Patton entered the building and he also was ordered into the cooler.  At that point, Mr. Howard and others attempted to hold the door closed, but defendant pulled the door open and shot into the cooler striking the refrigeration compressor.  After ordering everyone to take their hands off the door, defendant opened the door and inquired about a money pouch and was told that there was no more money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the State's witness Holloway:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">. . . The next thing that happened was when Mr. Howard grabbed the door and shut it.  Cherry opened the door again and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  after the door was opened, I saw the gun come in.  The gun went off and shot Mr. Howard in the face, and he fell to the floor.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We note that this same witness testified on voir dire as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">. . . Mr. Howard told him that the only money was in the cash register.  Mr. Howard </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">then grabbed the gun, and the gun went off</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">.  The shot hit Mr. Howard in the face. . . .  [Emphasis added.]</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witnesses Wilkinson and Holloway made pretrial identifications and positive in-court identifications of defendant as the perpetrator of the armed robbery and killing.  The witness Wilkinson also identified State's Exhibit 15 as a pistol taken from him by defendant during the robbery.  This exhibit was seized in a motel room occupied by defendant at the time of his arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Valaria Spencer in essence testified that she had known defendant for a short time and had only known him by the name of &quot;Blue.&quot; She stated that when she awakened on 15 September 1977, defendant was asleep in another bed in her bedroom.  When he left at about 1:00 p.m., he told her that he was going to rob a woman at the &quot;Jiffy Mart.&quot; He returned in about ten minutes and said that there were some people on the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  porch next to the store, and he did not get a chance to commit the robbery.  Later in the afternoon, she observed him going toward a Frito-Lay truck and at that time she went home.  About ten minutes later, defendant came to her home with about $ 100 which he said he had gotten from the &quot;Frito&quot; man.  Later in the afternoon, defendant purchased and used both heroin and cocaine.  He also obtained a pistol from a man called &quot;Red.&quot; Defendant then left her home and returned in about an hour with $ 300 or $ 400 and at that time took a pistol from his shirt.  This was not the same pistol he had obtained from &quot;Red.&quot; The witness identified State's Exhibit 15 as the pistol that defendant produced from his shirt.  Shortly thereafter, defendant purchased more cocaine and heroin which he, the witness and her sister &quot;shot into their arms.&quot; Later in the evening, defendant told her sister that he had shot a man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State's witness Billy Ray Frye, Jr., a route salesman for Frito-Lay, testified that on the afternoon of 15 September 1977 at around 3:00 o'clock, he was robbed of about $ 35 or $ 40 by a black male who was about six feet tall.  The robbery occurred in front of the Little General Grocery at&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the corner of Davidson and Charlotte Streets in Charlotte, North Carolina.  He was unable to see this person well enough to identify him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered no evidence on the innocence-guilt phase of the trial.  The jury returned a verdict of guilty of first degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the penalty phase of the trial, the State offered a stipulation that defendant was convicted on the 26th of January, 1973, of the offense of armed robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On this phase of the trial, defendant offered testimony by his father and mother which tended to show that during the time defendant lived with his parents he was obedient, attended church and never gave his parents any kind of trouble.  He left his parents' home and dropped out of school when he was sixteen years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Alsop, an employee of Duke Power Company, testified that he was associated with defendant while defendant was a prisoner on a project which permitted defendant to work outside the confines of the prison.  He stated that he found defendant to be alert, cooperative and dependable.  The witness surmised that defendant obeyed prison rules since he was permitted to work outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Betty Cherry, defendant's wife, testified that she married&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant in February, 1976, and that he worked regularly and was good to her children until he returned to North Carolina in August, 1977.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randy Wright, a boyhood friend, said that he introduced defendant to drugs in the summer of 1977 and that prior to that time defendant was not a user of drugs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by the State of North Carolina under G.S. 30(2) from the decision of the Court of Appeals, reported in 36 N.C. App. 307, 244 S.E. 2d 161 (1978), which reversed the judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Snepp, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, granting the State's motion for a directed verdict at the 14 February 1977 session of the Superior Court of Burke, docketed and argued as Case No. 41 at the Fall Term 1978.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action for damages for wrongful discharge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 1 October 1970 plaintiff, Dr. C. Capers Smith, a medical doctor trained in psychiatry, was duly appointed Superintendent of Broughton Hospital (Broughton), one of the State's hospitals for the mentally disordered.  The appointment, made pursuant to G.S. 122-25 (repealed by 1973 N.C. Sess. Laws, ch. 476, &sect; 133), was for six years.  On 30 April 1973, under circumstances to be discussed later, plaintiff was dismissed as Superintendent.  On 4 May 1973, pursuant to G.S. 122-1.1 (repealed by 1973 Sess. Laws, ch. 476, &sect; 133), plaintiff served upon the Governor and the Chairman of the Advisory Budget Commission a claim for severance pay.  In the claim plaintiff stated he would consider their failure to honor his demand by a given date &quot;as a rejection and denial of this claim&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by all parties.&quot; When no action was taken on the claim, plaintiff filed this action for damages.  Had he been permitted to serve the remainder of his term as Superintendent, plaintiff would have received compensation totaling $ 169,455.59.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the case was called for trial, plaintiff took a voluntary dismissal without prejudice as to defendant Joe K. Byrd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff's evidence consisted of his own testimony, that of Doctors Robert S. Dawson and Trevor G. Williams, and a number of exhibits, including the transcript of a tape recording of the meeting of the Broughton Credentials Committee held on 16 April 1973 (Plaintiff's Exhibit 4).  This evidence -- summarized except when quoted -- is stated below as chronologically as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversy which led to Dr. Smith's dismissal began with the failure of Dr. M. J. Short, the staff doctor on call, to come to the hospital to certify the deaths of two patients, Virginia Evans and William Henry Ward, after being notified of their deaths by the nurse on duty.  Evans died during the early morning hours of 10 February 1973; Ward, about 3:00 a.m. on 11 February 1973.  Dr. Smith learned of these two incidents on Monday, 12 February 1973, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  when he received reports detailing the happenings of the previous weekend from Mrs. Virl Lester and Mrs. Ruby Setzer, the head nurses on the respective wards.  These reports are not in the record, but Mrs. Lester later gave the following version of the events which occurred after Ward's death:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 3:15 a.m. on February 11th while Mrs. Lester was on &quot;C&quot; ward, she was informed that a patient, William Ward, had been found in another unit &quot;slumped in the bathroom not breathing.&quot; When she arrived at the other unit around 3:30 a.m., she determined that Ward was dead and began searching for his family's telephone number.  It was customary for the nurses to locate the number before calling the doctor on duty so that he could notify the family without having to wait at the hospital or make an additional trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After searching unsuccessfully for the telephone number of Ward's family, Mrs. Lester called Dr. Short at 4:10 a.m. She informed him of the situation and he instructed her to place the body on a bed in a single room and told her he would &quot;see him in the morning.&quot; She was &quot;so startled by that statement that [she] figured [she] had not really awakened him . . . so [she] said, 'Dr. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Short, did you hear me say that this patient expired at 3:05 a.m. and now it is only 4:10 a.m. and you ordered the man be placed on a bed and not in the morgue?' . . . [Dr. Short] replied, 'That is right, I'll see him in the morning.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following Dr. Short's instructions, Mrs. Lester helped attendants carry the body to a single room.  She then wrote up the incident in the report book on &quot;U&quot; ward and later reported it to her supervisor.  When she completed her shift at 7:15 a.m., Dr. Short had still not seen the patient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night before Dr. Short have given substantially identical instructions to the nurse who called to inform him of the death of Virginia Evans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Smith received the nurses' reports on the two deaths in a staff meeting on February 12th at which Dr. Short was present.  Dr. Smith informed the staff of the manner in which the doctor on duty had responded to the nurse's call and emphasized that this was not the way he would have expected any doctor at Broughton to have responded.  He told the staff that in the future whenever a doctor on duty was notified of a death, he was &quot;to come.&quot; Dr. Smith said he spoke generally without mentioning Dr. Short's name &quot;so there&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  would not be any direct confrontation.&quot; Having done so, he felt he had &quot;adequately addressed the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometime before February 10th, &quot;hot lines&quot; were installed connecting Broughton and the State's other mental institutions with the office of the Secretary of Human Resources so that employees &quot;who had problems&quot; could contact the Secretary's office directly.  The Secretary had given notice that no employee who used the line was to be &quot;harassed, fired, or demoted, or in any way intimidated because of the use of that telephone service.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After receiving several hot-line calls from hospital employees about the manner in which the deaths of Evans and Ward had been handled, Secretary Flaherty sent his representative, Mr. Bill White, to Broughton to investigate.  White arrived at the hospital about 8:00 p.m. on 13 April 1973.  Bob Cox, a hospital policeman, recognized him as an assistant to Secretary Flaherty and, at his request, escorted him through the alcoholic and neuroscience wards, including &quot;U&quot; ward.  White spoke casually and generally with the patients until Johnny Wilson, an attendant, called him aside for a private talk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cox later informed his superior, Chief of Police Berryhill, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of White's visit.  Berryhill then told Dr. Smith someone from Secretary Flaherty's office had &quot;come in the night&quot; to check on the deaths which had occurred on February 10th and 11th.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Smith decided that if Dr. Short's professional conduct was to be questioned &quot;outside,&quot; it should first be appraised by the hospital's Credentials Committee, a standing committee appointed by the Superintendent from Broughton's active medical staff.  One of the duties of this Committee was to investigate any reported breach of ethics.  After discussing the matter with Dr. Short, plaintiff asked Dr. McCall, the chairman of the Committee, to call a meeting.  When he refused, Dr. Smith called the meeting himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee met in plaintiff's office on the morning of 16 April 1973.  Present were Dr. Mike McCall, Dr. Norman Boyer, Dr. Robert Darrow, Mrs. John Reece, Dr. S. M. Shah-Khan, Dr. Smith and his secretary, Mrs. Hubbard.  Ordinarily, Mrs. Hubbard took the minutes in shorthand, but on this occasion Dr. McCall &quot;brought [a] tape recorder and put it in the middle of the table.&quot; As the morning progressed, discussions &quot;became very heated.&quot; One person &quot;reached over several times and turned off the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  tape and asked that he not be recorded.&quot; When the secretary later attemped to transcribe the tape, she found portions of it unintelligible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In brief summary, the tape as transcribed tended to show:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Smith first reviewed the events leading up to the meeting.  He then told the six Committee members present that he believed Dr. Short's failure to repond to the nurse's call to come to the hospital on the nights of February 10th and 11th would soon be questioned officially.  If so, he thought that &quot;the medical staff should be of one thought&quot; about the matter.  He stated that the purpose of the meeting was to determine whether Dr. Short's conduct had met professional standards.  Dr. Smith said he had no idea who was responsible for the investigation, but he did know that Broughton had again been &quot;put on the spot by the Secretary of Human Resource's night riders, as he had come to call them.&quot; Then, after praising Dr. Short's work on behalf of Broughton during the preceding two years, he asked Dr. Short &quot;to explain the situation as it existed at that time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Short said that when the nurse called him at 4:00 a.m., she told him Ward had been found dead at 3:05 a.m. and that they had&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  been searching unsuccessfully since then for information as to the whereabouts of his family.  Relying upon &quot;the nurse's competence in recognizing a dead person,&quot; he decided to wait until relatives had been found before pronouncing the patient dead.  None were found until sometime the next day.  As to the patient Evans, all Dr. Short could recall was that he had to go to the morgue to pronounce her dead.  Dr. Short expressed considerable resentment that he should be called upon to justify his professional conduct because of Mr. White's visit and suggested that if this is &quot;an example of the supervision administration that will be coming to Broughton [it would be] an untenable place to practice.&quot; He also warned that there &quot;were other harassments coming through the same channels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Short's comments caused Dr. McCall to say that he was &quot;very much concerned&quot; lest they lose Dr. Short.  Dr. Shah-Khan suspected that there were &quot;informers on the staff of Broughton Hospital&quot; who were harming professional reputations by innuendo.  The Committee members also expressed resentment that an investigation of a staff doctor should be instigated without the knowledge of the superintendent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  much discussion as to just how soon a physician should respond to a call to pronounce a patient dead, the consensus seemed to be that he should respond as quickly as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">in his judgment</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was feasible.  It was also noted that since Dr. Smith had talked to the staff on February 12th, no doctor on call had failed to respond promptly.  Eventually, a &quot;resolution&quot; was assembled piecemeal from the floor.  It provided approximately as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deaths of Virginia Evans and William Henry Ward were due to natural causes to which no negligence on the part of any Broughton doctor contributed.  No one suffered any injury, loss, damage, or hurt feelings because of the delay in certifying their deaths.  The attending physician, Dr. M. J. Short, handled all problems properly; and there is no evidence of neglect on his part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This resolution was passed unanimously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately thereafter Dr. McCall asked if the Committee wanted to hear what he knew about the Evans case.  Dr. Smith replied that they did.  Dr. McCall then reported that on the night of Virginia Evans' death the ward nurse had telephoned him at home to say that when she called Dr. Short he had told her to leave the body on the ward; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that she was reluctant to do so because the shift would soon change and they were not accustomed to leaving bodies on the wards; that this patient had an interested family, who had left the ward only 45 minutes before; and that she was uncertain what to do.  Dr. McCall told her to call Dr. Shannon and see if he would respond; that if she could not reach him, she should either move the body to the morgue or call him back.  Dr. McCall said she did not call him back and that he next heard about the incident when Dr. Smith reported the matter at the staff meeting the next morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Dr. McCall's statement the Committee renewed its discussion of whether Broughton had &quot;a stated rule that physicians go and examine the body of a person thought to be dead or dying,&quot; and -- if not -- whether there should be one.  Dr. Smith said he thought there should be such a rule.  In the midst of a heated discussion Dr. Robert Darrow produced the Hospital Procedure Book which contained this directive: &quot;When a patient stops breathing, notify the supervisor and doctor. . . .  The doctor should pronounce the patient dead within a short time after breathing has ceased, fill out the ward card and death package, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  giving information as requested on the outside of the package.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The discussion which this find engendered was terminated by the need to call the witnesses whom Dr. Smith had instructed to be present and who were waiting outside -- Mrs. Setzer and Mrs. Lester, ward nurses, John Wilson and Faye Poteat, attendants, Mrs. Boyles, a telephone operator, and Bobby Cox, security officer.  Although the record discloses that all these persons attended the inquiry on April 16th and were questioned, the transcript introduced in evidence (Exhibit 4) contains only the statements of Cox and Lester.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cox gave the Committee the same information he had reported to Chief Berryhill.  He was then confronted with such questions as &quot;Do you not think it was improper conduct on your part to have taken somebody to the patients' bedroom in the middle of the night?  Did you think you were in charge of the hospital at that particular time?  Why did you take it upon yourself to admit somebody without asking permission from the Superintendent or your supervisor?  Don't you think this was improper conduct on your part?  Was any question asked or any statement made by any attendant, patient or by Mr. White which referred&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to any physician on our staff?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The substance of Cox's answers was that he escorted Mr. White to the wards at 8:00 p.m. -- not in the middle of the night; that he recognized Mr. White as Secretary Flaherty's assistant and therefore he didn't think his conduct was improper; and that he had heard no reference that night to any hospital physician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mrs. Lester gave the Committee her version of the call to Dr. Short, she was asked if she had talked to anybody outside the hospital about the incident.  When she answered NO, the Committee wanted to know how such &quot;confidential information&quot; became known.  Mrs. Lester replied that she understood the &quot;word went over the town through the funeral home.&quot; Several of the doctors then suggested that she had been guilty of &quot;very poor nursing practice&quot; in permitting Ward's body to remain in the bathroom while she hunted for telephone numbers, and that she had applied a &quot;double standard&quot; in criticizing Dr. Short for leaving the body on the bed for four hours.  Mrs. Lester left the meeting in tears, and Dr. Smith went out to console her. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>*</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">*&nbsp;In a deposition filed in the summary-judgment hearings, Mrs. Lester said that at no time did Dr. Smith ever harass or intimidate her; and that &quot;he was his usual kind, gracious self.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After receiving information that certain employees &quot;had been harassed and intimidated&quot; at the meeting of the Credentials Committee, Dr. Trevor Williams, the Western Regional Commissioner of Mental Health and plaintiff's immediate superior, visited him on April 19th and asked for the tapes of the meeting.  He explained that they needed the tapes (1) to ascertain the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Evans and Ward, and (2) to determine whether hospital employees appearing before the Committee had been harassed.  Plaintiff refused to turn over the tapes on the ground that information therein was protected by the doctor-patient privilege.  Dr. Williams told Dr. Smith his refusal would be &quot;considered as insubordinate action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 25th Dr. Williams went to plaintiff's office again.  He informed Dr. Smith that Dr. Zarzar, acting Commissioner of Mental Health, had sent him for the tapes, and that plaintiff could either deliver them or submit his resignation.  Plaintiff again refused to deliver the tapes and claimed that Dr. Zarzar had no authority to dismiss him.  On April 27th Dr. Williams advised plaintiff by letter that because of his refusal to release the tapes he was dismissed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as of 11 May 1973.  On April 30th the Secretary of Human Resources sent plaintiff a telegram dismissing him as of that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of plaintiff's evidence, the trial court granted defendants' motion for a directed verdict.  The Court of Appeals reversed as to the State of North Carolina, and the State appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state hired the physician to superintend a state hospital. After such hire, the Board of Mental Health was transferred to the Department of Human Resources. There was an internal hearing regarding how a death of a hospital patient was handled. The physician's immediate supervisor demanded a copy of the tape, but the physician refused to produce it and was fired as a result. He filed suit against the state for breach of his employment contract. The trial court granted the state's motion for directed verdict. The Court of Appeals reversed. The court reversed the Court of Appeals. The court held that the Secretary of the Department of Human Resources was authorized to dismiss the physician. N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 143A-6 gave the Secretary power to exercise &quot;management functions,&quot; including dismissal of employees. Such transfer was not an unconstitutional impairment of the contract between physician and the state. The court also held that there was cause for dismissal. No physician-patient privilege protected the physician from disclosure of the contents of the tape because, per N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 122-8.1, it did not disclose information necessary for prescription or treatment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the Cleveland Superior Court (North Carolina) judgment of conviction for first degree murder and judgment of sentence to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty to first degree murder and was sentenced to death. He sought review, asserting that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the impaired capacity mitigating circumstance under N.C. Gen.

It held that the jury instruction on impaired capacity was prejudicially inadequate because it did not define the mitigating circumstance set out in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(f)(6). The trial court should have explained the difference between defendant's capacity to know right from wrong and the impairment of his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct. The trial court's cryptic reference to this mitigating circumstance in the definitional portion of the jury instructions was insufficient. Defendant's failure to timely request in writing the submission of other mitigating factors to the jury waived any error in their omission.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried upon an indictment, drawn under G.S. 15-144, which charged that on 3 March 1977 he murdered his wife, Rose Evelyn Allison.  He appeals a judgment of life imprisonment imposed upon the jury's verdict of guilty of first degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tended to show:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 1:30 p.m. on 3 March 1977 defendant's wife and her son, Joseph Whittaker, defendant's stepson, were driving to Joseph Whittaker's house trailer in McDowell County.  About a half mile from their destination they saw defendant parked alongside the road facing the highway in his white Buick.  As they passed, defendant &quot;cranked up&quot; and pulled in behind their car.  When Joseph turned in at his trailer, defendant -- who had been right on his bumper -- sped past them toward his own mobile home located approximately 254 feet away on a slight hill.  After Joseph parked, he and his mother took some articles from the car and started toward the Whittaker trailer.  At that time Joseph saw defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  come around the corner of his trailer.  He was &quot;kind of hunkering down and peeking down there at us&quot; from his trailer.  Joseph, who had previously received a leg injury, thought defendant was looking at him because of his crutches.  Joseph went into the trailer, and Mrs. Allison went back outside to retrieve her purse which she had left on the fender of the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Joseph was still inside the trailer, he heard someone holler &quot;Hey.&quot; Immediately thereafter he heard a rifle shot.  As quickly as he could, he went to the door and from there he saw his mother lying out in the yard.  Looking up the hill toward defendant's trailer, he observed defendant &quot;either knelt or hunkered down&quot; with a rifle against a pine tree.  He held the rifle still aimed at Mrs. Allison.  Seeing no one else anywhere around, Joseph went into the rear bedroom, got a pistol, and went outside.  From up on the hill he heard a car door slam, an engine crank, and a car drive away.  When defendant did not come back down the hill after a few seconds, Joseph went to his mother.  Upon opening her blouse and seeing a bullet hole in her chest, he knew she was dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph drove to a neighbor's house, told him defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had shot his mother, and asked him to call the police.  He then went to the front of defendant's trailer, saw no car, and returned home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Sheriff Eddie Smith arrived first at Whittaker's trailer.  He testified that when he asked Joe Whittaker what had happened, all Joe told him was that defendant had shot his mother.  When Deputy Smith asked him &quot;where?&quot;, Joseph pointed toward the trailer near the tree about 150-200 feet away.  At this time Deputy Mack Autrey drove up.  Smith, who had not been told that Joseph had heard a car door slam or that he had been to defendant's trailer, instructed Autrey &quot;to check the trailer to see if Ervin Allison was in there.&quot; Smith then went to the pine tree near defendant's trailer and measured the distance from that tree to Mrs. Allison's body.  It was 254 feet.  He found bark from the tree lying around its base and footprints facing the Whittaker trailer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Autrey testified that when he arrived at the scene about 3:00 p.m. in response to a call, there was a body lying in the yard.  Deputy Smith met him in the Whittaker driveway, told him he had been informed &quot;that there was a subject in the trailer that just shot this woman and he asked&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  [him] to go to the trailer.&quot; In consequence, Autrey went to the trailer on the hill.  After knocking on the door and getting no response, he tested the door.  It was unlocked, and he went in.  On a couch to the right of the door the deputy immediately saw a .22 caliber rifle, State's Exhibit No. 1.  Autrey seized the rifle, announced his presence and authority, and proceeded to search the trailer for the defendant.  No one was there.  Autrey had neither an arrest nor a search warrant when he entered the trailer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The testimony of State Highway Patrolman T. C. Maye tended to show that on 3 March 1977, shortly after 3:00 p.m., he observed a white Buick traveling very slowly north on U.S. 19-23, north of Asheville.  It matched the description of defendant's car he had received over the police radio.  After following it approximately a mile, Maye stopped defendant's vehicle.  In the car Maye observed &quot;some containers of alcohol&quot;; on defendant's person he found &quot;a container of valium.&quot; Defendant had a strong odor of alcohol about him and was obviously &quot;under the influence.&quot; Officer Maye charged defendant &quot;with driving under the influence.&quot; He then took him into custody, advised him of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his rights, and took him to the Buncombe County jail breathalyzer room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the trip defendant made the voluntary and spontaneous statement to the officer &quot;that he had just gotten rid of seventeen years of trouble and that he was going to get his sister to take care of his 10-year-old child and he was going to hide out in Madison County.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Frank Satterfield, an expert in ballistics and firearm identification, examined the lead fragment removed from Mrs. Allison's body.  However, because of the distortion and mutilation of the bullet, he could not say positively it had been fired from State's Exhibit No. 1.  However, he did say, &quot;but I would explain further that the bullet could well have been fired in there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant did not testify.  The record shows, however, that he &quot;offered 4 alibi witnesses whose testimony tended to show that the defendant was in the barber shop of his brother-in-law Emory Moxley on Lexington Avenue in Asheville, North Carolina, in an intoxicated condition from approximately 1:50 p.m. until 2:25 p.m. on March 3, 1977.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record also discloses that the State offered rebuttal evidence from three witnesses which tended to show &quot;that the defendant or&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his car was seen in the area of the shooting at approximately 1:15 p.m. until 2:10 p.m., 3 March 1977.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction by a jury the Superior Court of McDowell County (North Carolina) for murder, arguing that the rifle should have been suppressed as illegally seized under U.S. Const. amend. IV, N.C. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20, and N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; .C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-401(e)(1). He also claimed that the prosecution was guilty of a discovery violation and that the trial court erred in charging the jury about lying in wait under &sect; 14-17.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted defendant of murder. On appeal, he claimed that the trial court should have suppressed his rifle, that the prosecution was guilty of discovery violations, and that the trial court's charge on murder by lying in wait was erroneous. The court affirmed the judgment below, holding that a warrantless search was constitutional when there was probable cause to search and the exigencies of the situation made the search imperative. Under seven relevant factors, the officer had probable cause to enter the home. Another officer told him that the woman was lying on the ground outside and a belief existed that defendant was armed and likely to escape. The entry was thus justified and seizure of the rifle that was in plain view on entry was lawful. The officer's failure to announce after knocking and before entry, if error, was not a substantial violation of &sect; 15A-401(e)(1)c. There also was no discovery violation or prejudice to defendant because the prosecutor advised counsel of the evidence as soon as he learned about it and gave him the opportunity to speak with the officer. The court also ruled that concealment was not a necessary part of lying in wait under &sect; 14-17.</SPAN></P>
