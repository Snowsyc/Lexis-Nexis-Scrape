Code Ann. &sect; 2917.13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant was driving home from work she came upon an accident and a line of cars waiting to pass by the accident. Defendant crossed into the opposing lanes of traffic and drove around the line of cars. A police officer stopped her and instructed her to go back. Defendant refused, claiming that the road was slippery, and was later arrested. Defendant claimed that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.13 was unconstitutionally vague and that her refusal was valid because her interest in safety outweighed the State's interest in controlling the accident scene. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that there was nothing unlawful about the officer's order for defendant to move out of the wrong traffic lane and back into the correct lane of traffic after she proceeded in the wrong lane to avoid an accident scene. Further, defendant's subject fear about backing down to the line of cars did not make the officer's order objectively unlawful. Moreover, &sect; 2917.13 was not vague and did not give law enforcement personnel unbridled discretion in controlling the scene of an accident. Finally, defendant's safety interest did not outweigh the officer's interest in controlling the accident scene.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers were patrolling city streets enforcing an emergency snow ban whereby no vehicles were permitted to be parked on the streets so that snow plows could clear the roads. When a police officer ticketed a car parked in front of defendant's home, defendant shouted obscenities and threats at the officer. Defendant challenged his conviction for disorderly conduct, and the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 509.03(a)(2) was identical to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11(A)(2), and this statutory provision was constitutional as applied to defendant if defendant's statements constituted &quot;fighting words.&quot; It was clear that defendant's threatening and descriptive language constituted &quot;fighting words&quot; and thus defendant was properly convicted under the ordinance. Further, as there was ample evidence from which reasonable minds could have found that defendant engaged in disorderly conduct, the trial court correctly overruled defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal, and the evidence was sufficient to establish all of the elements of the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board of education and taxpayer filed suit against the county commissioners and housing officer, seeking temporary orders and preliminary and permanent injunctions restraining the commissioners and housing officer from abating taxes in a certain reinvestment area. The complaint challenged the commissioners' authority to abate real estate taxes under the Ohio Community Reinvestment Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3735.65 - 3735.70. It was contended that the Act was unconstitutional, that the commissioners failed to follow requirements of the Act, and that the commissioners' actions went beyond the authority granted by the Act. The trial court dismissed the complaint after finding it lacked jurisdiction. The taxpayer and board of education appealed, contending they were not required to exhaust their administrative remedies. The court agreed, holding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3735.70 provided for administrative review and subsequent judicial review. However, under challenges to the commissioners' authority under the Act and housing officer decisions, injunctive relief against local legislation could be pursued without first exhausting administrative review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the County Court, Western Division, Belmont County (Ohio), which convicted him of failing, neglecting, or refusing to make any tax return or declaration, a violation of Barnesville, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; VIII(A)(1), and failing, neglecting, or refusing to withhold the tax from employees or to remit such withholding to the clerk-treasurer, a violation of Barnesville, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; VIII(A)(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant failed to file and pay income tax returns as an employer within the village and was convicted of violating the village income tax ordinance with respect to the restaurant that he operated. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's convictions. The evidence showed that defendant admittedly owned and operated several businesses, that defendant profited from the earnings of those businesses, and that defendant had employees who were paid a wage. The court also ruled that the trial court was entitled to take judicial notice of the ordinances in question even though they were not presented as exhibits. The court reasoned that Ohio R. Civ. P. 44.1(A)(2), which allowed a court to take judicial notice of a municipal ordinance within the territorial jurisdiction of the court, applied in criminal cases. The court further determined that the trial court did not err when it compelled defendant to give testimony against himself because the trial court repeatedly told defendant that if he testified on his own behalf, he waived his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four days after defendant allegedly committed murder, the prosecutor was sworn in as a judge, and the case was assigned to him. The judge denied defendant's request for his recusal, and assigned a prosecutor to the case who had previously worked with him. The prosecutor filed a motion under Ohio R. Crim. P. 16(c) to perpetuate the testimony of certain certified witnesses, and requested an in-camera certification hearing on the first day of trial. After jury selection, the incamera hearing was held in the absence of defendant and his attorney. The prosecutor told the judge that defendant had threatened witnesses and committed other crimes and wrongdoings. At trial, the prosecutor cross-examined defendant by asking questions as to these matters, which were never substantiated. The judge sustained defendant's objections, but did not prevent the prosecutor from continuing to ask questions following the ruling. The court held that the judge's behavior appeared to be partial, violating defendant's due process right to a fair trial. It was reversible error for the judge to have sat during the Rule 16(c) hearing where he heard assertions about defendant that clouded his impartiality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner filed a site plan and application for zoning permit seeking approval for the addition of a walk-in freezer on the back on the structure he owned. The city planning commission approved the addition on condition that the owner narrow the existing depressed curb/access point and that the site plan be signed by the property owner. About a month later, the commission approved the minutes of the prior meeting. About a month after the second meeting, the property owner again appeared before the commission with the idea of further discussing the site plan. The day after that meeting, the city issued a temporary certificate of occupancy to the owner providing he met the conditional site plan approval. Nearly two months later, the owner filed an appeal of the commission's first action, one that had occurred over three months earlier. The trial court dismissed the appeal. The court affirmed. The court held that the owner waited too long to perfect the appeal. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.01, he had 10 days from the date the commission approved the minutes. The trial court, therefore, lacked jurisdiction to consider the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner acquired a gas station and began selling convenience food items. Thereafter, the city enacted an ordinance that prohibited more than one main use on a lot. When the property owner sought a building permit to remodel the station, the application was denied. The property owner sought a variance, arguing that the sale of convenience items should be allowed as an accessory use to the sale of gasoline. The property owner did not, however, present any statistical evidence as to the percentage of gas stations that sold such items. The court held that the trial court did not err in declining to take judicial notice, under Ohio R. Evid. 201(B)(1), of the frequent sale of such items at other gas stations in the county. The omission of floor plans from the transcript filed with the trial court did not appear to have prejudiced the property owner. The trial court erred, however, in limiting the admission of additional evidence on constitutional issues to whether the ordinance substantially affected health, safety, and welfare. A zoning ordinance could be declared unconstitutional if it did not contain sufficient criteria to guide the exercise of administrative discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had murdered a woman in her apartment during the attempted rape. He contended that Ohio's framework for the imposition of capital punishment was unconstitutional. He also contended that insufficient evidence supported the attempted rape conviction. The court noted that the Ohio Supreme Court had previously rejected defendant's challenges to the death penalty. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.05, the court carefully reviewed the record and held that the aggravating circumstances of the case outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. It found that the jury had substantial evidence to find him guilty of attempted rape because his coat was stained with the victim's blood and with semen, which was consistent with semen in the victim's vagina. It concluded that aggravated burglary has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt because defendant's bloody fingerprint had been found in the apartment. The trial court did not err by instructing the jurors that their finding concerning the sentence of death was a recommendation. The court concluded that the imposition of the death sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate, and that it was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with seven counts of failing to file city income tax returns in violation of Wauseon, Ohio, City Ordinance No. 191.99. After an initial appeal and a retrial on remand, defendant was again found guilty and fined $ 500 plus costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's argument that the State was erroneously listed as the plaintiff in the caption to the case was rejected by the court, as was his claim of prejudice or bias on the part of the trial court. The only specific instance of &quot;chumminess&quot; between the trial court and the prosecutor cited by defendant was that the prosecutor's objections were continuously sustained, which defendant waived objection to by not taking exception at trial. The court also rejected defendant's claim that the controlling ordinance did not require income tax returns to be filed and held that the word &quot;shall&quot; in the ordinance was intended to mean mandatory. The court disagreed that defendant's conviction should be reversed because the tax commissioner failed to send him a statement of his tax debt, because defendant did not taken the position that he would have filed the forms and paid his taxes if he had received statements regarding his tax debt. Finally, the court found no error in the trial court's instruction to the jury that it must accept the law as instructed by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court made its own findings of fact and ultimately concluded that there was no legal basis for the stop work order issued by the commissioner. The order of the board was found illegal and unsupported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence on the whole record. As a matter of law, there did not exist a preponderance of reliable, probative and substantial evidence to support the board's decision. The evidence presented to the board was conflicting at best.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured minor appealed from a judgment of the Erie County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), in favor of defendant doctor. The matter had been submitted to an arbitration board that in turn rendered a two-to-one decision in favor of the doctor. The injured minor had rejected the award, amended the complaint and submitted the matter to the trial court, where a jury had then found in favor of the doctor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There were no findings of fact or majority opinion accompanying the arbitration award, but the dissenting arbitrator had submitted a dissent, including findings of fact. Based on its analysis of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2711.21(C), the court concluded that the trial court erred in excluding the dissenting opinion. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2711.21(C) specifically provided that the decision and any dissenting opinion be admitted into evidence if the decision was in accordance with applicable laws. The court did not interpret &sect; 2711.21(C) to mean that trial courts were to construe the dissenting opinion separately from the decision or award. The decision finding no damages necessarily fell below the cap on general damages specified in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2307.43 and complied with that law. Evidence indicating a settlement had taken place had been allowed, and, although suggestive, the particular line of questioning used was within the trial court's ruling. While the court did not approve of sua sponte dismissals for cause absent a &quot;fair and impartial&quot; inquiry, where defense counsel could have had a juror excused even if the trial court had not excused him, the court found no prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the court ordered that the cause be remanded for a new trial.

Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(1) and for operating a motor vehicle with .10 or more by weight of alcohol per 210 liters of breath in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state trooper observed a motorcycle being driven by defendant at a high rate of speed. After stopping defendant, the trooper noticed he had a strong odor of alcohol about him and his eyes were glassy and bloodshot. His speech was slurred and he performed poorly on the field sobriety tests that were administered. The trooper arrested defendant. Defendant was transported to a patrol post where he tested .147 percent on a blood alcohol content verifier. Defendant was tested 48 minutes after his arrest. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the trial court did not err in overruling defendant's Ohio R. Crim. P. 29(A) motion for acquittal because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(B) allowed for the admission of evidence on the concentration of alcohol in defendant's breath if the testing was performed within two hours of the time of the violation. The court also ruled that defendant's argument that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) was unconstitutional was without merit because &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) was clearly and precisely drawn.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found no reversible error.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator self-insured employers sought a writ of mandamus to compel respondent Industrial Commission of Ohio to vacate earlier decisions denying hearings on applications for handicapped reimbursements. The employers also requested an order directing the Commission to hold hearings on the reimbursements. The referee recommended issuance of the writ. The case was brought in reliance upon Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4121-3-28.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The self-insured employers waited more than five years to apply for reimbursement of payments made to workers who were injured between Jan. 10, 1978 and Dec. 11, 1978. Their requests for hearings before the Commission were denied on the ground that the applications were time-barred under &sect; 4121-3-28, which was amended on Jan. 10, 1978 and Dec. 11, 1978. The employers petitioned for writs of mandamus vacating the Commission decisions and directing the Commission to conduct the hearings. The court denied the petition for the writ, holding that &sect; 4121-3-28(I), which was enacted on Jan. 10, 1978, and equalized treatment of self-insured and state-fund, merit-rated employers, did not subject the self-insured employers to the five-year deadline previously applicable to state-fund employers. However, Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4121-3-28(C), enacted Dec. 11, 1978, expressly made the five-year claim period applicable to the self-insured employers. Further, the Commission properly concluded that &sect; 4121-3-28(C) was applicable to employees injured after Jan. 10, 1978. The section, implementing Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.34, did not work as a retroactive law on the employers.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and held that the expert testimony describing the severity of the victim's head wounds and the physical and circumstantial evidence was inconsistent with a theory of self-defense, and defendant admitted he struck the victim on the head twice with a metal pipe. The court reasoned that it was for the jury to judge the credibility of the witnesses and evaluate the claim of self-defense. The court also rejected defendant's contention that the trial court committed plain error when it instructed the jury to require defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the defense of provocation. The court ruled that the issue was not preserved for appeal, and the error, if any, did not constitute plain error because the outcome of the trial would not have been different. Finally, the court determined that requiring defendant to prove self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence did not violate due process because the prosecution was first required to prove the elements of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time the parents began the action against the doctor, 10 years had elapsed since the last alleged act of malpractice, and their son was 12 years old.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee entered into a written contract for a specified duration as a part-time nursing instructor. She was discharged for insubordination for refusing to wear a nursing cap. The Board found that the employee's discharge was with just cause. The trial court affirmed the Board's decision. The employee contended that a finding that she was discharged for &quot;just cause&quot; under the unemployment compensation law, while similar, did not preclude the litigation of the identical issues regarding whether she was terminated for &quot;just cause&quot; under the written employment contract. The court agreed. The court found that the employee was not estopped from litigating her breach of contract claim because the issues to be tried were not identical to the issues that were tried before the Board. Although the Board found that the employee's continued refusal to wear a cap as required by the written uniform policy constituted insubordination for purposes of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Stark County (Ohio), which dismissed his counterclaim and third party suit against appellees, Stark County Department of Human Services and its employees. The Department had filed suit against appellant for overpayment of food stamps to which appellant filed an answer, counterclaim, and third party complaint alleging a civil abuse of process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that he had been negligently told that he was permitted to receive food stamps and that the workers at the Department should have been responsible to him for the repayment of any amount of overpayment recoverable from him by the Department. The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the Department. The court stated that appellant's own pleadings disputed his contention that the Ohio Sovereign Immunity Act (Act), Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.01 et seq., did not apply because it did not go into effect until November 20, 1985. The Department filed its complaint on December 30, 1985, therefore, the Act was clearly in effect. No abuse of process could occur until the process was instituted. Thus the alleged abuse of process here could only have arisen after the Department's lawsuit was filed against appellant on December 30, 1985. The court did not consider appellant's allegation that the Act was unconstitutional because it was raised for the first time on appeal. The court stated that there was no evidence that the Department's employees were other than negligent, if that, in approving appellant's application for food stamps.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder while committing or fleeing immediately after committing aggravated robbery and was sentenced to death. He appealed from the judgment of the Lucas County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), contending that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress, in failing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter, and in imposing the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to being interrogated with regard to the aggravated murder charge, defendant appeared in another court for arraignment on charges distinct from the present case. A public defender was appointed to represent him in that case. He made a statement that did not pertain to that charge and that was not introduced in the trial on that charge. Only after defendant made that statement was he formally charged with aggravated murder in the present case. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress that statement because he was denied his right to counsel and due process of law. The court held that there was no Sixth or Fourteenth Amendment right to counsel violation as no formal charge was pending against defendant involving the homicide of the victim. The Fifth Amendment was not violated as defendant knowingly and intelligently relinquished his right to counsel in the present action. The court independently weighed the mitigating factors as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(B) and found that they did not outweigh the aggravating factors. The homicide was a totally senseless, cold-blooded killing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Village of Gates Mills challenged an order from the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which held that Gates Mill, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 948, which restricted the operation of truck traffic to designated highways, was unconstitutional. The action by appellee landfill operator sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance was enacted in 1955, but was never enforced. The landfill operator was owned by a neighboring county government. The primary source of ingress and egress to the landfill was a north-south road that was the dividing line between the village and a third county to the east. Because of complaints from its residents, the village advised the landfill operator in 1985 that it intended to enforce Gates Mill, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 948 restricting truck traffic to designated streets. The landfill operator sued, alleging the ordinance was arbitrary, unreasonable, and discriminatory. The village argued that the trial court erred in finding that the ordinance was unconstitutional and that the landfill had standing. The court agreed that the landfill operator lacked standing and reversed the judgment. The court held that an ordinance of a municipality that was primarily residential, prohibiting truck traffic on an exclusively residential street that was the most direct route to gain access to an interstate highway, was neither unreasonable nor unconstitutional where other routes, though less convenient, were available for use.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that &sect; 3313.13 prohibited the assistant prosecutor from holding both positions and that the statute was constitutional. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 3313.13 did not violate the assistant prosecutor's equal protection rights because there was no fundamental right to hold public office and the legislature could have reasonably concluded that the prohibition was necessary to prevent the appearance of impropriety.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with erecting a sign without a permit and erecting a sign without a contractor's license. Defendant was found guilty. The court affirmed and held that a 1984 judgment of dismissal upon which defendant would have the court reverse by reason of collateral estoppel was not contained in the record. Thus, there was nothing before the court to enable it to review the prior judgment to determine whether collateral estoppel applied. Defendant alleged that the prior charges were dismissed and that no trial was had. However, the court held that a dismissal did not necessarily constitute a finding of not guilty. The dismissal could have been based upon procedural grounds. Further, the Toledo, Ohio, Municipal Code &sect; 1379.01(94) definition of sign was not so overly broad that absolutely anything, as defendant contended, constituted a sign. The &quot;airship&quot; drew attention to the place it was situated, since it was three stories high, and defendant admitted that he placed the hot air balloon or &quot;airship&quot; on the site in question to advertise a ground breaking and that he did so without a permit and without a signed contractor's license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee property owners brought an action for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that an ordinance expanding the existing industrial district was void and unenforceable. The trial court declared that the ordinance was improperly enacted and enjoined the residents from developing their property for industrial use. Appellants sought review, arguing that the injunction was an unconstitutional usurpation of the town's legislative prerogative, that the judgment was against the weight of the evidence, and that the residents were guilty of laches. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court found that the trial court had properly issued the injunction to allow the owners to protect their neighborhood while challenging the ordinance. The court found that credible evidence supported the determination that the notice published prior to the amendment's enactment did not comply with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.12, noting that the notice failed to provide a legally sufficient summary of the amendment.

The trial court convicted him of driving an overweight vehicle. On appeal, the court affirmed. Under &sect; 5577.05, the Board could reduce the maximum weight of vehicles using the road for reasons of thaws or excessive moisture. The court found that the Board could have been concerned about the heavy traffic on the road during April, a period of thawing or excessive moisture, and could have passed a resolution accordingly. Moreover, the Board had a duty to maintain the county roads pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 305.12. It was not relevant that the Board had not classified the road as required by Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, that (1) the prosecutors engaged in a pattern of misconduct which denied him a fair trial; and (2) his due process rights were violated when the commencement of his prosecution was delayed for the purpose of prejudicing him. Upon review, the court found defendant's arguments without merit. The jury was able to determine whether the prosecutor's argument was fair. The single comment on defendant's post-arrest silence did not reach the serious constitutional impairment of repeated references to such silence as were made by prosecutors in other cases. The victim testified that she was born June 12, 1973, and thus the crimes as alleged in the indictment would have occurred when she was nine or 10 years of age. Defendant was charged and convicted of seven counts of gross sexual imposition in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.059(A)(3). Since the offenses clearly were alleged to have occurred at least three years before the victim reached her 13th birthday, the issue of the age of the victim at the time of the offense was not seriously at issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for seven counts of gross sexual imposition was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The jury returned a verdict, which was favorable to the insurer. The trial court denied the beneficiaries motion for new trial. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded because the trial court had improperly instructed the jury in accordance with Ohio Rev.

The court entered a judgment in favor of the city and the property owners. The oil company argued that the action brought by the city was within the terms of Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed many assignments of error.

I, &sect;&sect; 9 and 10. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for aggravated robbery but agreed that defendant was deprived of his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase because of his counsel's failure to present any evidence at all in mitigation, although such evidence was available. There was no indication whatsoever that that inaction was part of a tactical or strategic plan. Instead, it was readily apparent from the comments of defense counsel that he simply did not prepare for the penalty phase at all. Further, the court found that defendant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel by the trial court's unreasonable refusal to grant a continuance, when defense counsel had made it plain that he was not prepared to proceed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County (Ohio), which entered a jury verdict convicting him of aggravated murder and sentencing him to death, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.03. Among the issues raised on appeal, defendant argued that the evidence did not support the verdict or sentence, that the jury instructions were erroneous, and that the death penalty statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During his trial for aggravated murder, the evidence showed that defendant used many blunt objects to beat his victims, one of whom died, on the head. The jury convicted defendant of the crime and sentenced him to death, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.03(D) and &sect; 2929.04(B). On appeal, defendant urged that Ohio's death penalty statute was unconstitutional. The court cited current state caselaw and summarily overruled this assignment of error. Defendant argued that he had been proved guilty only of attempted murder, to which the death penalty did not apply. The court found substantial evidence on which reasonable jurors could find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed aggravated murder. Although the trial court incorrectly charged the jury on complicity, the error was harmless, because conviction on any one of several specified grounds for finding aggravation was sufficient to support the verdict. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in substituting an alternate juror or in allowing only &quot;death-qualified&quot; jurors to serve. After an independent review of the aggravating and mitigating factors, the court found that the sentence of death was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the court of common pleas to enter a jury verdict convicting defendant of aggravated murder and sentencing him to death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction had arisen in connection with statements made by the teenaged babysitter for defendant's children to the effect that she and defendant had engaged in sexual activities. On review, the court noted that the credibility of the babysitter was crucial to the State's case. Thus, the testimony of the State's expert witness on child abuse was relevant and material. Her testimony explained how a child could be induced against her will, without physical coercion, by an adult whom she knew and trusted, to engage in sexual conduct and keep the relationship to herself for more than a year and one half. The interplay of the complex psychological factors involved in such conduct by a child was outside the general understanding of average jurors. The court further found that the language of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2151.41 and 2151.022(C) was not unconstitutionally vague because the statutes conveyed sufficiently definite warnings as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices. In affirming, the court rejected the remaining assignments of error regarding the sufficiency of the evidence, cross-examination, and defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

The landowners asserted that the trial court erred in determining that the nonconforming use as a mechanical repair garage did not extend to or include automobile body repair and painting.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In denying injunctive relief, the trial court had determined that the state had preempted the determination of the location, construction, and operation of saltwater brine wells and that, as such, appellants had no authority to prohibit what the state permitted. On review, appellants contended that the state had not preempted townships from enacting and enforcing health and safety regulations that operated to exclude saltwater injection wells in populated residential districts depended upon ground water resources for their water supply. The court, however, noted that appellants had no regulation addressing health or safety aspects of injecting saltwater brine into existing wells. Rather, they had a zoning regulation which prohibited the use of any property within the township as saltwater brine injection wells, without any proof that the prohibition promoted public health and/or safety. In reversing, the court found that because the local ordinance prohibited the construction and operation of saltwater injection wells, which was something permitted by the state, the resolution was unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

When the board learned that the employee had been charged with driving under the influence, it made the decision to terminate the employee, citing her absenteeism and drunkenness. The employee appealed her discharge to the commission, and the commission, finding that the discharge was improper, ordered the employee's reinstatement. The trial court affirmed the commission's decision, and the board sought review. The court held that the commission was the appropriate reviewer of the employee's termination and, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.03, the commission was entitled to modify the board's decision. The court found that there was sufficient evidence that the trial court found the board's actions too harsh because of evidence that all of the employee's absenteeism was excused and the suspension of her license had been modified to allow her to continue to drive for work. The court ruled that the trial court's possible consideration of other improper issues was irrelevant because it had established alternate grounds to support a finding that the employee was entitled to reinstatement.</SPAN></P>

A consent agreement was drafted by the attorney general's office and presented to the doctor. The agreement was signed by the doctor and returned to the attorney general's office, but it was rejected by the hearing officer who issued a report that recommended suspending the doctor's license for 90 days and followed by a two-year probationary period. The Board modified the order and revoked the doctor's license to practice. He appealed to the trial court, which affirmed the Board's order. On appeal, the doctor claimed that the trial court erred in affirming the order of the Board.

The court found that the municipal ordinance barring civil service to the school district was directly in conflict with the state mandate.

Plaintiffs filed their complaint alleging malpractice within two years from the date of injury. The trial court interpreted Ohio Rev.

On plaintiffs' appeal, the court reversed and held that plaintiffs had until one year after the minor's 18th birthday, or four years from the accrual of the action, whichever occurred first. A prior case had held the that &sect; 2305.11(B) was unconstitutional as applied to minors, and therefore minors had until one year following their 18th birthday to file an action. Another prior case had held that the four year bar of &sect; 2305.11(B) still existed and was not unconstitutional.

He argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress a gun that was illegally seized, in not setting aside the jury array, in dismissing jurors for cause, and in denying his mistrial motion based upon the State's violation of a motion in limine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A postal inspector went to defendant's home with a federal search warrant to search for pornographic materials. At the home local police and a local prosecutor were also present. The inspector found an unusual gun, which he believed to be illegal under federal law, and seized it. The gun was found not to be illegal under federal law but it was given to the local police who then prosecuted. On appeal, the court found that the inspector had probable cause to seize the gun for analysis when the inspector was authorized to be on the premises, the gun was in plain view, and it possibly was an illegal gun. The court rejected the argument that the state police were not lawfully on the premises and found that the weapon was seized without violating defendant's rights. The jury array was properly convened and the trial court properly dismissed some jurors for cause. The trial court granted defendant's motion to prohibit any mention that the search was for pornographic materials. The inspector's inadvertent reference to the purpose of his search was not an intentional violation of the order when the prosecutor had neglected to advise the inspector of the limitation.</SPAN></P>

Under &sect; 4117.14(I), the city was required to accept the conciliator's decision and takes steps to implement it. The city asserted that &sect; 4117.14(I) was an unlawful delegation of legislative authority to determine salaries to the conciliator. The court affirmed the trial court's order. The conciliator had very limited discretion when acting under &sect; 4117.14(D)(1). He was required to make a choice between the final settlement offers submitted by the parties. And, his decision was subject to limited judicial review. Therefore, there was no impermissible delegation of legislative authority.

Defendant claimed that, as he stepped into the kitchen, the victim threatened him with a gun, and that defendant disarmed him and fired in self-defense. The ex-wife claimed that defendant threatened her with the gun after the shooting. The court held that the ex-wife was competent to testify at trial under Ohio R. Evid. 601(B) because the couple was divorced. The court further held that the ex-wife's testimony as to communications that occurred at the time of the shooting were not protected by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.42 because they were not confidential in that a third-party, the victim, was present. Additionally, the court held that evidence of manifest weight was presented and that it strained credulity to accept that defendant was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm after he admittedly disarmed the victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested by an officer who observed her exceeding the speed limit and weaving in her lane. A breathalyzer test was administered, yielding a concentration of .199 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath, which exceeded the statutory limit of .10 grams per 210 liters, and which constituted a &quot;per se&quot; violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19 (A)(3). Defendant stipulated that she was driving without bodily injury and property damage liability insurance. In affirming, the court held that the trial court did not err in admitting defendant's breathalyzer test results into evidence. The court determined that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the breath instruments used to test defendant were working properly. The court also found that the Financial Responsibility Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4509.101, was not unconstitutional. The court presumed that the statute was constitutional.

The trial court ordered all sentences to be served consecutively. In affirming, as modified, the court held that: (1) the trial court did not err in denying defendant's pre-trial motion to appoint an independent forensic pathologist, at the State's expense, to buttress his defense because defendant failed to show that an appointed expert would have significantly helped his case; (2) while the trial court erred in permitting extraneous evidence to be considered in answering a jury's question, the error was harmless and did not prejudice defendant; (3) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give either of the requested instructions on eyewitness identification; and (4) only two three-year terms of actual incarceration could be imposed on the firearm specifications because the murder of the father and subsequent attempted murder of his daughters were two separate transactions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant salad product manufacturer sought review from a judgment of the Cleveland Municipal Court (Ohio), which dismissed its counterclaim against appellee corporation alleging that a price increase in salad dressing which the manufacturer bought from the corporation constituted an unfair trade practice, price discrimination, and created monopolistic conditions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer argued that the corporation's increase in the cost of salad dressing after he arranged to pick up the dressing in order to save on shipping costs constituted an unfair trade practice actionable under Ohio Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1345.03(B)(2). Finding no error in the trial court's holding, the court affirmed the judgment in favor of the corporation. Section 1345.03 prohibited a supplier from committing an unconscionable act or practice in connection with a consumer transaction. A consumer transaction referred to a sale to an individual for purposes that were primarily personal, family, or household. The court held that the term &quot;individual&quot; meant a natural person and did not include a corporation. Further, &sect; 1345.01(A) required that, to qualify as a consumer transaction, a sale must be for personal, family or household purposes. The manufacturer was a corporation and was not included in the definition of &quot;individual&quot; under the statute. Also, the manufacturer clearly purchased the salad dressings for business purposes. Accordingly, the court overruled the manufacturer's assignment of error.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed, holding that failure to make a good-faith effort to settle did not require a showing of &quot;bad faith.&quot; Rather, the term &quot;good-faith effort to settle&quot; meant an honest, purposeful effort, free of malice and the design to defraud or to seek an unconscionable advantage.

On appeal, defendant contended that he was not required to have shown proof of financial responsibility and that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4509.101 violated Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 1. The court found that Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was discharged from her full-time position but she retained a separate part-time position elsewhere. She was receiving Social Security benefits. The claimant filed an application for unemployment compensation, but it was denied.

Her appeal with the board of review was denied and her application to institute further appeal was denied. The trial court affirmed the board of review's decision. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial court was correct in finding that the claimant's Social Security payments offset her unemployment benefits. Under Ohio Rev.

The court held that minor malpractice litigants were subject to the same statute of limitations under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11 as other malpractice litigants. Thus, under &sect; 2305.11(A), a minor malpractice litigant was required to bring a cause of action within one year after the injury resulting from the malpractice was discovered. Additionally, under &sect; 2305.11(B), a minor malpractice litigant was required to bring her claim within four years after the act of omission constituting the alleged malpractice had occurred. In the case at bar, not only did the minor fail to bring her claim within one year after the injury was discovered, she also did not bring her claim within four years after the act or omission constituting the alleged malpractice occurred. Finally, minor plaintiffs affected by the Schwan/Opalko decisions must have instituted their lawsuit within one year from the date of the Schwan decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Sandusky County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted him of knowingly possessing more than three times the bulk amount of marijuana, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(6), and knowingly possessing a controlled substance in an amount equal to or exceeding the bulk amount but in an amount less than thee times that amount to wit: cocaine, a violation of &sect; 2925.03(A)(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his convictions on the ground that the indictments did not set forth an offense. The court held that the indictments satisfied the requirements of Ohio R. Crim. P. 7 and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10 because defendant was informed of the essential facts constituting the offense for which he was tried. Even though one indictment failed to allege that defendant knowingly possessed a &quot;controlled substance,&quot; the indictment was not defective because it did state that defendant knowingly possessed &quot;marijuana.&quot; Defendant also contended that the trial court should have granted his motion for a new trial on the ground of juror misconduct. The court found, however, that pursuant to Ohio R. Evid. 606(B) and the aliunde rule, the juror was not entitled to subsequently impeach his verdict after it was entered. Finally, the court determined that defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied because the evidence was seized pursuant to the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule. The affidavit that was submitted to obtain the search warrant was not so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a husband and wife, challenged a summary judgment from the common pleas court (Ohio) that was entered for appellee, a metropark system of a city. The trial court denied relief to appellants in their tort action alleging the city's negligent maintenance of a walkway upon which the wife tripped and fell on a pipe cap that extended above the surface level of the walkway.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife's accident occurred at the city's zoo. The city's motion for summary judgment alleged the city's immunity under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1533.18(B) because the wife did not pay an admission fee, which made her a recreational user. The trial court incorrectly granted summary judgment because a genuine issue as to a material fact existed as to whether the wife was a recreational user as referred to in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1533.181 and as defined by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1533.18(B). The court was not convinced that the wife was a recreational user. The court applied the doctrine of ejusdem generis to interpret the scope of the meaning of &quot;recreational user.&quot; The court held that walking through a zoo was not a pursuit similar to the other types of activities that were identified in &sect; 1533.18(B). The court found that, although entering a zoo to view exhibits might require personal involvement and walking outdoors, it was not a pursuit of an active sporting nature. Because the court upheld the summary judgment, it did not need to and did not decide the constitutionality of applying Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1513.181 to two different classes of zoo patrons, paying and non-paying.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was cited for violations of &sect; 850.08(a) and (b), after he had been hauling freshly cut oak limbs that overflowed his pick-up truck.

Defendant argued that &sect; 850.08(a) and (b) were unconstitutional and that he was convicted of a crime in which he had no notice. On appeal, the court ruled that constitutional rights could have been lost as finally as any others by a failure to assert them at the proper time and defendant had failed to raise them below. Considering only defendant's argument that the guilty finding was against the manifest weight of the evidence, the court sustained defendant's assignment of error as to his conviction for violating Akron, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 850.08(a), which required that the use of a tarp or other effective covering for transporting litter or refuse. The court found no sufficient proof that the cover with the ladder and rope was not effective. However, the court held that the conviction for violating Akron, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 850.08(b), which required that the refuse or litter was completely covered, was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS) and the Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund (PFDPF), appealed the decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County (Ohio), which granted summary judgment to plaintiff employee, ordered PERS to accept return of his contribution and make an appropriate retirement allowance, and ordered PFDPF to recompute his retirement allowance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was a volunteer firefighter and then a city employee. He made PERS contributions. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 145.02(A) did not authorize that a preexisting member had to forfeit contributions or be excluded from membership. The statute was designed to prevent dual contributions. There was no provision in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 742 for a participating member of PFDPF to receive credit for service as a part-time volunteer. Therefore, the trial court erred in holding such a calculation to be made. However, because the employee was a member of PERS, he had rights to purchase service credit for his service as a volunteer. Any right the employee had to service credit as a volunteer was under PERS rather than PFDPF. Therefore, on remand, the trial court was directed to calculate the amount of the employee's service credit that he could purchase. The employee never accepted or tendered for payment the check sent to him by PERS. A claim did not accrue until the check was tendered. The mere act of informing the employee that he was no longer a member of PERS and sending a refund application did not create a cause of action and the action was timely filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment except it reversed the order that PFDPF had to recompute the employee's retirement allowance. The cause was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5577.05 permitted the commissioners of any county to reduce the maximum weight of vehicles and loads by 50 percent for reasons of thaws or excess moisture. The county commissioners passed a resolution in the spring to restrict the load limit of vehicles on certain county roads that were subjected to increased traffic because of a detour on a state road. The truck driver's vehicle was 18,000 pounds over the posted restricted limit. He was found guilty and fined. On appeal, the court held that the language of &sect; 5577.05 pertaining to the weight restriction used when a highway would be damaged by heavy traffic during thaws or excess moisture applied to a situation where a detour or other circumstance created heavy traffic during a period of thawing or excessive moisture. The county commissioners were liable under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 305.12 for a failure to properly maintain county roads. The court held that if the commissioners were liable for the failure to maintain roads, they had the power and obligation to reduce load limits when heavier than normal traffic was passing on the roads during the spring months.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his co-defendant were observed by police making an &quot;exchange.&quot; The co-defendant dropped a package of drugs. An officer observed a bulge under defendant's shirt and, after hearing the click of a gun hammer, put his hand around defendant's waist and extracted a loaded gun. Defendant subsequently attempted to escape from the officers and was detained. Counsel was appointed for defendant after he was declared indigent. Four days before trial, defendant filed a motion for a continuance seeking to have his court-appointed counsel withdraw and to allow the entry of appearance by new counsel. The motion was denied. The trial court also denied a motion to suppress the gun seized from defendant, which defendant alleged was illegally seized due to the absence of probable cause and a warrant. The court held that the motion for continuance was properly denied in the absence of any evidence of a lack of communication between defendant and his appointed counsel, who was prepared to try the case. The officers had probable cause to arrest defendant after seeing the exchange and a bulge in defendant's waist following the sound of the click of a gun.</SPAN></P>

Defendant consumed alcohol, retrieved two guns, went to the victim's apartment, and killed the victim and the other man. He was convicted and sentenced to death. He appealed, alleging numerous assignments of errors. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not err by disqualifying two prospective jurors because of their objections to the death penalty. One of the prospective jurors had a conscientious or religious objection to the death penalty, and the other stated he could not condemn someone to death. The court found that the trial court did not err in not allowing defendant to question prospective jurors on what specific facts they considered to be aggravating because defendant was not entitled to have any prospective jurors announce, in effect, what his verdict would be before a hearing on all the evidence. The court noted that defendant could not state that he was unfairly limited because voir dire lasted five full days and encompassed over 880 pages.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 1311.011(4)(a) had been complied with. The bank disbursed five checks, totaling a sum of $ 67,000.00, to the contractor. The bank was aware that the contractor's checking account was overdrawn on various occasions. The contractor failed to complete the project, and several mechanics liens were placed on the owner's property. The liens totaled $ 19,400.37. The trial court awarded the owners $ 19,400.37 as compensatory damages and found that the bank was grossly negligent. Both the owners and the contractor appealed the decision. The court rejected the owners' argument that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1311.011 violated the equal protection clause by shielding the bank from liability for its ordinary negligence. The court vacated the award to the owners because there had been no final ascertainment of the validity of the various liens.</SPAN></P>

During the trial, the victim's father yelled that defendant's father was lying while defendant's father testified. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in not granting a mistrial when the murder victim's father yelled because the trial court gave a cautionary instruction to the jury. The court found that the trial court properly denied a motion for acquittal on the kidnapping charge because there was evidence that established the victim's kidnapping, which if believed by the jury, was perpetrated by defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant used a public address system while preaching at a series of outdoor revival meetings. Due to the high level of voice amplification, area residents complained to the police, and defendant was warned that he would have to lower the volume of his amplifying equipment. However, defendant refused to comply with the warning and was cited for disorderly conduct. A pretrial motion to dismiss upon the alleged ground that &sect; 2917.11 was unconstitutional was overruled, and defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 2917.11(A)(2) was sufficiently definite to apprise a person of ordinary intelligence of the conduct proscribed by its terms. The court noted that it was the volume of the noise rather than the content of the speech which formed the basis for the conviction. Defendant's knowledge was sufficient to satisfy the mental culpability requirement of recklessness as expressed in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.22(E). The record disclosed ample evidence to support the judgment and sentence. The error alleged by the State, that is, that the lower court erred in excluding testimony as to a decibel meter reading taken at the time of the offense, was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and an accomplice hitched a ride with a driver who agreed to take them to a bar and to wait for them while they robbed the owner. Defendant demanded money from the owner, but, when the owner refused, defendant shot him three times, killing him. The driver reported the incident to the police, and defendant and his accomplice were arrested. Defendant was convicted, and he appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the pre-trial identification proceedings were not so suggestive as to taint the reliability of the in-court identification of defendant. The trial court did not err in failing to journalize its reasons for overruling defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment. Defendant's motion raised only legal issues, and Ohio R. Crim. P. 12(E) did not require a statement of reasons. The overruling of defendant's motion to prohibit death penalty qualifications was not error nor was a decision to seat one jury for both the trial and penalty stages. The trial court adequately instructed the jury. The prosecutor's statements during closing argument were not prejudicial and did not warrant a reversal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted him of one count of aggravated burglary, one count of aggravated robbery, and two counts of aggravated murder with death penalty specifications.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another person broke into the victim's house and robbed and murdered her. Defendant had previously performed odd jobs for the victim. Defendant was convicted. He appealed, claiming 26 errors had been made. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part. The court found that, although the trial court referenced the imposition of the death penalty, it was not error. The court indicated that the better procedure would have been no comment by the trial court on the question of who bore the ultimate responsibility for determining the death penalty. However, the court found that during the penalty phase of the trial, the prosecutor's remarks that if defendant were given a life sentence that he could go free in less than 20 years was reversible prejudice. The court noted that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2967.13(D), (E) demonstrated that defendant could not be released before 20 years. The prosecutor's misstatement of the law and the jury's obvious confusion, along with the trial court's inadequate answer to the jury's questions, compelled the court to hold that prejudicial error had occurred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for one count of aggravated burglary, one count of aggravated robbery, and one count of aggravated murder. The court reversed defendant's conviction for the other count of aggravated murder. The court reversed and remanded the sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a declaratory judgment action, plaintiff, a home rule charter city, challenged the holding of the Common Pleas Court, County of Summit, Ohio, that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 4117 was enacted pursuant to the state's police power and constituted a matter of statewide concern and that, therefore, insofar as the city's charter conflicted with ch. 4117 relating to collective bargaining for its policemen, the local or home rule had to yield.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city was a home rule charter municipality under Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect;&sect; 3, 7. Defendant, the Ohio State Employment Relations Board (SERB), was a state agency created by the Ohio legislature to administer and apply Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 4117, the Ohio Public Employee Collective Bargaining Act. The city charter designated the mayor as chief executive officer with broad and specific powers over the administration of all city affairs, including wage determinations for all public employees. A patrolman's benevolent association filed a petition with SERB, under ch. 4117, to be recognized as the bargaining agent for the city's police patrolmen. The city then filed the instant action. On appeal, the court cited Ohio Supreme Court precedent and stated that ch. 4117, providing a comprehensive, statewide system of collective bargaining for public employees, was constitutional and thus applicable to municipal employers and employees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees had been classified civil service employees at a county hospital until Ohio Rev.

The employees appealed their subsequent layoffs to the board of review, which ruled that it lacked jurisdiction because the employees were unclassified. The trial court affirmed the board's determination. On appeal, the court affirmed. Section 124.11(A)(20) did not amount to an unconstitutional taking. They had no ownership of property in the statutory benefits and protection provided them while classified civil service employees within the scope of the &quot;taking clause.&quot; Moreover, the amendment to &sect; 124.11(A)(20) did not impair the employees' contractual rights in violation of U.S. Const. art. II, &sect; 28.  Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 124.11 did not create any contractual rights between the state and the employees. Also, the amendment neither removed nor impaired vested rights acquired under existing statutes and thus was not retrospective.

Defendant was eventually arrested. Shortly before trial, defendant's counsel tried to broker a plea bargain. When the prosecutor refused to agree to the terms, a bench trial was held.

The nephew contended that the directed verdict was improper, that the procedures in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2107.27 et seq. were unconstitutional, and that certain procedures provided in &sect; 2107.27 et seq. were against public policy.</SPAN></P>

When proceedings were commenced to probate and establish the lost will of the decedent, the judge ordered it probated. The probate court found that the decedent gave all of his property, real and personal, to his sister, the legatee. The nephew's will contest action ended in a directed verdict for the legatee and the executrix. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the challenges to the statutes made on appeal were not advanced below and were, therefore, overruled. Further, the court found that the probate court made the correct decision in granting the directed verdict. The nephew failed to attack the will based any of the prescribed reasons for setting it aside as enunciated by the Ohio Supreme Court. In addition, the court held that it was without jurisdiction to inquire into irregularities or errors.

Defendant attempted to introduce evidence that one of the victims had prior sexual experiences with two other men to demonstrate that the source of the physical condition her vagina was the result of sexual assault by other men. The trial court excluded that evidence, which defendant argued constituted reversible error. The court disagreed and affirmed defendant's convictions. The court stated that even if the evidence was admissible under the Ohio Rape Shield Law, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.22(D), because of its materiality, defendant did not lay a proper predicate for the admissibility of that type of evidence. Defendant did not attempt to proffer any competent medical evidence to demonstrate that the scars in question pre-dated the rape for which he was charged. The court also held that even if the trial court committed error, the victim's testimony regarding her assault by defendant was corroborated by her brother's testimony that he saw defendant having sexual contract with the victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Ohio Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a provision of the statute of limitations for malpractice actions, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2502.11(B), which allowed children whose cause of action accrued prior to the age of 10, until the age of 14 to file suit. Eight months later, when she was nine years old, the minor brought her malpractice action, claiming substandard care at the time of her birth. The trial court ruled that the claims were time-barred under &sect; 2502.11 and the minor appealed. In reversing, the appellate court ruled that the supreme court decision did not have retroactive effect to require the minor to file within a year of her birth, when her claim accrued, because such retroactive application would destroy an accrued substantive right, in conflict with Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. Rather, the minor was entitled to a reasonable time in which to file her claim and the filing within eight months of the supreme court's decision was reasonable. Thus, the claims were not time-barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was driving on a four-lane portion of a one-way street. The school bus was stopped on the east side of the street picking up small children. Defendant drove past the bus in the farthest west or next to the farthest west lane. On appeal, defendant argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional in that it arbitrarily penalized passing a school bus headed in the same direction as the driver while permitting passage by a driver similarly situated in the same lane of traffic but moving in the opposite direction. Further, defendant argued that because children had to be picked up on their residence side of the street, there was no danger that any child would attempt to cross in front of the school bus. Affirming, the court held that there was a rational basis for treating traffic traveling towards a bus differently from that traveling in the same direction. The most compelling reason was that small children could not see traffic moving in the same direction on the other side of the bus until they were in the middle of the street. Further, children could not always be picked up on their residence side of the street if the street was one-way with residences on both sides.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A construction company was determined to have violated a provision under the auspices of the Board. A civil penalty was assessed and the company sought to appeal. When it failed to deposit the amount of the assessment pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The construction company sought review, arguing that the statute which required the deposit of the assessment before the appellate process deprived the company of both due process and equal protection rights. On appeal, the court held that because the company had been afforded several opportunities to seek a review of the civil penalty assessed against it without the requirement of a prepayment of the assessed penalty, and because the requirement of prepayment furthered the legitimate government interest of insuring prompt collection of assessed penalties, along with the fact that a fundamental right was not being imposed upon, the decision of the Board was not arbitrary, capricious, or inconsistent with prevailing law.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed the convictions. He contended that his reindictment for the offenses after they were dismissed pursuant to an agreement violated his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a drug courier who was arrested and charged with the drug offenses in 1980. He entered into an agreement to furnish drug trafficking evidence, which resulted in the dismissal of all charges without prejudice. He was reindicted for the same four offenses in 1984, found guilty, and sentenced. The agreement was not a plea bargain. It was an informal agreement between the State authorities and the Federal Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) wherein defendant was required to assist the DEA in a drug investigation. Several days after making the agreement, defendant made no further contact with the DEA. He argued that his reindictment violated his constitutional rights and also his right to a speedy trial. In affirming all but one of the possession convictions, the court held that defendant's constitutional rights were not violated. The court found that (1) defendant did not fully perform his part of the agreement, (2) for constitutional purposes, the delay in the reinitiation of the charges was not unduly long, and (3) the conviction for possession of methaqualone was improper because it was an allied offense of trafficking in methaqualone.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 3735.66, and designated the legislation as emergency in nature, which meant that referendum rights were eliminated. In approving the legislation, the court noted that the reasons given by the council for declaring the resolution and ordinances emergency measures were not obviously illusory or tautological. Each piece of legislation stated as the basis of the emergency the immediate preservation of public welfare for the reason that additional jobs and revenues for the city might have been lost unless the legislation took effect immediately. The court held that the loss of the opportunity for additional jobs and revenue due to a failure to take prompt action was a genuine rather than an illusory or tautological reason. There was no deception upon which the taxpayer relied to her detriment. The court also concluded that there was no evidence of abuse of discretion. The council was candid with the citizens about the true impetus for the legislation. Because the taxpayer was not entitled to injunctive relief, the trial court's erroneous conclusion that she had an adequate remedy at law was harmless.</SPAN></P>

The trial court erred in applying the good faith exception to the warrant. There was, however, probable cause for a warrantless arrest based on the totality of the circumstances. The officer had reasonable grounds to believe that a felony had been committed.

The jury found him guilty and defendant was sentenced to death. Defendant appealed, but the court affirmed. The court first addressed defendant's contentions regarding the imposition of capital punishment and found that Ohio's framework governing the imposition of the death penalty was constitutional. Additionally, the court held that the jury selection process had been fair, including the dismissal of jurors opposed to capital punishment. In response to defendant's contentions that the report of his mental examination should not have been submitted to the jury, the court found that defendant willingly submitted to the examination, knowing that the jury would receive the report. Defendant's constitutional rights were not violated when his examination was performed by psychologists rather than psychiatrists. Finally, the court held that the jury was properly instructed during the punishment phase of defendant's trial that the penalty phase of defendant's trial had been fairly conducted and that death was an appropriate sentence.</SPAN></P>

The victim came out of the house and asked defendant to take the car elsewhere. An argument ensued and defendant left. Defendant came back and shot the victim then fled. The next day, defendant returned to the scene to strip another car. Defendant was arrested and convicted. Defendant sought review, contending that his conviction of aggravated robbery and felonious assault were unconstitutional and violations of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.25. On review, the court held that the offenses under the existing fact situation were not allied offenses of similar import. The court found that defendant committed the offense of aggravated robbery when he returned to the immediate vicinity of the stolen car with a gun. The offense of felonious assault, according to the court, was not committed until he attempted to cause or did cause serious physical harm to the victim. Since these offenses were of dissimilar import, the court found it unnecessary to make inquiry as to whether the offenses were committed separately or with a separate animus as set forth in the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that even though defendant went to the victim's apartment with the intent to kill someone else, that intent was properly transferred by the trial court to the victim. The court concluded defendant's conviction was supported by substantial evidence where the evidence showed defendant engaged in a brutal and senseless attack upon the victims. The court determined that the trial court correctly found that the aggravating circumstances were not outweighed by the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt based on the trial record.

The police officer checked defendant's record and learned of the suspended license. The trial court granted defendant's motion and suppressed the evidence obtained by the police officer. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision. The court found that there was not a sufficient detention of defendant to have constituted a search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The court held that whenever a police officer accosted an individual and restrained the individual's freedom to walk away, the seizure had to have been reasonable. The reasonableness of a seizure was determined by a balancing of the public interest and the individual's right to personal security free from arbitrary interference by law officers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review of defendant's conviction and sentence, the court noted that, in defendant's statement to the police, he admitted that he alone hit the victim with a bat but claimed that he never intended to kill him. Defendant's confession was admitted over his protestation that the police commanded him to waive his Miranda rights. Defendant contended that the trial court incorrectly charged the jury that commission of aggravated murder with prior calculation and design was a death penalty specification. The court agreed that prior calculation and design did not give rise to a death penalty finding. However, the court overruled another assignment of error because the jury found that defendant committed the aggravated murder in the course of aggravated robbery, which was a valid specification for the death penalty. The court thought that the savagery of the victim's injuries undermined defendant's contention that he had no intent to kill, and gruesome photos were probative evidence on this issue. The court reversed defendant's death sentence because the jury was permitted to consider an invalid aggravating circumstance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners had a house in the city in which they rented out rooms. The city license was renewed on a yearly basis. In March of 1981, the city limited the issuance of licenses for third floor occupancy. Obviously, the homeowners' right to rent the third floor of their residence remained unaffected because they had a valid temporary rooming house license on March 17, 1981. They were affected however, when they contracted to sell their residence and discovered that the buyers were unable to obtain a rooming license pursuant to &sect; 1313.05(b). The sale was not completed and the homeowners filed suit, seeking a declaration that both &sect; 1313.05 and East Cleveland, Ohio, Charter &sect; 3 were unconstitutional. They also sought an award of damages for the city's tortious, wrongful, and unlawful conduct. The court found that the homeowners offered no evidence establishing that the ordinance was unreasonable or arbitrary. Thus, the ordinance in question was a valid restriction on a preexisting nonconforming use. Accordingly, the trial court properly concluded that East Cleveland, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 1313.05 was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The fact that no women and no men who were using the restrooms for legitimate purposes were observed, video taped, or arrested, but only men who had indicated they were there for other than legitimate purposes, did not render the enforcement of the statute against defendant discriminatory or selective.

On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision and remanded the case with instructions for the trial court to assess four points against the defendant's driving record. The court found that a clerical error had been made in the drafting of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.40(G)(12), which provided for six points against a driving record for violations of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(B). Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.40(G)(4) provided for only four points for a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A). The court determined that this inconsistency was the obvious result of a clerical error and did not warrant invalidating the entire statute. The court concluded that the appropriate remedy was for the court to give effect to the legislature's obvious intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient challenged a judgment of the County of Lorain Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which dismissed the patient's motion seeking prejudgment interest under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1343.03(C) on a judgment the patient obtained in her medical malpractice action against defendant doctor. The trial court declared &sect; 1343.03(C) to be unconstitutional on equal protection grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court also held that neither the trial judge nor defense counsel were subject to subpoenas to testify in a hearing on prejudgment interest. On appeal, the court disagreed and affirmed that part of the judgment. Under Ohio R. Civ. P. 45(B), a court could quash a subpoena if it was unreasonable or oppressive and could issue a protective order to protect a person from unreasonable discovery requests under Ohio R. Civ. P. 26(C). Because both of the patient's subpoenas were very general and raised serious issues concerning the propriety of the subpoenaed persons testifying to the underlining malpractice action, the court held that the trial court did not err in disallowing the subpoenas. However, the court held that the trial court's decision that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1343.03(C) was unconstitutional was plain error. Contrary to the trial court's finding, &sect; 1343.03(C) did not unfairly classify and penalize defendants for a breach of duty to negotiate in good faith. Rather, the legislative objective behind prejudgment interest awards was to encourage settlement and discourage delay, and the operation of &sect; 1343.03(C) bore a fair and substantial relation to that objective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that part of the trial court's judgment declaring the prejudgment interest statute to be unconstitutional and affirmed the remainder of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

Reversing his convictions for two counts of aggravated murder with aggravating circumstances, the court held, inter alia, that: (1) the nine-member grand jury was proper under Ohio Const. art.

However, a new trial was necessary because: (1) the trial court failed to determine whether a witness' testimony that was hypnosis-affected was reliable; and (2) the court could not conduct a proper review of defendant's sentence because the trial court's order failed to weigh factors under Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was on a sailboat with his family. Two officers alleged that the sailboat did not have the &quot;Ohio number&quot; or &quot;hailing port&quot; name that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1547.53 required. They also alleged that though they asked defendant to stop the sailboat five times and were traveling in a marked patrol boat with a revolving light, they required the Coast Guard's help to stop him. The officers alleged that they were only able to handcuff defendant when working as a team. Defendant testified that when the officers tried to handcuff him, he did not cooperate and held onto cables. Defendant contended that the convictions were contrary to the weight of the evidence and that they violated his constitutional rights due to lack of probable cause. The court affirmed the judgment. Because the officers had probable cause to believe that defendant was violating &sect; 1547.53, the stop was not random or based simply on suspicion. Consequently, the stop did not violate defendant's constitutional rights. Given the testimony, credible and competent evidence supported the conviction.</SPAN></P>

A five-year extension of that variance was subsequently granted. Thereafter, the permit was transferred. In 1984, the board denied a request for another five-year extension of the variance. It also denied an application for a conditional use permit. The trial court affirmed the board's decision to deny the application. The operators appealed from that judgment. The court reversed and entered a judgment in favor of the operators, holding that the decision made with regard to the extension was not res judicata with regard to subsequent application because the parties and issues were different. The board's decision to deny the operators' application to operate the quarry for its useful life constituted a taking of their property. In that regard, the court noted that the discontinuance of quarry operations would result in a large amount of the recoverable deposits remaining in the ground. Moreover, the board's decision was contrary to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.14, which set forth the standards governing the issuance of variances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that Mentor, Ohio, City Ordinance &sect; 139.01was unconstitutional because it treated possession of less than 100 grams of marijuana as a misdemeanor of the fourth degree while the parallel state statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.11, treated the same offense as a minor misdemeanor. The court disagreed, and affirmed defendant's conviction. The court referred to a previous decision of the Ohio Supreme Court and its holding that, when a municipal ordinance varied in punishment with a state statute, such ordinance was not in conflict with the statute when it only imposed a greater penalty. The court observed that, under the holding of this case, a municipality could impose a disparate sentence for a crime and not be in conflict with the general law of Ohio, as prohibited by Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3, so long as the disparate sentence did not alter the degree of the crime from a misdemeanor to a felony.

Defendant pled self-defense. He was found guilty of the murder and for felonious assault. On appeal the court affirmed. Defendant failed to meet his burden of proving self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05(A). The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict. Defendant approached the house with guns, his ex-wife and mother-in-law testified that defendant fired many shots at the victim. Defendant had previously threatened to kill everyone in the family. After the incident, defendant told the police that he hoped he had killed the victim. Thus, it was irrelevant that there were alleged inconsistencies in the wife's testimony.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of the dismissal by the Cleveland Municipal Court (Ohio) of aggravated disorderly conduct charges against defendants. The city contended the trial court erred in granting the motions to dismiss because it improperly reached a constitutional issue and because the municipal ordinance at issue was not, in fact, unconstitutionally applied as to defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court concluded that the municipal ordinance at issue was unconstitutionally overbroad in three of the five cases before it, using as the critical consideration in its analysis whether a particular defendant was physically blocking traffic or simply standing on a curb talking with drivers who had chosen to stop their cars, thereby blocking traffic. The court found that such a distinction had no relationship with the overbreadth doctrine in that defendants' conduct was not constitutionally protected. In reversing, the court found that the trial court apparently analyzed the sufficiency of the evidence in making the distinctions that it did despite the fact that the legal sufficiency of the evidence could not be properly raised in a pretrial motion to dismiss. Although noting there was some evidence that the prostitutes were being charged under the ordinance while the drivers who stopped were not, the court found no evidence that the police practice in this regard was invidious or in bad faith, and thus found no merit to defendants' claim of selective or discriminatory prosecution.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 2907.02, an aggravated felony of the first degree and the court affirmed. The court affirmed because it found that the lower court properly admitted into evidence the results of an analysis of defendant's blood and saliva samples that were obtained through a legal search and seizure. The court found the samples were properly obtained because there was a clear indication since defendant had been identified by the victim and indicted by the grand jury. The court found that the test was reasonable since extraction of blood and a saliva test were reasonable, commonplace, and involved a procedure with virtually no risk of harm, trauma, or pain and that the test was performed in a reasonable manner. The court found the procedure used to obtain the samples did not violate defendant's U.S. Const. amend. VI rights since there is a minimal risk that his counsel's absence at such analyses could have derogated his right to a free trial. The court found Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2317.47 was sufficiently broad to authorize the tests because the identity of the perpetrator was in question.</SPAN></P>

The Board recommended that he file a current agricultural use valuation (CAUV) application, and the tax valuations under the CAUV were greatly reduced. The Board affirmed the valuation contained in the original tax billing, but the property owner's tax liability was reduced because he elected to utilize the alternative CAUV valuation. The property filed a complaint in the trial court seeking a determination that the value of his land was only that of a poor grade of farmland, but the trial court, after finding that the action was in fact an appeal of the Board's decision, dismissed it as moot. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not err in finding that the property owner's appeal was moot because any appeal from the Board's decision had to be in reference to the true value assessment. However, the property owner elected not to have his property taxed at its true value when he applied for and was granted CAUV status.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessee applied to the zoning inspector for a variance from Ordinance F-82 in order to drill for oil and gas on property zoned for residential uses. The inspector denied the application and the Zoning Board upheld the inspector's decision. The common pleas court ruled that the limitation on drilling contained in the ordinance was in direct conflict with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1509.40 and was illegal and void as applied to the lessee. The ordinance impermissibly restricted the lessee's right to drill for gas and oil, according to the common pleas court decision. On appeal, the court overturned the common pleas court judgment, first holding that the reasonableness of prohibiting drilling in residential areas was fairly debatable, and therefore, not subject to judicial interference. The drilling limitations were reasonably related to public health, welfare, and safety, and were a legitimate exercise of the police power. The court also ruled that the common pleas court erred when it found that a conflict existed between Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1509.40 (amended 1985) and Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the counts of the indictments pertaining to the possession of criminal tools. The State argued that the trial court's ruling that Ohio Rev.

The court held that a plain reading of the trial court's opinion disclosed that the emphasized statutory section the trial court actually referred to was Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.04(A)(4), dealing with criminal conspiracies, and was misquoted by the State. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.24 failed for vagueness because it failed to fairly warn persons of ordinary intelligence as to what were the prohibited criminal uses. The court held that a statute, such as this, which prohibited the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must, of necessity, guess at its meaning, or disagree as to its application, was violative of the first indicia of due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents brought the claim when the patient was 18 after it was discovered that the surgeon's removal of a portion of the patient's uvula during a tonsillectomy when the patient was 11 years old caused choking and difficulty breathing. On appeal, the parent's argued that the trial court's application of Ohio Rev.

The court held that &sect; 2305.11 provided a reasonable time within which to file a complaint.

The court rejected the parents' argument that the four year statute of limitations contained in &sect; 2305.11(B) was tolled by the fraudulent concealment of the surgeon's negligence. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment because the cause of action did not involve the discovery of a &quot;foreign object&quot; and the statute of limitations contained &sect; 2305.11(B) was not tolled by any allegations of fraudulent concealment or by the discovery rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant voluntarily pleaded guilty to the two counts of aggravated robbery. Both counts retained the violence specifications but the gun specification was deleted from one count. Defendant also pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful possession of a dangerous ordinance with a gun specification and violence specification as indicted. On appeal, defendant attacked the validity of the three-year mandatory term imposed upon him pursuant to the gun specification of the indictment for unlawful possession of a dangerous ordinance. The essence of defendant's contention was that because the unlawful possession of a dangerous ordinance charge, to wit, a loaded sawed off shotgun, contained a gun specification concerning the same sawed off shotgun, the imposition of a gun specification was improper. The court held that defendant's three-year mandatory non-probational sentence pursuant to the gun specification in the indictment for unlawful possession of a dangerous ordinance was proper. The court further held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.71(B) was not void for vagueness and did not violate due process beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of running a red light in violation of Warrensville Heights, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 313.03(c). He appealed from the judgment of the Bedford Municipal Court (Ohio), contending that a penalty section of Warrensville Heights, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 313.03(c) was unconstitutional in light of Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 715.67 and that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A patrolman testified that he saw defendant drive his car through a red light and that the traffic light was properly functioning. The court held that the conviction was supported by the patrolman's testimony. Warrensville Heights, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 313.03(c) was not unconstitutional. Under Warrensville Heights, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 303.99, the penalty for violating Warrensville Heights, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 313.03(c) was imprisonment of up to six months and a fine of up to $ 1,000. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 715.67 provided that a city could make a violation of any of its ordinances a misdemeanor, but that any fine imposed for punishment could not exceed $ 500. Though the fine of Warrensville Heights, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 313.03(c) did exceed the limit imposed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 715.67, it did not change the degree of the offense from a misdemeanor to a felony. Thus, Warrensville Heights, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 313.03(c) was not in conflict with a general law of the State of Ohio; nor was it arbitrary, discriminatory, capricious, or unreasonable in its application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that convicted defendant of running a red light.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the grandson of the decedent, sought review of a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Butler County (Ohio), which dismissed the grandson's action against appellee, the estate of the grandfather. The grandson's complaint alleged that he was denied due process when he was not served with a notice of the probate of his grandfather's estate 18 years earlier.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandson claimed that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2107.13 was unconstitutional because it did not require that he be given notice of the probating of his grandfather's will. The grandson did not find out that his grandfather had died until 18 years after the grandfather's death. The court agreed that &sect; 2107.13 was not unconstitutional. The trial court properly dismissed the grandson's action for failure to state a claim. The grandson had a property interest, but every property interest did not require the same level of due process. Rather, the degree of procedural protection due a given property interest varies, based upon a balancing of the interest at stake in a given proceeding, in light of its practical application to the affairs of men as they are ordinarily conducted. A trial type hearing was not required in every conceivable case of government impairment of private interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant built a vehicle to haul agricultural products. The drawbar was 12 feet one inch long. The distance between the axles was 23 feet one inch The State inspected and approved the vehicle. Later he was cited for having a too long drawbar. The trial court found Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4513.32 irrelevant and found defendant guilty under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5577.04. Defendant argued that it was error to fail to reconcile the two conflicting statutes. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4513.32 and 5577.04 were inconsistent. The former required a towing vehicle to have a drawbar that did not exceed 15 feet; the latter required that the distance between the nearest axles could not exceed 12 feet six inches. The court found that the provision in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5577.04 was oddly misplaced in a section dealing primarily with vehicle and axle weights. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4513.32 was specifically designed to impose drawbar requirements on towing vehicles. The court gave effect to the provision specifically tailored to the issue, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4513.32, which was controlling. Defendant's drawbar was within the 15 feet allowed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4513.32.</SPAN></P>

The State appealed, contending that the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint on its own motion and in finding Lima, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 618.16(B) unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Lima, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 618.16(B) provided that no person could keep or harbor more than one pit bull dog at his residence. The court held that Lima, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 618.16(B) was not unconstitutionally vague. In determining whether a criminal statute was unconstitutional for vagueness or uncertainty, the test was whether it was understandable to a person of ordinary intelligence who was subject to its penalties. The court extensively reviewed dictionary, trade, breeder, and other definitions of the breed of dogs known as pit bulls and determined that that particular breed had characteristics generally conforming to the definitions it had reviewed. The issue of whether any particular animal fell with that classification was one of fact to be determined by the evidence presented. The trial court erred in dismissing the complaint upon its own motion because it provided no opportunity for the State to argue the issue of unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessees owned leases on several properties that were located in an R-1 zoned district.

The trial court found that the zoning inspector and the board of trustees had the authority to regulate the placement of oil and gas wells in residential districts. The lessees appealed from that judgment, which was reversed. The matter was remanded. The court found that the State of Ohio had preempted the issuance of permits for the drilling of oil and gas wells in townships. However, a township had the authority to enact and enforce health and safety standards governing the extraction of oil and gas, subject to the limitations imposed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1509.39. In that regard, the trial court's decision upholding the township's blanket prohibition against such activity in R-1 districts was against the manifest weight of the evidence because no evidence suggested that it was related to the public's health and safety.</SPAN></P>

The trial court enjoined the township from any attempt restrict the corporation's use of its premises, land and buildings for agricultural purposes.

The complainant claimed that defendants were acting under color of state law. The trial court, apparently relying upon Ohio's limitations statute for personal injury claims, based upon an intervening decision of the United States Supreme Court, granted summary judgment in favor of defendants and dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held that the rule enunciated in the United States Supreme Court decision was applicable to cases that were pending at the time the decision was rendered. The court ruled that as a result, the claim was time-barred by Ohio's one-year statute of limitations pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11. The court held that the decision of the United States Supreme Court was applied retroactively because its application would not be harsh, unjust, or inequitable.

The court also found that there was an adequate constitutional basis for distinguishing between divorced and non-divorced family situations with regard to visitation.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3109.05 was a valid means for the State to assert a compelling governmental interest in assuring that a child would receive the attention, care, and concern that he would have received if the marriage had not ended in divorce. The court determined that the child's adoption by his stepfather did not terminate the trial court's power to determine the grandparents' visitation rights and that &sect; 3109.05 permitted the trial court to award reasonable visitation rights to anyone that had an interest in the child's welfare, including the parents of the custodial parent. The statute did not limit the award of visitation rights to the family and friends of the noncustodial parent.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from her convictions in the Hamilton County Municipal Court (Ohio) for disorderly conduct, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11, and direct contempt, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2705.01. Defendant was sentenced to 30 days' incarceration on each charge, to be served concurrently, probation for one year, and the trial court imposed a fine of $ 288.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant started a struggle in a courtroom where her son was appearing on traffic charges. At the trial of the disorderly conduct and contempt charges resulting from that altercation, defendant informed the municipal court that she wished to be represented by a pastor, who was not an attorney. The municipal court declined to allow the pastor to represent defendant, who then refused appointed counsel and the offer of an attorney to assist her in the presentation of her case. On appeal, defendant argued that the municipal court erred when it did not prove jurisdiction over her and in not providing her with a jury of 12 persons. The court affirmed. Both offenses with which defendant was charged occurred at an area court in the county. Therefore, the municipal court had jurisdiction to proceed against defendant under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.11. Ohio R. Crim. P. 23 provided that eight jurors served in misdemeanor cases. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11(A)(1) was constitutional on its face and as applied to defendant. There was no abuse of defendant's right to due process in the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Chief of the Division of Reclamation of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, challenged an order of the Ohio Reclamation Board of Review adopting a hearing officer's report, which concluded that the Chief's issuance of a civil penalty under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 1513 to appellee, the surety of a coal company, for failing to properly reclaim a permit site was an unconstitutional retroactive application of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Division issued a permit to the company, and the surety executed reclamation performance bonds to cover the site. When the company failed to perform reclamation, the surety exercised its right under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1513.16(H) to reclaim the site rather than pay the face amount of the bonds. After the surety chose to reclaim the land, the legislature granted the Chief authority under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1513.02(F)(1) to issue civil penalties for failure to properly reclaim permit sites. When the surety failed to take remedial steps, the Chief assessed a civil penalty against it. The hearing officer vacated the penalty, concluding that because the surety issued the bonds before the civil penalty provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 1513 were enacted, the penalty assessed against the surety was an unconstitutional retroactive application of the law. The Board adopted the hearing officer's report, and on appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the civil penalty provisions of ch. 1513 did not infringe upon U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 because they did not add any new conditions to the surety contract but, rather, enlarged the conditions for the option of reclamation.</SPAN></P>

A jury found him guilty of aggravated robbery and the gun specification. The trial court, in sentencing, determined that the portion of Ohio Rev.

The State appealed, and the court reversed, holding that the portion of &sect; 2929.71 mandating a three-year consecutive sentence to the basic crime of aggravated robbery was constitutional and did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. The court found that the three-year term of actual incarceration was to be served in addition to imposition of any other authorized sentence. Thus, the trial court should have followed the mandate of &sect; 2929.71 by imposing the three-year term of actual incarceration consecutive to the sentence imposed for the aggravated robbery itself.</SPAN></P>

The board upheld the inspector's denial. The home filed a notice of appeal in the trial court, which reversed the board's decision. On further appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court was permitted to hear additional evidence under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.03(C) where none of the testimony at the hearing before the board was given under oath. The court also held that the trial court used the correct standard of review under Ohio Rev.

The facility would be a convalescent home for children where it would help children to recover health and strength after abuse or neglect.

The court held that: (1) the evidence against first defendant was irreconcilable with any theory of innocence, and thus, he was properly convicted as an aider and abettor to the kidnapping and felonious assault of the victim; (2) evidence of first defendant's violent behavior around his girlfriend and his supplying her with cocaine was relevant to establish his motive, and the probative value of such evidence outweighed its prejudicial impact; (3) an in camera inspection of the victim's medical records was not necessary as both defendants were permitted to extensively cross-examine her about her mental illness; (4) first defendant's confession was properly admitted as police orally advised him of his Miranda rights and had him read and sign a form entitled &quot;Specific Warning Regarding Interrogation;&quot; and (5) first defendant was properly sentenced as such punishment was on a relative scale proportionate to the offenses.

</DIV>

On appeal, the court held that it was not error for the trial court to raise with the jury the issue of the effect of any alcohol the employee consumed on his ability to drive because the evidence raised an inference of alcohol influence. The court determined that the trial court improperly denied the employee and employer's counsel the opportunity to independently examine witnesses who were not the agents of the employee or the driver. The court also decided that prejudgment interest was not necessary to make the driver whole because he bore some fault in the accident and the settlement efforts on both sides were minimal. Last, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying admission of an unabridged booklet of the driver's medical data because the employee and his employer made no effort to separate the relevant and non-relevant information.</SPAN></P>

Next we find that the aggravating circumstances of this case outweigh any and all mitigation factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, we hold that the sentence of death is appropriate in this case, as it is neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.

On appeal, defendant contended, among other things, that the trial court erred in denying his motions to dismiss and for a mistrial, the death penalty was unconstitutional, and the bifurcated penalties prevented him from having effective assistance of counsel. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to convict because defendant was the sole occupant of the cell, defendant was observed by other inmates fashioning a weapon from a mop bucket handle, he had expressed some animosity toward the correctional officers for their alleged failure to allow him his full give minutes of telephone time, and the correctional officer was a peace officer. The court held that the testimony alleging that defendant had a pending murder charge at the time of the offense was improper; however, the trial court's curative instruction rendered any error harmless. The court determined that the aggravating circumstances of the case outweighed any and all mitigation factors beyond a reasonable doubt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mining company argued that its failure to file objections to the administrative agency's report did not constitute a failure to exhaust its administrative remedies and did not bar it from filing a direct appeal. The court agreed with the mining company and found that the mining company's failure to object to the administrative agency's report did not preclude the mining company's right to appeal. The mining company also argued that the application of standards that did not exist until after the permits were issued amounted to an unconstitutional retroactive application of the law. The mining company further argued that the government agency's notice of the violations failed to comply with the specificity requirements of Ohio Rev. Code. Ann. &sect; 1513.02(D)(4). The court rejected both of these arguments. The court noted that the law specifically provided that a civil penalty did not violate Ohio Const. art II, &sect; 28 where the civil penalty was enacted as an enhancement of previous existing law and the violation occurred after the date of the penalty provision. The court also found that the notice of the violations sufficiently notified the mining company of the allegations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a federal investigation, defendant was implicated by two suspects as possessing negatives of child pornography and his name was on a mailing list. Police obtained a warrant to search defendant's home and found four photographs depicting a nude young boy. Defendant's motion to suppress was denied and he was subsequently convicted. He appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that &sect; 2907.323(A)(3) was not vague or overbroad and it did not violate defendant's right to privacy because possession of child pornography was not protected by the First Amendment. Although the term &quot;minor&quot; was not defined in &sect; 2907.323(A)(3), its common and ordinary meaning was a person under 18 years old. The totality of the circumstances established probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant. The photographs were relevant and admissible to prove defendant's possession of them and authentication of the photographs was not necessary. The evidence was sufficient to overcome a motion for acquittal because the photographs manifestly showed a young boy in a state of nudity involving lewdness, eroticism, lechery, salaciousness, voyeurism, or other exploitative, unwholesome motivations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee judgment creditor obtained a default judgment against appellant judgment debtor in a foreign jurisdiction. The judgment creditor brought legal proceedings in Ohio to recover the judgment. The judgment debtor moved for relief from judgment, pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 60(B).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment debtor sought relief from the default judgment on the ground that it was void for a lack of personal jurisdiction. In denying relief from judgment, the common pleas court determined that the foreign court had jurisdiction to render the default judgment because the judgment debtor made a voluntary appearance before it and that, thus, the judgment debtor could not collaterally attack the default judgment. On appeal, the judgment debtor contended, among other things, that the common pleas court erred in finding that it made a voluntary appearance in the foreign court. The court held that the judgment debtor voluntarily appeared in the foreign court by way of a letter to that court that it intended to contest the matter through its attorney; the filing of an answer was not necessary to constitute a general appearance. The foreign jurisdiction's long-arm statute was constitutional and was properly applied in the case. Because the judgment debtor had appeared before the foreign court, it could not collaterally attack the default judgment. Moreover, the default judgment was not void because the foreign court acquired proper personal jurisdiction over the judgment debtor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer was responding to a silent burglar alarm at a bank when he struck a vehicle at an intersection being operated by the decedent. The decedent was killed in the accident, and the decedent's relative filed a wrongful death action against defendants. Summary judgment was granted for defendants on grounds of their immunity from civil liability under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 701.02. The common pleas court denied the relative's motions to vacate and for leave to amend the complaint. Affirming for defendants, the court held that the common pleas court could not be faulted for finding that the officer was on an &quot;emergency call&quot; at the time of the accident, which afforded him the immunity provided in &sect; 701.02. The urgent call to duty rather than the actual degree of danger triggered the officer's immunity. Section 701.02 was not an unconstitutional arbitrary exercise of police power because there was a continuing legislative believe in the validity and importance of the policy served by the immunity statute. The relative's motion to amend was properly denied because there were no allegations of newly discovered facts or any change of circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient argued that the trial court's application of Ohio Rev.

He argued that the application of &sect; 2305.11(B), the four year statute of limitations, to minor medical malpractice litigants unconstitutionally deprived him of equal protection. He challenged the distinction between minor medical malpractice litigants and all other minor litigants in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.16. Minor tort claimants were allowed until they turned 18 to bring claims but Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(B) limited minor medical malpractice litigants to four years. The court upheld the dismissal. The reasonableness ameliorated the evil of retroactivity that would have otherwise rendered the statute unenforceable. There was no fundamental right or suspect class involved in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(B). The purpose of the litigation was to insure continuing health care. The legislature was concerned with delayed proof, and the decision to negate the tolling effect in Ohio Rev.

The court held that it was not arbitrary, indiscriminate, or whimsical to limit approval of seminars for the minimal 12-hour educational training required for re-licensing of Ohio chiropractors to seminars held in Ohio.

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2945.73(B), 2945.71(C) and counsel's acquiescence in the removal of the alternate juror without consultation. After the motion was denied, review was sought. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21, the court refused to review all but two of the allegations because defendant failed to present operative facts supporting all the allegations. After noting that res judicata did not bar the issue, the court held that counsel was not ineffective in failing to move for discharge for lack of a speedy trial because defendant's motion to suppress extended the applicable time period. Likewise, the court held that counsel was not ineffective in acquiescing in the removal of the alternate juror because defendant failed to demonstrate that an essential duty was violated and that the defense was prejudiced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner filed a replevin action against the city to recover guns seized by police. The trial court denied recovery, holding that the owner could not lawfully possess guns because he was a chronic alcoholic and thus under a disability pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.13(A)(4). The owner appealed, arguing that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.14, providing relief from a disability, was unconstitutional as applied to him because it did not provide relief for a reformed chronic alcoholic. The court held that &sect; 2923.14 did not apply because it only provided relief from a previously determined disability, and the owner had not been previously adjudicated as having a disability. Further, there was no evidence to support the owner's claim that he was reformed; rather, implicit in the trial court's order was a finding that he was still a chronic alcoholic. Also, even assuming that &sect; 2923.14 was applicable, the owner's argument as to its unconstitutionality was without merit; if he had been able to prove that he was not a chronic alcoholic, such disability would have ceased to exist and the trial court would have had the authority to order return of the guns notwithstanding &sect; 2923.14.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment by a three-judge panel of the Court of Common Pleas of Butler County (Ohio), which found him guilty of aggravated murder, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01(A), with a firearm specification. The panel sentenced defendant to death after finding that the aggravating circumstance of the murder outweighed the mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant waived his right to a jury and a three-judge panel heard the evidence, found him guilty, and moved on to the penalty phase. Thereafter, the panel determined that the aggravating circumstance outweighed any mitigating factors, and defendant was sentenced to death. Some of those factors were the planned purchase of the gun and ammunition and a prior conviction for manslaughter. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding first that Ohio's statutory framework for imposition of capital punishment, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2929.03, 2929.04, and 2929.05, was not unconstitutional. Further, although the court agreed that the panel improperly considered aggravating circumstances not set for under &sect; 2929.04(A)(1) through (8), it did not require resentencing. The evidence that supported the defective aggravating circumstance was otherwise admissible and duplicative. Also, the court's independent findings, as required by &sect; 2929.05(A), was a safeguard against any possibility of error in the panel's judgment. Finally, the court ruled that the death penalty was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business owner received a use permit for the retail sales of news and books. The business owner later applied to change the use to an adult bookstore and an adult mini-motion picture theater. The request was denied because the operation was within 1,000 feet of an existing adult bookstore and a mini-motion picture theater. The board of zoning appeals denied the business owner a use variance, and the trial court affirmed that decision. The court reversed and remanded the case. The court noted that the property was located in a general retail business district subject to Cleveland, Ohio, Zoning Code &sect; 343.11(b). The court held that adult bookstores in a general retail area were subject to the spacing requirements of Cleveland, Ohio, Zoning Code &sect; 343.01(b)(2)(E), and adult theaters were subject to Cleveland, Ohio, Zoning Code &sect; 343.11(B)(2)(L). The court noted that outstanding permits existed for two of the regulated uses at the time of the business owner's application. The court concluded that the issues of the constitutionality of the zoning restrictions should have been tried originally in the trial court rather than summarily dismissed without a hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two appeals, defendant challenged two decisions of the Guernsey County Common Pleas Court (Ohio). The first was defendant's death sentence. The second was trial court's refusal to grant defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea, which lead to his convictions for aggravated murder and attempted aggravated murder. Defendant was also convicted of certain specifications.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to defendant's guilty pleas and sentence, a co-defendant was tried before a jury for the identical crimes. The co-defendant was found guilty but sentenced to life imprisonment. At the co-defendant' trial, an inmate of the jail testified that the co-defendant had admitted to shooting the victim. Based on this testimony, defendant moved to withdraw his guilty plea. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in overruling said motion and in sentencing him to death. The court affirmed the judgments. In doing so, the court rejected the argument that where two or more persons acted in concert as principal offenders none could have been lawfully executed unless all were. The court also found no error in the trial court's weighing of the aggravating and mitigating factors because the weight of such factors was for the trial of fact. The court also found in its independent review that the aggravating circumstances (the killing the victim to silence her as a witness to the robbery and the gun specification) outweighed the many mitigating factors. As a matter of law the intentional killing of a witness was entitled to great weight.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4549.07.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vehicle's dashboard identification number (VIN) and legible portion of its confidential VIN did not match. The complaint against defendant was based on Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2933.41(C), which allowed a government unit in possession of certain forms of previously-seized property to bring an action to terminate the rights of other persons in such property. Defendant claimed that he was entitled to the vehicle by virtue of a Florida used car sales form and registration and Ohio title documents. The State argued that defendant was not entitled to the vehicle under any circumstances. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court committed prejudicial error in not granting his motion for dismissal at the close of the State's evidence and at the close of all of the evidence. The court raised the issue of the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4549.07 sua sponte. The court disagreed with the State that confiscation was justified. If it is unlawful to possess a vehicle with mismatched VINs, a prospective purchaser of the vehicle should be able to check the two VIN locations. Defendant was an innocent bona fide purchaser for value.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was drinking with several other individuals including defendant in an apartment.

No arrests were made at that time. Following the departure of the police, a witness testified that he drove defendant to a place where he got her two or three more drinks and then took her back to her car near the apartment building. Two other witnesses testified that they saw defendant ascend the stairway in the building, go to the victim's apartment, and shoot her. Defendant appealed her conviction for aggravated assault. The court found that the jury found defendant guilty of the greater offense of attempted voluntary manslaughter because it found the element of attempting to cause death rather than attempting to cause harm, that the trial court properly modified the jury instructions to accommodate the fact that the victim survived, that she was not entitled to the true man defense because she was not trying to defend herself, and there was more than ample evidence to sustain the verdict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted, pursuant to a no contest plea, of two counts of felonious assault and two counts of assault. On appeal, defendant first argued that the trial court erred in determining that, as a repeat offender, he was ineligible for treatment in lieu of conviction. The court rejected this argument and noted that defendant's prior conviction for a crime of violence as well as a conviction of domestic violence made him a repeat offender under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.01(A)(1 and, thus, was conclusively ineligible for treatment in lieu of conviction under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2951.041. The court then noted that the trial court substantially complied with Ohio R. Crim. P. 11(C) when it told defendant of the possible sentences that could be imposed and defendant indicated that he understood. The court then found that the trial court did not have to allow defendant to present evidence or take any testimony upon entry of a no contest plea.

She brought an action against the employer alleging defamation and deprivation of a property interest and the trial court granted summary judgment. On appeal, the court held that although the employee raised factual issues concerning the employer's other employees' communications concerning the employee's activities, the communications fell under the qualified privilege that arose in work situations. The employee failed to prove that such comments were made with actual malice, so summary judgment was proper. Regardless of whether the employee was a tenured employee or a non-classified, terminable at-will employee, she was given notice and a sufficient due process hearing guaranteed to tenured employees. Because the employee's complaint did not allege that her administrative remedy was constitutionally defective, nor did it state an otherwise good cause of action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, her failure to exhaust administrative remedies was fatal to her claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the police discovered a burglar alarm sounding at a cafe, they found the door to the cafe open with no one inside. The police then learned that the owner of the cafe, the victim, had not returned home after his night shift. A search of the cafe revealed that a gun was missing. Later, the police learned that the victim's body was found alongside a road with a gunshot wound. Subsequently, defendant was arrested while driving the victim's car. The gun that killed the victim was found in the car. Evidence showed that both the victim and defendant were intoxicated the night of the incident and that others saw them together at the cafe in the early morning hours. Defendant told police that she stole the gun from the cafe, that she demanded the victim's wallet while she was a passenger in his car, and that the gun went off by accident. The court held that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter and on the defense of intoxication. The court further held that, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.05(A), the death penalty was not appropriate only because of the errors perceived in the guilt phase of the trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and a specification for a prior rape conviction by the trial court. Defendant appealed. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that the trial court did not commit reversible error. The court found that involuntary manslaughter was a crime of lesser degree than aggravated murder where the essential elements of felonious assault, the knowing cause of serious physical harm to another, were intermixed in the elements of aggravated murder. The court noted that one of the elements of aggravated murder was not an element of involuntary manslaughter. The court found that the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on the statutory definition of &quot;firearm&quot; was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where defendant admitted to firing the gun, a witness saw him fire the gun, and the gun was received into evidence with a spent shell for the jury to examine. The court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the maximum sentence where the mandated statutory factors did not require a presentence report and there was no request made by defendant for one.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 3767.01, the nuisance statute, was not unconstitutional on its face or as applied to the owners, and there was not an arbitrary taking of property without due process. An injunction was properly issued as there was proof of the owners' culpable knowledge, and the injunctive relief was authorized by statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ethanol manufacturer brought an action challenging the constitutionality of the 1984 amendment to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5735.145(B), seeking both declaratory and injunctive relief. Section 5735.145(B) provided for a qualified fuel credit for fuel not containing ethanol produced outside of Ohio unless the fuel contained ethanol produced in a state that also granted an exemption. The trial court held, among other things, that the statute was constitutionally enforceable since the manufacturer had demonstrated no violation of the Commerce Clause. The manufacturer appealed and the appellate court affirmed. It held that the statute did not violate the Commerce Clause because the tax legislation did not ban the sale of products in Ohio manufactured in other states not having a reciprocal provision. The tax did not grant a credit solely for Ohio produced ethanol. The tax did not tax the use of ethanol differently on whether the ethanol was produced in Ohio or out of Ohio and it did not apply a direct commercial advantage to all Ohio producers over all out-of-state producers. Hence, the statute was not used as a device to provide a commerce advantage to in-state competitors.</SPAN></P>

Testing established that the victim's gun had not been fired but that defendant's gun had been fired. A jury found defendant guilty of murder. The trial court found defendant guilty of a gun specification at a separate trial. Defendant claimed on appeal that the jury should have been instructed on voluntary manslaughter, that the instruction that placed the burden upon defendant to prove self-defense violated due process, and that the sentence under Ohio's gun law was unconstitutional. The court rejected defendant's claims. The court ruled that the evidence did not support a manslaughter instruction because the shooting took place the day after the victim threatened defendant, that defendant did in fact have the burden of proving self-defense, and that an actual incarceration sentence on the firearm specification did not violate double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the company failed to establish that the reasonableness of the current ordinance was beyond the reach of fair debate. The court also stated that it could not conclude that if the company's land remained zoned for single family use it would be so unreasonable as to violate the company's constitutional guarantees. The court noted that the property had appreciated in value and that the issue of whether it could be made more profitable by development was debatable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought to dismiss the indictments on the ground that the statutes on which the indictments were based were unconstitutionally vague, ambiguous, and overbroad. The trial court concluded that Ohio Rev. Code Ann &sect; 2907.323(A) was unconstitutionally overbroad and dismissed the charges for illegal use of minor in nudity-oriented material. The trial court also dismissed the child endangering charges on the basis that the indictment and bill of particulars did not state an offense absent any allegations that defendants' conduct was aimed at the distribution of the pictures. The court affirmed the dismissal of the charges for illegal use of minor in nudity-oriented material, holding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.323 was facially invalid for overbreadth because nudity per se was constitutionally protected speech under the First Amendment. However, the court reversed the dismissal of the child endangering charges, holding that Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged after cocaine and drug paraphernalia were found in his residence subject to a search warrant. The confiscated items had defendant's fingerprints on them. Defendant contended that the trial court had erred in charging the jury on the &quot;use&quot; portion of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.11 because use could not constitute a lesser-included offense to &sect; 2925.03(A)(6). The court concluded that the trial court's error was harmless because the State's evidence of possession of cocaine was overwhelming and there was no miscarriage of justice. The court rejected defendant's First Amendment challenge to the portion of &sect; 2925.11(A), which proscribed &quot;use&quot; of a controlled substance, because nothing in U.S. Const. amend. I remotely prohibited the states from enacting legislation regarding controlled substances. The court found the circumstantial evidence sufficient to enable the jury to exclude a reasonable hypothesis of defendant's innocence. The trial court had properly denied defendant's motion to suppress because the magistrate, who had issued the search warrant, had been neutral and detached and had made a searching and detailed probable cause assessment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found in possession of pictures of nude children that focused on their genitals. After the trial court overruled defendant's motion to suppress the materials upon which the charge was based, defendant entered a plea of no contest and was found guilty. On appeal, the court held &sect; 2907.323(A)(3) was not vague because when read in its entirety, it addressed depictions of nudity that were devoid of any legitimate purpose, such as artistic, medical, scientific, educational, religious, governmental, judicial, or some other wholesome purpose. A drafting error did not invalidate the statute because it was clear what the legislature had intended, so the court construed the former version of the statute as exempting from prosecution a parent who was in possession of materials showing his own child in a state of nudity. Defendant had advised his son that he defendant was gathering his illegal photographs in order to get rid of them, so there was adequate information upon which a search warrant was issued.</SPAN></P>

In an action by the wife, the husband was ordered to pay the wife an amount equal to the cost of each child's tuition, fees, books, and required supplies, less weekly support payments. Additional information was to be provided to the trial court to determine the father's ability to pay. No additional information was submitted to the trial court. The father appealed. The court affirmed on appeal, finding no error. The court found that the father had agreed to pay college expenses. The contract merged into the decree. Thus, no contract defenses could apply to it.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had repeatedly raped the victim over a five-hour period. While he had been charged with one count of having a weapon under a disability, the jury specifically found that he had not used a gun. Defendant contended that the enhancement provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.11 were unconstitutional. The court noted that the enhancement of a penalty by a prior conviction had been upheld. Defendant also contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress, in not accepting his waiver of a jury as to the specification of a prior offense, and in limiting the victim's cross-examination. The court found that the motion to suppress was properly denied because the warrant and nighttime search were proper. The error in refusing defendant's jury waiver was harmless. The cross-examination had been properly restricted because the information sought was precluded by &sect; 2907.02. The court found the aggravated robbery verdict internally inconsistent because the indictment alleged that he had had a gun. The prosecution conceded that the trial court had erred in imposing a sentence that exceeded the maximum aggregate 15-year sentence provided for in &sect; 2929.41(E)(2).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of failing to repair unevenness in her sidewalk after she was cited by the city building inspector. She asserted that South Euclid, Ohio, Ordinance 1411.03 (1973) was unconstitutional in that it permitted a building inspector to inspect her property without her consent. The court disagreed, the ordinance provided for proper notice of the inspection and, as the inspection did not involve the inside of defendant's house, her consent was not needed. Further, although notice of the inspection was mailed to defendant, she did not object to the proposed inspection. Thus, she implicitly consented. She next contended that South Euclid, Ohio, Ordinance 905.02 (1976) was unconstitutionally vague because it did not provide what kind of sidewalk repairs were acceptable. She had repaired the unevenness with black top. The city contended that the repair did not satisfy the ordinance. The court held that the statute and a notice regarding how to make the repair, which was provided to defendant, were sufficiently clear and to advise defendant that the sidewalk had to be repaired with cement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court treated defendant as a first offender at the time of sentencing by imposing a term of actual incarceration short of the 10-day period provided by the second-offense penalty of Ohio Rev.

Defendant contended that the State did not allege the prior conviction; thus, the offense was never elevated into a second-time offense. The court agreed with the State, vacating the sentence. The court found that the sentencing statute for the offense did not elevate an offense of a lower degree of classification to one of a higher degree. It only dictated sentencing options. Thus, the State was not required to allege the prior conviction as part of the offense itself. Defendant, therefore, should have been sentenced as a second-time offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of engaging in sexual activity with a person who suffered from mental retardation. The State's case depended on a showing (1) that the victim's ability either to appraise the nature of, or to control, his own conduct was substantially impaired and (2) that the impairment was sufficiently obvious that defendant was aware of it. Two State experts and two defense experts testified as to the victim's mental and psychological status. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in permitting the State to use expert witnesses to evaluate the victim clinically in order to show the existence of a substantial impairment under &sect; 2907.03 because if expert evidence was needed to show that the victim was impaired, then the statute did not give fair warning to persons of ordinary knowledge. The court held that other evidence supported the knowledge element of the crime. Finally, the court held that the trial court did err in denying defense experts an opportunity to clinically evaluate the victim.

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that defendant waived any procedural error by proceeding without objection or request for a continuance. Under the facts, disorderly conduct was a lesser included offense to the charge of assault. The use of the alternate words &quot;violent&quot; behavior in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11 clearly defined the prohibited conduct. Defendant's argument that he had a right to express displeasure when the complainant moved in from of him in line at a pick-up window did not justify foul language, pushing and shoving, and fracturing a bone in the complainant's hand. Defendant was not required to be brought to trial within 30 days under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71. The separate steps required to trigger the commencement of a separate reduced charge did not occur so as to initiate a new time frame. When the charge was reduced at trial to the lesser-included offense without objection, the time within which that minor misdemeanor was to be tried was determined by application of the speedy trial statute to the offense initially charged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

He provided photographs of defendant having sex with young men to the sheriff's department. The police then obtained a search warrant for defendant's home and seized two additional canisters of film. Defendant contended that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.323 was unconstitutionally vague, overbroad, and violated his right to privacy. The court held that the First Amendment did not provide protection to a person privately possessing child pornography of the type possessed by defendant. It held that the evil restricted in the statute overwhelmingly outweighed any possible legitimate interest. The court held that the initial removal of film by his son and the subsequent viewing of them by the police did not constitute an invasion of defendant's Fourth Amendment right to privacy. The court overruled defendant's contention that evidence seized as a result of the search warrant should be suppressed because it was reasonable for the warrant to be issued, as it described the particular place to be searched and the particular items to be seized.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Code Ann. &sect; 4503.10(A)(7). The court held that the president did not satisfy the test for mandamus because he had a plain and adequate legal remedy, a declaratory judgment action, by which his rights under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4503.10 could have been adjudicated. The president also contended &sect; 4503.10 was unconstitutional because the BMV had not demonstrated how his social security number enhanced the public's health, morals, safety or welfare. The BMV argued that the president's interest in the confidentiality of his social security number was outweighed by the state's interest in the integrity of its vehicle registration laws and the execution of its police power. The court agreed and held that there was a legitimate state interest in verifying the identity of those citizens who registered vehicles that would be operated or driven upon the public roads or highways.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the State's prosecution of defendants for violating the criminal laws relating to the storage of hazardous waste material, the trial court issued two pre-trial rulings. The first ruling suppressed physical evidence, 55 gallon drums found buried in an area on property owned by defendant corporation, on the grounds that it was obtained pursuant to an invalid search warrant. The second ruling suppressed the use in the State's case of grand jury testimony of defendants who had been subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury on the grounds that the testimony was compelled absent a warning to defendants that their testimony would be used against them in a subsequent prosecution. The State appealed. The court held that the trial court erred in suppressing the physical evidence because it was obtained in a reasonable, warrantless search of an open field. The trial court also erred in suppressing the grand jury testimony because the absence of self-incrimination warnings did not justify the conclusion that the grand jury testimony was compelled. There was no requirement that a subpoenaed grand jury witness be warned that he was a target of the grand jury investigation.</SPAN></P>

The board sent written notice to all landowners adjacent to the health club that it would be conducting a hearing on the application for variance. Evidence was taken from interested parties. The board granted the variance. On appeal, the property owner argued that it was error for the trial court not to declare void a zoning variance granted in violation of the jurisdictional mandates of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's first assignment of error was that the trial court erred in denying his pre-trial motion to sever the counts in the indictment. The court found that both crimes were committed within a three-day period. In both cases, defendant was driving his mother's blue Cutlass and pulled a gun on his victims. Thus, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling defendant's motion to sever the counts. Defendant further argued that the trial court erred in failing to sever the gun specifications from the trial of the case and that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.141(A) was unconstitutional. The court held that the firearm specification was not a separate offense but was merely an enhancement penalty which was constitutional. Furthermore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting a victim to testify a second time as he admitted he was scared to identify defendant in court.

The court held that the trial court did not err by failing to hold a hearing to allow the owner to present further evidence because Ohio Rev.

The court found that the trial court's transcript was in no way deficient as the owner had alleged.

Further, the court stated that there was no support for the owner's claim that she was not permitted to cross-examine witnesses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The written stipulations established that defendant's children were of compulsory school age, were residents of a certain school district, and were not in attendance in public school.

Both parties then filed trial briefs. Defendant was found guilty of violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3321.38. On appeal, the court stated that the trial of the case on the briefs was an inadequate procedure since no record was properly made at either the trial or the appellate state of the proceedings. The court stated that the only evidence before the trial court, the stipulations, clearly made out a violation of &sect; 3321.38.

The trial court denied his motion to dismiss the charges and convicted him. On appeal, defendant claimed that the statute was unconstitutional because it did not bear a real and substantial relation to any valid interest of the State in protecting the health, safety, morals, or welfare of the public. The court disagreed holding that the statute was a valid exercise of the State's police power because it protected consumers from buying motor vehicles, which had inaccurate odometer readings. The court further held that the statute did bear a real and substantial relationship to public health, safety, and general welfare. The court also rejected defendant's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction. The court held that the evidence demonstrated that defendant acted as the middleman in causing a serviceman to reduce the mileage that was indicated on the odometer. Finally, the court held that the State proved defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The associations had successfully challenged various parts of ordinances that the city had adopted to regulate their sick leave benefits. The city had enacted its latest ordinance to regulate sick leave benefits. It removed the language that the last appellate ruling found improper, but it enacted some limitations similar to provisions in the earlier ordinance. The associations filed a motion to hold the city and its officials in contempt for violating the earlier court order. The trial court denied the motion on the ground that defendants committed no acts in violation of previous court orders. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held that the previous rulings did not directly evaluate any of the ordinance provisions that the associations now challenged. The court ruled that neither the last appellate court order nor the last trial court order expressly directed the city or its officials to do anything. The court held that there was no express order that the city or its officials could have violated. The court ruled that there was not even a declaration that the disputed ordinance language was improper. The court held that there was no basis for a contempt order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issue was whether the adoptive parents used reasonable diligence to ascertain the unknown address of the biological mother when they filed their petition for adoption. Upon review, the court found that the adoptive parents did not use such reasonable diligence. The adoptive parents knew the biological mother and had met her mother and her grandmother. They knew that the biological mother had moved to another state, even though they did not have her street address, and knew of the biological mother's employer but failed to ask about her whereabouts after being told she had married and quit the job. The child's birth certificate revealed the biological mother's maiden name, and there was one person listed under that name in the local phone book. That person was the biological mother's grandmother who knew her address in the other state. The adoptive parents failed to contact the biological mother's grandmother, knew that the biological mother would not have consented to the adoption, and interposed a degree of psychological resistance to the maintenance of either an ongoing relationship or occasional communication between the child and the biological mother.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, arguing 26 assignments of errors. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that an instruction to the jury that advised, which advised that a death recommendation was not binding, was constitutionally permissible. The court pointed out that the better procedure was to have no comment by the prosecutor or the trial judge on the issue of who bore the ultimate responsibility for determining the penalty. The court found that the requirements of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The daughter was allegedly injured by malpractice when she was one year old. She was less than 10 years old when Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(B) was enacted. The parents filed the cause of action when the daughter was 13. After the filing of the action, &sect; 2305.11(B) was declared unconstitutional. In their first assignment of error, the parents argued that it was error to grant summary judgment. Second, they contended that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that their case should be dismissed for failure to prosecute their action. The court overruled the first assignment of error. The court determined that the change in the law as to the applicable statute of limitations for the minor's cause of action was applicable retroactively so as to bar the minor's cause of action. The parents' derivative claim was barred as well. The court overruled the second assignment of error as moot, noting that the trial court took no action on the motions to dismiss for failure to prosecute. The trial court merely expressed its opinion that the action should be have been dismissed for want of prosecution based on the parent's failure to produce evidence at an arbitration proceeding.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the executor's argument that the trial court erred in overruling the motion in limine on the ground that the arbitration award did not contain adequate findings of fact as required by Cuyahoga County, Ohio, Ct. C.P. R. 37. The arbitration panel made a finding as to the ultimate fact in issue upon which its decision was based; thus, the finding issued by the panel was adequate to inform the executor of the reason for the panel's decision. Moreover, the lack of more detailed findings of fact did not relieve the executor of his burden to present evidence to the trial court that the arbitration panel's finding was clearly erroneous, as was necessary to have the decision excluded from evidence. Next, the court held that the limited scope of the finding did not deny the executor his right to cross-examine the arbitrators under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2711.21(D).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant natural mother challenged a decision of the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division (Ohio), which awarded immediate temporary custody of the daughter to appellee human services department, adjudged the daughter a dependent child under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.04(C), and overruled the natural mother's motion to dismiss the complaint on grounds that &sect; 2151.04(C) was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The natural mother contended that the common pleas court erred when it overruled her motion challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 2151.04(C). However, the human services department asserted that the court did not have jurisdiction to consider the appeal because the common pleas court's order overruling the natural mother's motion to dismiss was not a final appealable order. The court dismissed the natural mother's appeal and held that a final appealable order was a prerequisite for the court to exercise its judgment. A truly final judgment was one that ended the litigation and left nothing for the court to do except to execute the judgment. The common pleas court's order overruling the motion to dismiss was not a final appealable order under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2501.01, 2505.02. A finding of dependency, neglect, or abuse and the ordering of a family reunification plan was not a final appealable order. There was a recognition that &quot;time&quot; in the life of a child was different than for an adult, and interlocutory appeals would frustrate this imperative.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought review and contended that the trial court erred in its self-defense instruction to the jury. The court determined that, to establish self-defense, the following elements were to be shown: (1) the slayer was not at fault in creating the situation giving rise to the affray; (2) the slayer had a bona fide belief that he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and that his only means of escape from such danger was in the use of such force; and (3) the slayer had not violated any duty to retreat or avoid the danger. The court further found that self-defense was an affirmative defense for which defendant had the burden or proof. The court held that did not violate constitutional due process and further held that it merely required defendant to show that the victim was the aggressor. The court found that there was substantial evidence to establish that defendant was the aggressor and determined that the trial court had not erred in giving the jury instruction on self-defense.

The trial court had granted summary judgment to the dentist on the ground that the malpractice complaint was barred by the one-year statute of limitations under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(A).

The court noted that the patient filed his action for malpractice over one year after the discovery of his injury. The court rejected the contention that discovery was accomplished only when the patient had not only knowledge of the act causing injury but also knowledge that that act was improper or negligent. Finally, the court agreed with the trial court that the 180-day extension provision of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(A) was inapplicable in dental malpractice claims.

The trial court granted judgment in favor of the Commissioner and the Attorney General and held that the Commissioner was given such power under the statute. The taxpayer sought review. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5703.20, the Commissioner was permitted to subpoena the taxpayer's books and records to make an examination. Further, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5739.13, the Commissioner was authorized to audit the taxpayer's records using any information in his possession. However, the court found that the subpoena power was limited tot he production of records needed in investigations being conducted within the scope of the Commissioner's duty.

The court held that the medical malpractice action accrued when the patient, the son, discovered, or in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, should have discovered, that his injury was a result of malpractice. The court found that the complaint alleged that the son was born with problems that the parents attributed to the doctor's alleged negligent care and treatment of the mother prior to the son's birth. The court did not equate the allegations with a discovery of malpractice by the parents upon the son's birth , when he was allegedly born prematurely with physical and mental problems.

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court rejected the mother's argument that a comprehensive reunification plan (CRP) was required before her rights could be terminated. The court held that the provisions of Ohio Rev.

Here the Board had sought permanent custody, and its award of temporary custody was incidental to the underlying proceedings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for the city as a firefighter and paramedic for nearly 10 years at the time he was discharged by the appointing authority because of a medical disability. At a hearing before the board, the city's medical expert testified that the employee was unable to perform his job duties because of his unstable psychological state due to gender dysphasia. The board affirmed the discharge. Upon appeal by the employee, the city moved for dismissal of the employee's action for lack of prosecution because the discharge was due to disability rather than disciplinary reasons. The trial court vacated the board's decision, finding that the board committed many errors and thus, the employee was not afforded due process. The city appealed, alleging several errors including that the trial court abused its discretion by dismissing the city's motion for lack of prosecution. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, ruling that the city failed to raise the issue of lack of prosecution at trial. Thus, the issue could not be raised for the first time on appeal. The court reversed and remanded to the trial court because the trial court had no authority to remand the matter to the board.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer filed an application with the city for a conditional use permit for the construction of a 52-unit development of clustered homes. The city engineer testified that the appropriate density on the lot was 23 units. Thus, the city denied the developer's permit. The developer argued that the trial court improperly considered the meeting minutes of the city council because such minutes were not a proper part of the city council's record. The court found that the trial court properly considered the city's meeting minutes because the city introduced the minutes as additional evidence when they filed their motion to dismiss. The developer contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to strike the city's reply to the developer's reply brief. The court determined that the trial court should have granted the developer's motion to strike, but found that the trial court's error did not result in prejudice to the developer. The court found that a preponderance of the evidence supported the trial court's judgment, which was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in connection with circulating a false report to television media warning of the collapse of bridges. Defendant, who was a contractor who had performed bridge repairs, intended to gain leverage to air his grievances with the Director of the Ohio Department of Transportation. When defendant's motion to dismiss the charge on the ground that &sect; 2917.31 was unconstitutional was overruled, he entered a plea of no contest and was found guilty by the trial court. On appeal, defendant argued that &sect; 2917.31 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Defendant's conviction was affirmed. The court found that defendant's report was in the nature of a threat. Threats were not a form of speech protected by the First Amendment. Accordingly, the court rejected defendant's argument that his actual conduct could not be regulated under the statute. And, by entering a plea of no contest, he admitted that he did cause serious public alarm by disseminating a false report of an alleged crime that he knew to be false. Furthermore, the language of &sect; 2917.31 provided a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that certain conduct was forbidden.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union members entered the bank to indicate their displeasure with the bank's policies regarding mortgage foreclosures, and specifically the plight of a union staff member's foreclosure proceeding. The bank obtained a temporary restraining order against the union and filed a complaint for damages and a permanent injunction. The trial court enjoined the union from any acts intended to harass the bank or its employees or customers and further ordered the union to limit to six picketers present at any one time in the public area adjacent to the bank's premises. It also ordered the union not to impede entrance or egress from the bank's place of business. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's order limiting the number of the union's picketers to six was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. Therefore, there was no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court. The trial court had the discretion in framing the injunctive order, and it acted within the latitude implied by that discretion. As long as picketing was not forbidden entirely, the trial court's discretion in limiting the number of picketers would be generally be upheld.</SPAN></P>

At the hearing, local residents presented a signed petition, requesting that the preliminary plat be denied based on the potential environmental impacts in the area. Defendant argued that he was denied due process at the hearing because he was not represented by an attorney and witnesses who offered testimony were not required to be under oath. The court held that the owner waived his right to claim procedural defects because he failed to object to such defects. The court further found that the Commission's decision was supported by substantial, reliable, and probative evidence. The owner also argued that the city ordinance that proscribed the requirements for the approval of preliminary plats was invalid because it was inconsistent with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 711.09.

On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the trial court erred in declaring that the results of the election and the proposed charter amendment were null and void because the action of the trial court was made prior to certification. The court would not act to prevent the enactment and rule prospectively on the validity of laws.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In February 1983, the patient filed a second medical malpractice complaint against the physician for injuries she had discovered in October of 1977, and on many occasions soon thereafter, the latest in February or March of 1978. The complaint stated that she had been under the physicians care in June 1978. The physician filed an answer contending, among other things, that the action had not been commenced within the time required by the applicable one year statute of limitations. The trial court granted the physician's motion for summary judgment and, on appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the cause of action for medical malpractice accrued, and the statute of limitations on the patient's action commenced to run, when she discovered her injury. The court found that the new rule on the application of the statutory time period for medical malpractice actions had a retrospective operation and thus barred the patient's malpractice claim. The court found that the retrospective application of the rule had denied the patient her constitutional right to due process because she had no property right in the old rule because a person had no vested interest in any rule of the common law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner pleaded guilty to a violation of &sect; 2925.03, aggravated trafficking. He claimed that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.13 was a separate offense for the use of a motor vehicle in the commission of a drug abuse felony, that forfeiture proceedings were lawful only upon a conviction for violation of &sect; 2925.13, and because he was not convicted of a violation of &sect; 2925.13 it was error to order forfeiture of his van. The court affirmed. The court adopted the findings of the trial court's opinion, which found that &sect; 2925.13 did apply in the instant action and did authorize the confiscation of the owner's van. No forfeiture could be ordered unless there was an expression of law that was clear and the intent of the legislature was manifest. Section 2925.13 was clear that no person should knowingly permit a vehicle to be used for commission of a felony drug abuse offense. The intent of the legislature was to deter the commission of felony drug abuse offenses by confiscation of vehicles used for that activity. The van was used for the commission of a drug abuse felony and could be confiscated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of a common pleas court (Ohio), which entered a jury verdict convicting him of aggravated robbery and felonious assault, both with a gun specification and a prior aggravated felony specification. Defendant was sentenced to three years actual incarceration and an additional consecutive term of 13-to-25 years actual incarceration on each count to run concurrently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the jury had erred in assessing the credibility of the witnesses. The court found that the prosecution's witnesses had been consistent regarding defendant's identity, as the assailant. Defendant's three witnesses had given significantly differing stories regarding the assailant. One even placed defendant at the scene despite his testimony that he had not been in the area for over a year. The court concluded that it was clearly proper for the jury to weigh the credibility of all the witnesses. It also concluded that substantial evidence existed upon which the jury could reasonably conclude that all the elements of the offenses had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, the trial court had properly denied defendant's motion for acquittal on the aggravated robbery charge. Under the facts, the court found that defendant's intent to rob the victim could have been inferred. However, the sentence imposed on the felonious assault count had to be vacated. The offenses were allied, and the State had improperly relied on the same conduct to sustain both convictions. Defendant had failed to show that he had received ineffective assistance of trial counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions, but reversed his sentence for the felonious assault count. The court remanded the case for resentencing and ordered that the State recover its costs from defendant. The court issues a special mandate directing the trial court to carry its judgment into execution and terminated any bail pending appeal.</SPAN></P>
