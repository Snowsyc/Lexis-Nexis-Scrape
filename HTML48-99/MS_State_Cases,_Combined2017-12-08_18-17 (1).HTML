</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants filed an appeal from an order of the Copiah County Circuit Court (Mississippi), granting summary judgment to appellee city, mayor, board, police chief, and police officer, in suit alleging several claims, including violation of appellants' civil rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, violation of constitutional rights and state law claims. Appellants asserted that there were genuine issues as to material facts to preclude summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers arrested and charged appellants for disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and disturbing the peace. Appellants proceeded to trial and were found not guilty by the jury. Subsequently, appellants filed a complaint against appellee city, mayor, board, police chief and police officer in their official and individual capacities, asserting several claims, including violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and several constitutional rights. Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted on the basis of immunity. Appellants filed an appeal. The court affirmed summary judgment for appellees on all claims except the civil rights claims against appellee police chief and police officer in their individual capacities because, based upon sworn affidavits submitted by both parties in response to the motion for summary judgment, there was a genuine dispute as to the material facts of the case. However, the court held that to hold appellee municipality liable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for the misconduct of its employees, appellants had to allege that an official policy or custom was a cause in fact of the deprivation of rights inflicted, which appellants failed to do.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed summary judgment for appellee city, mayor, board, police chief and police officer in their official capacities on all claims filed by appellants alleging civil rights violations. However, summary judgment for claims against appellee police chief and police officer in their individual capacities reversed because, based upon sworn affidavits by both parties, there existed a genuine dispute as to material fact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Panola County Circuit Court (Mississippi) convicting him of forgery in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-21-7 (Rev. 1994) for affixing his signature and acknowledgement to a warranty deed outside the presence of the purported signors of said deed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of forging a warranty deed in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-21-7 (Rev. 1994). Defendant appealed on a variety of grounds. The appeals court affirmed the conviction because the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying defendant's motion to recuse himself where defendant did not produce evidence which overcame presumption that judge was qualified and unbiased. Moreover, the court properly denied defendant's motion for change of venue because there was a proper factual question regarding venue to be presented to the jury, and there was no evidence that defendant was unfairly prejudiced by being tried in that county. Further, court's denial of defendant's motion for a continuance was not an abuse of discretion, and its denial of defendant's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was proper because court could infer that, because jury found defendant guilty, it also found that state presented sufficient evidence to establish proper venue in that county, thus supporting a conviction in that county. Finally, jury instructions were proper, and sentence imposed was not unconstitutional because it was within limits set by legislature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for forgery was affirmed because all of defendant's assignments of error were without merit where the trial judge properly refused to recuse himself, properly presented venue issue to jury, properly denied motions for a continuance and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, properly provided jury with instructions, and imposed a constitutional sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a decision from the Benton County Chancery Court (Mississippi) terminating her parental rights and granting the adoption of her children to her former husband's wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court adjudicated that the best interest of the children required that the natural rights of appellant mother be terminated and that a petition for adoption be granted to appellee stepmother. Appellant challenged this judgment. The court held that it was important to remember that appellant was neither seeking custody of her children nor asking for custody with her abusive husband present. Rather, viewing the record in the light most favorable to appellee father and stepmother, appellant at most wanted to continue to see and be a part of her children's lives. The court held that the facts failed to show that appellant's parental rights should have been terminated. Although her visits with her children were very infrequent, it was not shown that she wished to &quot;relinquish all parental claims to the children&quot; constituting an abandonment. Her conduct did not imply a conscious disregard of all the obligations owed by a parent to the child, leading to the destruction of the parent-child relationship. There was not shown a relinquishment of any parental claim to her children and a laying aside by appellant of all contact with them. The court reversed the judgment below.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment below terminating appellant's parental rights and granting adoption on the grounds that even though appellant's efforts to visit or contact her child were few and far between, her conduct was insufficient to constitute abandonment. The parent-child relationship was not destroyed, and she had not relinquished parental claims. Termination of parental rights was not justified under statutory and case law.</SPAN></P>

COURT FROM WHICH APPEALED: LINCOLN COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT. TRIAL COURT DISPOSITION: GUILTY OF SEVEN COUNTS OF DEFRAUDING STATE GOVERNMENT AND FIVE COUNTS OF UTTERING FORGERY - THREE YEARS EACH COUNT TO RUN CONSECUTIVELY WITH COUNTS 8-12 RUNNING CONCURRENT TO COUNTS 1-7.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment on a jury verdict in the Lincoln County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which convicted him of defrauding the state government and of uttering forgery. Defendant asserted the jury was prejudiced, that the trial judge failed to suppress evidence and improperly allowed certain testimony and evidence, that the trial judge failed to demur to the indictment due to duplicity, and failed to dismiss multiplicitous counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction of defrauding the government and of uttering forgery in his business of rebuilding cars was reversed and remanded. The trial judge improperly allowed highway patrol investigators to explain various portions of Mississippi law to the jury outside of their respective areas of expertise. All evidence obtained without consent to search and under a general search warrant should have been suppressed. Insufficient notice of a handwriting expert to be used by the state did not allow defendant time to have an expert review the report and examine the same documents. Because character was not an element of the charges of a separate indictment against defendant, the presence of stolen property at defendant's business and the testimony of local body shop owners as to forgery were not relevant or admissible under Miss. R. Evid. 404(b) and 405. Insurance files were not properly authenticated and an investigator's lack of expertise in repairing vehicles made that testimony improper. The trial judge correctly ruled that the indictment was neither duplicitous or multiplicitous but the prosecutor's improper remarks during closing arguments were grounds for a mistrial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was reversed and remanded because the trial court erred in allowing witnesses to instruct the jury as to the law, in failing to suppress evidence obtained by illegal search and seizure, in allowing evidence of uncharged crimes, and in failing to declare a mistrial due to prosecutorial misconduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pro se plaintiff sought review of a decision of the Pontotoc County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which granted summary judgment in a garbage collection fee dispute to defendant local government agencies and officials, denied plaintiff's motion for a default judgment, and dismissed his amended complaint against defendant Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a garbage collection fee dispute, pro se plaintiff asserted that defendant government agencies' and officials' motions for summary judgment and dismissal were of no effect because they were submitted by an attorney not listed on the entry of appearance form. The court found that the employment of a firm of lawyers was equivalent to the retainer of each member of the firm. Ex parte communications by defendants' attorneys with the trial judge's office fell within the rubric of scheduling or administrative purposes. Local government agencies that administered solid waste disposal were authorized by statute and officials of the agencies were properly sworn in. The Attorney General was authorized to provide written opinions to state and local governments and officials, who were entitled to rely on such opinions, and plaintiff had abandoned his claim that there should have been a hearing on the opinion holding that he had to pay garbage pick-up fees. Plaintiff did not have standing to challenge contracts entered into by defendants and there was no separation of power problem with an official's dual appointments. The trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grant of summary judgment to defendant government agencies and officials, the dismissal of plaintiff's amended complaint, and the denial of plaintiff's motion for a default judgment was affirmed because there was no merit in plaintiff's points of error, plaintiff abandoned his claim to a hearing on the Attorney General's opinion that he had to pay garbage fees, and plaintiff had no standing to challenge the contracts defendants entered into.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a prison inmate, sought to be credited with executive time for work he performed during a winter storm. Although he did not go outside the prison, as did some inmates during the storm, he claimed that an executive order of the governor, granting such executive time, applied to all inmates. The appellate court held that the executive time was based upon the recommendation of the commissioner of the department of corrections (commissioner), who did not recommend appellant for executive time because inmates who performed normal work duties during the ice storm were not eligible. The commissioner's power to recommend to the governor that appellant receive executive time was discretionary and no state court may infringe upon the governor's power to pardon or to commute sentences.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Arguing that his right to a speedy trial had been violated, appellant sought review of a judgment of the Jasper County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which convicted him for using profane and indecent language over the telephone and sentenced him as a habitual offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested on three counts of making an obscene phone call in June 1993. He was indicted by a grand jury in August 1993, but a judgment of continuance was entered in April 1994. The criminal action was later dropped in September 1996 after appellant was indicted a second time for the same violations in February 1995. Appellant was tried, convicted on all counts, and sentenced as a habitual offender. His motions for a new trial and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict were denied. Appellant sought review, arguing that the trial court erred in refusing to dismiss the case due to the failure of the State to prosecute within 270 days of arraignment. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that due to motions by defendant, including a motion for continuance, and psychiatric examinations that tolled the time, a period of only 203 days passed without appellant being tried for the crime he was charged with committing. The court concluded that appellant had no available statutory relief from his conviction under Miss.

The court held the appellee did not improperly use peremptory challenges to eliminate black jurors. Where black juror did not respond to questions and did not have an employment history, appellee properly exercised a peremptory challenge, based on a race neutral reason, to eliminate the potential juror. The court held it was not error to refuse appellant's motion for a continuance based upon the purportedly prejudicial impact of a news story. Trial court judge determined only one juror had heard the news story and appellant chose not to exercise a remaining peremptory challenge against that juror. The court held appellant was not denied effective assistance of counsel. Appellant failed to produce one example demonstrating his counsel's performance was deficient.</SPAN></P>

The court denied his post-trial motions. He appealed. The court affirmed as he failed to prove his claims or they were otherwise without merit. The court did not err in stacking sentences considering defendant was allegedly elderly and sick. Appellant failed to place his age in the record, and he was sentenced well within the guidelines. He failed to supply the court with case law that would require reversal of his case because the record was lost. Because the amount of evidence against appellant was overwhelming, an erroneous statement by a narcotics officer was harmless. The trial court did not err in denying a continuance or in not assisting in securing two defense witnesses because they had nothing to do with appellant's arrest, and the proffer that was made was not germane to the central issue of whether he possessed cocaine with intent to sell. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a new trial as the evidence supported the jury's decision.</SPAN></P>

The easement benefitted a tract then owned by appellee. Appellee sued arguing that an easement should be declared across all of the land.

The trial court found that appellee would be irreparably damaged unless a temporary recognition of rights under an easement was entered. The trial court found that the failure to provide for access to that tract resulted in an easement by necessity. From that judgment appellant perfected an appeal. In the meantime, each party sold its parcel to the same individual, recombining the two tracts into one common tract. The court concluded that the easement was extinguished and that the controversy was moot, with the exception of attorney's fees for defending against appellee's motion for a preliminary injunction. The court concluded that the easement was released when appellant released the tract from his deed of trust and therefore appellant had no rights in the easement even after foreclosing and that the granting of a preliminary injunction was not wrongful.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed the judgment of the trial court, which dismissed defendant's motion. The appellate court vacated the guilty plea and remanded for trial after finding that the plea was made involuntarily. The trial court erred in failing to find a factual basis for defendant's plea and in failing to inform defendant of the elements of and the minimum sentences for manslaughter. The record revealed that the trial court did not inquire of defendant regarding the factual circumstances surrounding his guilty plea. The trial court only inquired whether defendant committed the crime, to which defendant responded positively. Further, the precise elements of manslaughter applicable to defendant's action, as stated in Miss Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 97-3-17(b), 97-3-29, and 97-7-31, were not discussed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a young child died while in appellant's care, appellant was arrested, indicted, and convicted of capital murder resulting from child abuse.

The court determined that there was not substantial and irreparable prejudice to appellant's case because other expert witnesses testified on the same issue. The court found that under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-19(2)(f), capital murder could be committed with our without deliberate design; thus, the indictment was proper when it failed to include a specific intent provision. Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-5-39, which defined the crime of felonious abuse or battery of a child, was not unconstitutionally vague because it clearly stated the elements of the crime and provided a sufficiently definite warning of what was unlawful conduct. The trial court did not err in denying appellant's requested instructions, for the jury had been adequately instructed on the elements of the offense in other instructions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the basis of an undercover buy made by a paid informant, defendant was convicted under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-139 of unlawful sale of cocaine and was sentenced to 30 years and fined. The court affirmed, finding that none of defendant's purported errors was such as to deny him a fundamentally fair trial. First, the trial court properly refused to allow cross-examination of the informant as to his associates. By permitting questions as to only the basic facts and not the identities of those with whom the informant conducted the transactions, the trial judge avoided diversion into collateral matters. Second, it was proper to admit an enhanced version of a tape recording made during the sale because the informant confirmed that it reflected an accurate recording of the conversation between himself and defendant, and the tape had not been significantly altered. Third, there was substantial evidence of such quality and weight that reasonable jurors in the exercise of impartial judgment could have found defendant guilty. The court perceived no injustice in the submission of the case to the jurors and thus left their resulting determination of guilt undisturbed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Pike County Circuit Court (Mississippi) entered a final judgment of conviction after it accepted defendant's plea of nolo contendre to a third-offense operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor (DUI). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was driving his vehicle and approached an intersection. He slowed his vehicle when he saw a roadblock and made a left turn on to a street. A police officer was intercepting vehicles trying to evade the roadblock. As defendant made the turn, the officer signaled defendant to pull over to determine why defendant avoided the roadblock. The officer observed defendant was intoxicated. The officer also saw an empty whiskey bottle on defendant's floorboard. Defendant was arrested and charged with felony DUI in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 63-11-30(2)(c), which required three convictions for a DUI offense to be a felony. After defendant pled nolo contendre and was sentenced, the appellate court found the officer had the reasonable suspicion necessary to stop defendant's vehicle when he saw defendant tried to evade the roadblock and had probable cause to arrest defendant when he observed defendant had been drinking. It further found defendant's ex post facto rights were not violated even though his first DUI conviction required more subsequent DUI convictions for a felony as the statute, in effect before defendant's latest crime, merely stiffened the penalty for DUI.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A lessee appealed from a decision of the Grenada County Chancery Court (Mississippi) that declared that no renewal of a 1957 lease granted by the appellee city had ever been properly authorized and that the lessee had no rights to the land. City cross-appealed asserting that the chancellor improperly denied its timely amendment to add a claim for damages to the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court properly found there was no new lease on city property where no new lease could be found, there was no proof in city council minutes of a renewal being discussed or approved; and the alleged proof of notice and acceptance of the lease could not be produced. There was no evidence that any city official had the authority to negotiate, agree to terms, and enter an agreement to lease real property. There was no hint that the lessee made efforts to assure the validity of a renewal. There was no manifest error in the chancellor's failing to find estoppel arising from 14-year-old improvements. As the city manager had no authority to renew the lease, and with no agreement as to new terms, there was no possible justifiable reliance on such action. No equitable grounds existed to override the absence of city council approval of a lease renewal. The lessee was a tenant at will, obligated to pay rent payments until ousted. There was no abuse of discretion in denying leave to amend two-and-a-half years after a declaratory judgment action was filed by the city where the alleged late discovery of the facts underlying the amendment was implausible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court did not err entering judgment for appellee. An attorney general's opinion appellant wanted to introduce was a nullity when the actions at issue were taken by the tax collector. It had no relevance to this issue. The lower court properly excluded the opinion under Miss. R. Evid. 401, 402. The subsequent efforts, reasons for, and results of the tax commission's efforts to change the collection of ad valorem taxes on trucks held and were not relevant to the issue of ad valorem taxes owed by the companies. The chancellor also properly excluded this evidence. The trucks were dispatched from and returned to the county every day. The trial court properly held that the county was the domicile of these vehicles. The chancellor's actions were supported by substantial evidence and were not manifestly in error. The companies failed to prove any tax amnesty and its application to its operations. The county's tax rate was fairly apportioned and did not discriminate against interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to, and was convicted of, one count of sexual battery in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-95 (1972). Defendant was sentenced to a term of 25 years. Defendant appealed the decision of the Pearl River County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which denied his motion for post conviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that (1) his indictment was improperly amended, (2) the amended indictment placed him in double jeopardy, (3) the trial court lacked jurisdiction, (4) he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel, (5) unobjected to issues were not procedurally barred, (6) his plea bargain was a contract and he suffered prejudice in sentencing, and (7) the sexual battery statute was ambiguous. The appellate court concluded that defendant failed to prove his claims. Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-95 was unambiguous. The amended indictment did not alter the essential nature of the charge since both penetration and lack of consent still had to be proven. The point of penetration was not a substantive change in the indictment. There was no material alteration of a defense available to defendant. Defendant understood the amendment process and consented to it. Also, although both sides performed their promises in the plea bargain, defendant who was unsatisfied with the length of his sentence wanted a better deal. Defendant failed to cite authority for several of his arguments, which precluded appellate review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant sought review of an order from the Jackson County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which granted the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Miss. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), of appellees, county sheriff's department, and officers in the sheriff's office, individually and in their official capacity. The claimant maintained that statutory immunity did not apply to the claimant's suit for alleged mistreatment in custody.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was arrested and detained overnight for public drunkenness. The prosecution was unsuccessful and the claimant filed suit against the county sheriff's department and the officers that participated in the claimant's arrest. The claimant alleged that the officers placed the claimant in a choke hold and sprayed the claimant with pepper spray without reason. The claimant sued the officers in both the officers' individual and official capacity. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted of the county sheriff's department and the officers based in part on the grounds of statutory immunity. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part. The court held that: (1) Miss Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-9(1) exempted the county sheriff's department and the officers sued in the officers' official capacity from liability; and (2) the trial court's dismissal of the claimant's suit against the officers in the officers' individual capacity was premature pursuant to the waiver of immunity in Miss Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-5.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed the judgment of the Panola County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which in a joint trial convicted one defendant of rape of a child under 14 years and sentenced him to life in prison, convicted a second defendant of accessory before the fact to capital rape and sentenced him to eight years in prison, and convicted the third defendant as an accessory after the fact and sentenced her to five years in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One defendant stood inside the door of the bedroom where defendant female's three daughters were sleeping while the other male defendant raped the 13-year-old. Defendant female observed the attack and retreated. Following the ordeal, she escorted the victim to the bathroom, where she washed the semen from her daughter's body and bedclothes. Her only comment to the children was that they should have locked the door. Defendants jointly and individually urged eight grounds for reversal. The court affirmed the convictions, but reversed the eight-year sentence for accessory before the fact to capital rape and remanded that defendant for resentencing because: (1) he was an aider and abettor and was subject to the same punishment as a principal, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-1-3 (Rev. 1994); (2) Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-65(1) required the trial court to impose either a life term or the death penalty; and (3) defendant's claim that a life sentence would be cruel and unusual punishment in his case was without merit. The court held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in finding that defendants' race-neutral explanations for their peremptory challenges to white jurors were pretexts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendants' convictions and sentences, with the exception of the eight-year sentence. The court vacated the eight-year sentence and remanded for resentencing in accordance with the mandatory sentencing provisions of the state code, which provided that an adult convicted of raping a child younger than 14 had to be sentenced to death or life in prison.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed his conviction and sentence and found that the circuit court did not err in admitting defendant's statement to the arresting officer that the contraband belonged to him, despite irregularities in his Miranda warning, because he was not in custody when he made the voluntary statement. The court rejected defendant's argument that the jury was not properly instructed as to the difference between &quot;all reasonable doubt&quot; and &quot;a reasonable doubt&quot; and found no error in the instructions as a whole that would have prejudiced his right to a fair trial. An attempt by the circuit court to reduce defendant's enhanced sentence after he had filed his appeal was invalid because the filing of the appeal deprived the circuit court of jurisdiction to modify the sentence. The court ruled that defendant's right to a speedy trial was not violated because he did not assert the claim until after his trial and he failed to show that the trial delay prejudiced him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving his vehicle in excess of the posted speed limit in a city court. Defendant appealed to the Winston County Circuit Court (Mississippi) where the case was tried de novo as a bench trial. Defendant was once again found guilty. Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for speeding on a state highway that was within the municipality's borders. The court held that under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 63-3-519 (1996) a state highway running through the municipality was a &quot;public street&quot; and, through the city's broad police power, the city had jurisdiction over the state road. The court held that the use of radar equipment to bag speeders was proper under &sect; 63-3-519. Further, the court found that defendant's citation failed to conclude with the words &quot;against the peace and dignity of the State of Mississippi.&quot; The court found that failure to use the words was unconstitutional pursuant to Miss. Const. art. VI, &sect;169 (1890) when a defendant violated a state law. In affirming, however, the court held that defendant was charged with violating a municipal ordinance that governed a city's speed limit on city streets and the violation did not invoke &sect; 169 of the Mississippi Constitution. The court found defendant failed to raise the driver identification issue at trial so it was waived on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that found defendant guilty of driving his vehicle in excess of the posted speed limit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of a drug related offense. Defendant had been convicted of such offenses in the past, and his sentence was adjusted accordingly pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-147n (Rev. 1993) and Miss Code Ann. (Rev. 1994). Defendant appealed. The court found that the trial judge was within the statutory guidelines when defendant's sentence was determined. The court found that the double enhancement of the sentence was constitutional because it was proportional to the crime committed. The court determined that denial of defendant's motions for directed verdict and a new trial were not improper because the sufficiency and weight of the evidence were ample enough to support a conviction. The court found that amendment of the indictment to charge defendant as an habitual offender was not improper. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association challenged the zoning regulation on the ground that it amounted to a taking. On appeal, the court affirmed the adoption of the zoning regulations but remanded the takings issue for determination by the trial court. The court rejected the association's argument that the Board was required to give advance public notice that the Zoning Commission would be established at their March 11, 1994. The court also found that although the Commission's action were not in strict adherence to the requirements of the Open Meetings Act, its actions were in substantial compliance and thus not erroneous. The court also rejected the association's argument that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 61-7-7 (1) required the Board to identify a particular airport hazard or hazards in the minutes of its meetings in order to have authority to adopt the airport zoning ordinance. Yet, the court ruled that by ordering the Board to conduct evidentiary hearings with respect to each parcel of land affected by the ordinance, it was in effect forcing the Board to gather evidence for the association's takings claim, when the Board was under no legal obligation to conduct such fact-finding endeavors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the part of the judgment directing the Board to refrain from enforcing the airport zoning ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a friend were both indicted for capital murder in the beating death of the victim. The friend pled to a lesser charge and testified at defendant's trial. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's five assignments of error and affirmed the judgment. The jury's verdict was not against the weight of the evidence, which was sufficient to satisfy all elements of manslaughter. The court determined that the task of interpreting whether defendant's fist could have been considered a dangerous weapon, as that phrase was employed by Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-35 (Rev. 1994), was a factual determination for the jury. The court held that the trial court did not err in its instructions to the jury or in its evidentiary rulings. The court also ruled that defendant failed to establish that venue was improper. The sheriff's testimony regarding the location of the body raised a presumption as to the location of the killing and was sufficient to undergird the trial court's finding that venue was proper.</SPAN></P>
