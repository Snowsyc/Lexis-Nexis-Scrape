</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment that defendants, real estate sellers, violated Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 11010, 11018.1, 11022, and 11023, which were part of the Subdivided Lands Act, by failing to file a notice of intention to subdivide and sell parcels of land, offering parcels for sale without providing a public report, and engaging in false and misleading advertising concerning the land. The court rejected defendants' constitutional challenge to the law and held that regulation of subdivision of lands did not deprive them of any fundamental liberty, but was instead a limited economic regulation of real property for the public's protection. The court found that defendants' conviction was supported by the evidence because it established their participation in a series of unlawful transactions, which was sufficient to show that they aided and abetted illegal conduct. The court rejected defendants' arguments that the lower court subjected them to double jeopardy when it dismissed the deadlocked trial jury. The court held that the record showed that the jury was at a stalemate and that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, former wife, challenged a substantive decision of the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California) that held that the provisions of Cal.

Plaintiff also challenged the decision of the superior court to not hear any further matters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, former wife, was married to a public employee who was a member of the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS). The employee designated plaintiff as his beneficiary under PERS. They divorced, then he re-married and later died without changing his beneficiary. Before he died, the legislature had passed Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 21205, which provided that dissolution of marriage constituted an automatic revocation of an employee's previous revocable designation of beneficiary under PERS. His wife at the time of his death received compensation under PERS because she was considered the statutory beneficiary. Plaintiff made a claim for benefits but the claim was denied. In affirming the decision of the superior court, the court held that &sect; 21205 was not unconstitutional because the legislative changes were materially related to the theory of a pension system and its successful operation. The members of PERS received advantages as well as disadvantages. The court also affirmed the decision of the superior court not to hear any other matters than the constitutionality of &sect; 21205.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a committee of residents, appealed from the Superior Court of Fresno County (California), which found that an environmental impact report adequately supported the decision of defendants, university and college trustees, to approve and authorize construction of an athletic stadium.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, university and college trustees, approved and authorized the construction of an athletic stadium located in the northwest area of the campus. Their decision was supported by an en environmental impact report (EIR). At the time of acquisition, the proposed site was surrounded largely by open agricultural land. When the EIR was prepared, the surrounding area was developed residentially with single family homes, apartments, sorority and fraternity houses, and the university campus. Plaintiffs, a committee of residents, filed suit seeking to invalidate the EIR as a post hoc rationalization of the project, to enjoin solicitation of building funds for the stadium, and to determine that the scope of judicial review as provided in Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect; 21168, was unconstitutional. From an adverse judgment, plaintiffs appealed, contending that &sect;&sect; 21168 and 21168.5 violated equal protection, that the trustees' determination was invalid, the EIR was inadequate and invalid, and that they were entitled to attorney fees. After review, the court concluded that all of plaintiffs' contentions were without merit. Thus, the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded to the trial court to issue a writ of administrative mandate ordering respondent to award appellant service-connected disability benefits on the basis of a heart disease arising out of and in the course of his employment. The court held that it was error for the board to base its decision on the testimony of one doctor because it did not rebut the presumption of Cal.

Petitioner argued that he was entitled to credit for the time he was in prison between being arraigned on the subsequent charges, and the time sentence was imposed. The court denied the writ of habeas corpus sought, finding that the purpose of &sect; 2900.5 was to prevent inequality to impoverished defendants who could not make bail and were required to remain in custody during the proceedings. The court found that petitioner's status as a state prisoner was not due to the subsequent charges, but the prior prison commitment, and the credit provisions of &sect; 2900.5 should not apply to petitioner's situation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted appellant of first-degree murder under the felony-murder rule, and first-degree robbery. The trial judge modified the murder verdict to second-degree murder. The court reversed and ordered the first-degree murder verdict reinstated. The trial judge amended the judgment as directed; appellant now appeals from that action of the trial court. Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1181(6) provided that when the verdict or finding was contrary to law or evidence, but if the evidence showed the defendant to be not guilty of the degree of the crime of which he was convicted, but guilty of a lesser degree thereof, or of a lesser crime included, the court could modify the verdict without granting or ordering a new trial. This power extended to any court to which the cause may be appealed. Appellant's conviction as originally modified by the trial judge was reinstated because the statutory scheme discriminated impermissibly between similarly situated persons in that it allowed the People to appeal an order reducing a conviction to a lesser degree of the same offense but did not allow an appeal of an order reducing a conviction to a lesser-included offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged with brandishing a deadly weapon. He pled not guilty by reason of insanity and he was thereafter found mentally incompetent to stand trial. Criminal proceedings were suspended and he was committed to a state hospital. Petitioner filed a writ of habeas corpus after he had been confined for six months. The prosecution resisted. The due process clauses, federal and state, were the most basic substantive checks on government's power to act unfairly or oppressively. As such, they protected against infringements by the state upon those fundamental rights implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. Due process forbade the arbitrary deprivation of liberty and, in the context of commitment to a mental hospital required at least that the nature and duration of commitment bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual was committed. However, in the case of the incompetent defendant, the state might have a legitimate interest in obtaining a conviction, an interest not present in the case of either mentally disordered sex offenders or those found not guilty by reason of insanity. The petition was denied, as petitioner had been released.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition for a writ of habeas corpus was denied because petitioner had already been released from confinement in the state mental hospital. The case was literally moot.</SPAN></P>

The complaint alleged that the airport was a public nuisance per se because it was being operated without a special use permit in violation of a zoning ordinance. The trial court entered a pretrial order enjoining appellant from operating the airport. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that it was not clear that the permit requirements of the ordinance applied to appellant's airport. Further, the court noted, that although the trial court stated in its decision granting the preliminary injunction that it had balanced the equities, it did not weigh the relative harm to the parties where it did not consider the possibility of interlocutory judicial error in its holding that the airport operation constituted a zoning violation. Even though there was a strong governmental interest in enforcing the zoning ordinance, appellant had made a strong showing of interim harm if the injunction should issue. Accordingly, the court held, the failure to balance this harm against the governmental interest in securing compliance with the ordinance was an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Fiscal year 1960 to 1961 salary ordinances provided that authorized overtime could be compensated for only by compensatory time off.

Plaintiffs, retired deputy sheriff and active duty deputy sheriffs, worked for defendant county. Plaintiff retired deputy sheriff was promised compensation when he retired. Plaintiff retired deputy sheriff sought the monetary value of his accrued overtime and the remaining plaintiff sought a declaration that they were entitled to receive compensatory time off or the monetary equivalent thereof. The trial court sustained defendant's demurrers without leave to amend. Plaintiffs appealed. Defendant could be bound by equitable estoppel if plaintiffs were induced to refrain from taking compensatory time off or compensation. The court found no harmful effect on a public policy that would result from invoking estoppel. The court reversed because plaintiffs clearly sought a declaration of the effect of specified salary ordinances and there was no necessity that each plaintiff plead precisely the number of overtime hours accrued.</SPAN></P>

Appellants argued that Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 330a, 330b(1), 330b(2), and 330.1 were unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, lessors of blackjack machines, challenged a decision denying a preliminary injunction to prohibit respondent, city and county, from confiscating video machines, and from arresting persons who manufactured, owned, or leased the machines. Respondent argued that the trial court could not properly enjoin the enforcement of pertinent statutes. Appellants argued that Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 330a, 330b(1), 330b(2), and 330.1 were unconstitutionally vague. Appellants contended their machines rewarded the winning player only with an additional chance to play the machine without cost. The court held that &sect;&sect; 330b(1), 330b(2), and 330.1 explicitly stated that their prohibitions applied when the user of a machine, as a result of any element of hazard or chance, became entitled to receive anything of value or additional chance or right to use such machine or device, or to receive any token, whether of value or otherwise, entitling the holder to receive anything of value. Therefore, the statutes included within their prohibitions a machine that afforded the winner only the additional right to use that machine. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. The court concluded that the slot machine statutes were constitutional as applied to appellant lessors' device and their device, if found to be a game of chance, was prohibited by the terms of those statutes, because the reward of free games constituted a thing of value within the meaning of the statutes. The trial court therefore properly denied their request for a preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lessee appealed a decision in an unlawful detainer action between a petroleum distributor and a retail gasoline franchisee. Plaintiff lessor filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which the court granted. Plaintiff argued that the factual issue of good cause to terminate the lease was immaterial because Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 20999.1, which prohibited termination without good cause, was enacted subsequent to the leasehold and thus could not be constitutionally applied. Defendant argued that no impairment of contract occurred because the lease terminated automatically and was thereafter renewed on a month-to-month basis subsequent to the statute's effective date. On appeal, the court reversed. Although generally a statute could not be applied retroactively to impair an existing contractual obligation, U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 10; Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 9, a month-to-month holdover was a new arrangement, not a continuation of the original lease. When the parties agreed upon the new arrangement, all law then applicable, including Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 20999, 20999.1, became a part of agreement.</SPAN></P>

The pleadings disclosed the possibility of an affirmative defense; it was error to grant judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee was a recipient of Aid to Families with Dependant Children (AFDC) under a program provided by her employer, the Department of Public Social Services. Appellant was dismissed from her employment based upon an allegation that she had accepted overpayments as a recipient of funds from the DPSS under the AFDC program. The court denied appellant's motion for a preliminary injunction prohibiting respondent Los Angeles County Civil Service Commission from admitting her records as a client from DPSS at her hearing challenging her dismissal from employment. Appellant sought review and contended that her records as a client of DPSS were confidential under Cal. Welf. &amp; Instit. Code &sect; 10850. On appeal, the lower court judgment was affirmed. In support of its ruling, the court held that appellant's situation fell within an exception to the protections accorded by &sect; 10850 as her circumstances directly connected with the administration of the AFDC program. The court also found that application of the exception in &sect; 10850 to appellant as eligibility worker-recipient did not violate her right of equal protection under either the United States or California Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court judgment, which denied appellant employee's request to prohibit admission of her records as a client of AFDC program offered by her employer, County Department of Public Social Services, from the hearing challenging appellant's dismissal from employment, was affirmed. Appellant's records were not subject to statutory confidentiality protections because her employment was directly connected with administration of the AFDC program.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction, and held that the inconsistencies in witnesses' testimony were not severe and were mostly the result of differences in the chronology of events and the relative position of the participants, and because the incident occurred rather suddenly at a fairly well attended party. The court affirmed the lack of circumstantial evidence instruction because the direct evidence was not so fraught with inconsistencies that it could not have been considered direct evidence. As to sentencing, the court affirmed and held that appellant was not entitled to notice of the grounds upon which the court intended to rely in ordering the upper term of incarceration because appellant had been supplied with the probation officer's report, and any other reports and statements in aggravation or mitigation upon which the court relied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, detainee and visitors, filed individual and class action complaints against jail officials, real parties in interest, challenging the legality of a covert electronic surveillance system that monitored conversations between detainees and their visitors. Petitioners challenged the decision of respondent court, which upheld the real parties' demurrer, and alleged the electronic surveillance system was in derogation of their rights under both the federal and state constitutions. The court overruled the trial court's granting of the demurrer, and held that the conduct was constitutionally impermissible under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, because there was not a compelling governmental interest that justified the systematic surveillance operation. The court ruled that there was no compelling need to engage in such wholesale, indiscriminate intrusion into the area of a detainees' private conversation, particularly in the visiting room, therefore the conduct could not survive judicial scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed a request for a writ of habeas corpus demanding credit for time served in state prison, following his return there as an escaped prisoner, against a sentence imposed for charges brought after petitioner's apprehension that arose out of conduct related to his escape. Petitioner asserted that he was entitled to credit under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 2900.5 and that denying him credit was an equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioner's request for a writ of habeas corpus, but allowed him credit for time served in state prison following his return there as an escaped prisoner. Petitioner was serving a prison term for robbery when he escaped. Petitioner was captured in possession of a firearm and heroin. Petitioner was returned to state prison and charges were filed against him in the county court, but were dismissed when charges were filed in municipal court. As part of a plea bargain, the escape charge was dismissed and petitioner pleaded guilty to the drug and weapons charges. The court stated that, in its opinion, petitioner was not entitled to credit for the time served prior to the entry of his plea pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 2900.5. The court reasoned that the original robbery conviction was the reason for petitioner's incarceration in state prison, not the pending charges. However, the court conceded that it was obligated to follow precedent that held that petitioner would be entitled to credit. The court denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus because petitioner was not eligible for immediate release, but ordered that the credit be given.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and stated that there was no equal protection violation and that petitioner was not entitled to credit when his incarceration was the result of prior charges. However, the court was obligated to follow precedent that reached the opposite conclusion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, Caucasian firefighters and the city, appealed a decision of the Superior Court of Alameda County (California) that granted affirmative relief to plaintiffs, black citizens and firefighters, by imposing a quota for the hiring of minority firefighters and held that the fire department's written examinations, physical standards and tests, and seniority weighting were invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a group of black citizens and firefighters, brought a class action against defendant city and contended that the percentage of minorities employed by the fire department bore no reasonable relationship to their percentage in the population and that the fire department's examinations and standards did not substantially relate to the performance of the job. Plaintiffs sought a writ of mandate calculated to dissipate the effect of the fire department's history of discrimination. Caucasians who were fire fighters or who aspired to hold such jobs joined with defendant city as intervenors in defense of plaintiffs' action and contended that their employment or promotion chances would be lost or jeopardized by the affirmative relief sought by plaintiffs. After the trial court granted affirmative relief in the form of a hiring quota for minority applicants, defendant and intervenors appealed. The court held that those entitled to relief under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were the individual victims of racial discrimination and not members generally of the race discriminated against and that a quota was a form of racial discrimination. The court therefore reversed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

Employee settled her claim against appellant and executed a general release. The court held that subrogation judgment must be reversed when trial court proceeded under the mistaken impression that liability was conclusively determined by respondent's administrative decision to bring the suit. The court remanded for a new trial, clarifying that appellant could contest liability. The court rejected appellant's arguments that the statute providing for subrogation actions, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 31820, violated equal protection or due process. The court held that the appropriate statute of limitations for such subrogation actions was the one-year limit of Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 340(3), not the three-year limit applied to statutory actions, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 338(1).

The court limited its determination as to whether substantial evidence existed to support the severance. The court found substantial evidence existed to establish appellant was incapable of providing proper support and control over her children. The report from an investigation was properly admitted into evidence because appellant was given a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine and controvert the content of the report.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff resident alleged he was permanently disabled as a consequence of a swine flu immunization he received from defendant county. Defendant responded with a general demurrer asserting total immunity under the provisions of Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 856.6. The trial court granted immunity and plaintiff appealed, asserting that &sect; 856.6 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 856.6 was constitutional because it related to and acted uniformly upon the whole of any single class of individuals and the classification was founded upon some natural, intrinsic or constitutional distinction. The court further found that plaintiff lacked standing to claim that &sect; 856.6 fostered economic discrimination because plaintiff's complaint failed to allege inability on his part to obtain inoculation from a private physician and the need to be inoculated through publicly funded clinics. Lastly, the court found that the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, did not require &sect; 856.6 to yield to the federal statute,&nbsp;42 U.S.C.S. &sect;247b, because the federal statute expressly set forth the exclusive nature of a claimant's remedy for injury under the National Swine Flu Immunization Program.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner hospitals contended that respondent Workers' Compensation Insurance Board had improperly reduced the amounts of its liens against the settlements of respondent workers.

The court found that the statute was not applied retroactively because petitioners' rights in the liens vested after the statute's effective date at the time of settlement. The court ruled that the statute was not vague but that respondent workers had not complied with due process requirements because petitioners were not served with sufficient documentary evidence supporting the basis for the reductions. The court held that the reduction of the claim where the cause of a respondent worker's injury was not at issue denied petitioners equal protection of the laws because the employer was required to pay the full value of the services provided.

Appellants petitioned respondent municipal court for a writ of prohibition. Respondent denied their petitions. On appeal, the court granted appellants' petitions and reversed and remanded respondent's order, finding that &sect; 650 was unconstitutional because it was overbroad, vague, and denied equal protection of the laws. The statute was overbroad on its face because it flatly prohibited anonymity under circumstances where protected activities were involved, and because the restriction was not required by a compelling state interest nor was it implemented in the least restrictive manner possible.

Code &sect; 40000.28, he had a statutory right to a jury trial. The court reversed and remanded. The court held that permitting appellant to elevate the charge to a misdemeanor did not unconstitutionally subject respondent's exclusive responsibility for criminal prosecution to a private citizen, Cal. Const. art. V, &sect; 13, and that other statutes provided a defendant the right to increase the seriousness of the charge, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 17(b). The court held that the municipal court's decision to strike the prior in the third case without having provided its reasons required reversal, because the municipal court could not deprive appellant of his right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

Gov't Code &sect; 69898 (c), (d) was unconstitutional in light of Cal. Const. art. VI, &sect; 4, which made a county clerk also the superior court clerk, ex officio. The court held Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 69898 was constitutional because it did not diminish or destroy the constitutional office of superior court clerk. However, the court also held that the challenged court rule exceeded the authority granted by the statute because it purported to transfer to the superior court executive officer all of the powers and duties exercised by the county clerk in connection with judicial matters; not in his capacity as county clerk as the statute specified, but in his capacity as clerk of the superior court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a California corporation, published a weekly advertising newspaper. Defendant, a California corporation and various individuals, began distribution of a similar advertising newspaper in the communities where plaintiff distributed its paper, offering, without charge, display ad space and also selling such space below actual cost.

The trial court awarded plaintiff the relief it sought, except that it denied statutory treble damages because it found that defendants' acts were not malicious. In this case of first impression, the court held that the trial court erred in refusing to award treble damages. The court held that because plaintiff had proved actual damages under the California Unfair Practices Act, it was entitled to mandatory treble damages pursuant to Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 17082. Analogizing from the federal Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect; 13, which provided for mandatory treble damages, the court held that the issue of whether defendant acted maliciously was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

While &sect; 526(a) allowed appellants to challenge wasteful expenditure of county funds by respondents, the court found that the unequal assessment practices of respondents were not waste within the meaning of &sect; 526(a). Appellant's relief was for mandamus that required respondents to assess the property in accordance with Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 1, and Cal Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect;401, et seq. Thus, the court reversed with directions to sustain respondents' demurrer with leave for appellant to amend its complaint to allege that the manner of assessing property in the county violated the statutory mandate that all property be assessed at a specified percentage of its fair market or full value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the demurrer of respondents, County of Monterey and Monterey County tax assessor, because unequal assessment practices were not waste. The court held that appellant nonprofit taxpayer corporation should have been allowed to amend its complaint seeking mandamus requiring respondents to assess property in accordance to statutory mandates requiring that all property be assessed at the same percentage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile was declared a ward of the juvenile court pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 602, after he was found to have committed a burglary. Defendant was committed to the California Youth Authority (CYA) for the maximum term of confinement permitted by law. Defendant appealed and contended that the statutory scheme of Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect;&sect; 726, 731, was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for a new dispositional hearing. The court held the provision within &sect; 726 relating to the automatic imposition of the upper term of confinement violated the Equal protection clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 7(a), because it treated similarly situated juveniles differently than adults for whom no automatic imposition was required. The court held that juvenile courts would now have to apply the substantive rule of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170(d), which provided for the sentencing of the middle term unless aggravating or mitigating circumstances were established. The court also held the trial court erred in failing to give defendant credit for time spent in custody pending juvenile court proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court held the legislation authorizing judicial proceedings by the board was constitutional.

Respondent state demurred citing sovereign immunity and respondent corporation demurred claiming the statute of limitations had run on the action. The lower court sustained respondents' demurrers and dismissed appellant's actions. On appeal, the court reversed in part because sovereign immunity was inapplicable as an injury was caused by a dangerous condition of the government's property and appellant could join respondent state as a tortfeasor and if necessary obtain partial indemnity by cross-complaint. The court affirmed in part, finding the statute of limitations in Cal. Civ. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was brought to trial on the basis that he violated Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11355 when he offered to sell and deliver a controlled substance to an undercover officer. Defendant was arrested prior to the delivery and he did not possess a controlled substance as stipulated. Defendant sought an acquittal based on the absence of evidence of an actual transfer of a non-controlled substance between defendant and the officer, which the lower court denied and instructed the jury that an offer to sell a controlled substance followed by an offer to deliver a non-controlled substance was a crime. On appeal, the court held that despite the plain meaning of the statute, it was not sufficient to merely offer to make a delivery of a substitute and that the statute's historical application required an overt, direct and unequivocal activity directed toward a physical transfer of a specific and identified substance. As the lower court's instructions permitted a guilty verdict even when the delivery requirement was not proved, the court found that an essential element of the crime was omitted from the instructions and reversed the lower court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that California's governmental interest was to protect the innkeeper within its territorial jurisdiction against unlimited liability and that it had no interest in limiting the liability of a hotel outside its territorial limits.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant newspaper publisher received a judgment that established his newspaper as one of general circulation in and around respondent city. Thereafter, the trial court granted respondent's motion to vacate that judgment. Review was sought by appellant. The court held that the motion to vacate was properly granted. The court stated that appellant's paper could not qualify as one of general circulation under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 6000 because it was not published within the boundaries of respondent. The court rejected appellant's contention that Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 6008 was unconstitutional because the term &quot;substantial&quot; was vague.

The court held that the handful of subscribers to appellant's paper within the respondent's boundaries was not a &quot;substantial distribution of paid subscribers,&quot; the requirement of &sect; 6008 for a finding of general circulation.

Defendants appealed, contending that &sect;&sect; 225, 225.1 were unconstitutional under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl.3. Plaintiffs countered that the exemptions were valid or, alternatively, that defendants lacked standing. The court reversed the lower court's judgment, holding that &sect;&sect; 225, 225.1 violated the constitution because they interfered with Congress's power over commerce in exempting foreign goods from ad valorem taxes without extending the same protection to interstate goods.

The court held that, under state law, plaintiff's property was exempted as foreign goods from taxation where interstate goods were not exempted, thus, the state law violated the federal constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant candidate challenged by means of an action to recover moneys paid the assessment of costs for the election pamphlets published by respondent rapid transit district. Respondent demurred to appellant's cause of action on the basis that the superior court lacked jurisdiction, the demurrer was sustained and the complaint dismissed, and appellant sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal and held that if the action involved the legality of a tax, import, assessment, toll, or municipal fine, it was within the superior court's jurisdiction; but where, as here, the contested costs were for the specific purpose of reimbursing the public utility for a service rendered, were not routinely levied, and were limited to the public entity's expenses, the charges were not normal taxes, imposts, or assessments and did not raise issues of statewide importance in the interpretation of the statute and the legality of the levy. Thus, the court concluded, the superior court was without jurisdiction over appellant's complaint, and respondent's demurrer was properly sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner pled guilty in two cases to robbery in the first degree, and was sentenced in each case under the Indeterminate Sentence Law to five years in prison, to run concurrently. At a subsequent serious offender hearing, the Community Release Board (CRB) imposed an additional 12-month term to petitioner's sentence under the Determinate Sentencing Act (DSA), pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170.2(a). On appeal by the state, following the trial court's issuance of writ of habeas corpus to petitioner, the court reversed the writ and found that the CRB had the authority under the DSA to impose the additional period. The court determined that the express language of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170.2(b) specifically authorized the CRB to increase the base term, in accordance with the formula set forth in &sect; 1170.2(a), due to the number of crimes of which petitioner was convicted The court found that the authority granted to the CRB by the legislature was not an unlawful delegation of judicial function to the executive branch because the CRB's recalculation of the term was not a resentencing but rather a means to achieve the legislative objective of uniform treatment of offenders.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed summary judgment for defendant county and its employees and granted a petition for a peremptory writ of mandate for defendant city and its employees.

Although the verdict did not bar plaintiff's case, the court held that plaintiff's action was barred by the previous federal action because plaintiff had attempted to split a single cause of action. The federal action was designed to vindicate the same primary right plaintiff sought in the state action, his interests in the personal property converted and withheld by defendants.

R. Ct. 439(b), holding that when defendant pled guilty to the offenses and the enhancements, he gave up his right to the use of the higher standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also held that this was not a violation of due process of the law, because defendant had the right to a trial in which the higher standard would have been used.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment by the trial court to sentence defendant to the upper term of imprisonment for each count to which he pled guilty, for it was permissible to impose such terms upon the findings of aggravated circumstances by a preponderance of the evidence rather than beyond a reasonable doubt, because defendant could have requested a trial and not plead guilty.</SPAN></P>

XIV and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000e et seq., and enjoining enforcement of certain provisions of the program.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city employees challenged an affirmative action program (AAP) that set up racial quotas in hiring and promoting city employees instituted by appellants, city, council, and officials. Affirming the trial court's decision that AAP violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, and title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000e et seq., the court held that the racial classifications failed to pass strict scrutiny. The court found that the quotas were not warranted by a compelling governmental interest and the procedures were not necessary to implement the interest. The court reasoned that the establishment of racial quotas was not necessary because the city had no history of discriminatory employment practices. The court reversed the denial of attorney's fees, holding that the trial court should have determined the propriety and amount of attorney's fees because they were expressly provided for in 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000e-5k. The court found that the trial court's refusal to issue a writ of mandamus was proper because ordering the promotion of respondents would have been equivalent to mandating the exercise of discretion in a particular manner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father filed an action against respondent state and its employees after his daughter was killed by a parolee, alleging, among other things, that respondents negligently paroled the inmate, failed to supervise him, and violated the Civil Rights Act because the act of paroling the inmate deprived the daughter of her life and liberty. The trial court sustained respondents' demurrer and appellant sought review. The court affirmed the trial court's decision and held that both discretionary decisions, such as paroling the inmate, and their ministerial implementation, such as the supervising the parolee, fell under the blanket of immunity provided by Cal. Gov't Code. &sect; 845.8. The court found that respondent employees were acting within their official capacity and were immune from suit under the Civil Rights Act and that &sect; 845.8 was constitutional because there was a rational relationship between the state's purposes and the statute. Finally, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend because the facts were undisputed, the nature of the claim was clear, but there was no liability under substantive law.</SPAN></P>

Defendant tried to sell phony bottles of expensive perfume; the bottles' imitation contents were of little or no value. The lower court granted defendant's motion, over the people's objection, to amend the information to charge a misdemeanor; the people appealed the lower court's order. The court held that defendant was properly charged with the felony offense. Defendant cross-appealed, contending that the evidence upon which his misdemeanor plea and conviction were founded was unconstitutionally seized by the officers. The court held that the officers, from the information known to them at the time, had probable cause to seize the bottled substances produced by defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected criminal defendant's claim that his petition for writ of mandate to compel respondent municipal court to vacate his prior conviction for misdemeanor drunk driving under Cal.

Defendant had argued that his prior conviction was unconstitutional because prior to accepting his guilty plea, respondent had not made an inquiry as to the factual basis for the plea, and thus there was not a valid or intelligent waiver by defendant of his rights. Further, defendant argued that the absence of a factual determination requirement constituted a deprivation of equal protection and due process rights under the state constitution, Cal. Const. art.

The court held that the legislature had classified the offense as a misdemeanor, which did not require a factual determination by respondent, and such classification was constitutionally permissible because it was made for a lawful state purpose and bore a rational relationship to that purpose.

After a judgment in favor of plaintiff, defendants appealed based on their contention that their rental agreement had been void because of plaintiff's failure to secure the certificate of occupancy required by Pasadena, Cal., Ordinance No. 5121. The court found that the ordinance in question was constitutional. Because the lease was invalid under the ordinance, plaintiff could not recover for back rent, although he could legally evict defendants. Finally, a minor defect in the notice to defendants did not require that the judgment against defendants be reversed. Thus, the court modified the judgment and affirmed as modified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment with modification, holding that defendants were correct that plaintiff's failure to secure a certificate of occupancy required by a constitutional local ordinance meant that the lease was invalid and that plaintiff could not recover back rent from defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers brought a taxpayers' action against defendant police and sought to enjoin them from expending public funds in the operation of money bail and &quot;own recognizance&quot; release systems as they existed in the county. The trial court upheld some aspects of the bail and release programs but determined that the existing system of pretrial detention violated procedural due process. Both parties challenged this decision. This court reversed with directions to dismiss the action because resort to a taxpayers' action under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 526a was unnecessary in a matter such as this where a ready hearing was available to a person directly affected by the challenged practice. The purpose of &sect; 526a was to permit adjudication of challenges against governmental action that might otherwise never have been heard for lack of a party with standing to sue as a plaintiff. In this action any accused person who did not obtain release on bail or on his own recognizance had standing to challenge the alleged due process and equal protection violations suffered under the money bail and &quot;own recognizance&quot; release systems.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff doctor was sued by decedent's heirs for wrongful death. After an amended complaint was filed deleting a punitive damages cause of action, plaintiff sued defendant attorneys for abuse of process, alleging that defendants had filed suit although the punitive damages cause did not lie under Cal.

The court held that although &sect; 377 did limit recovery of heirs suing for punitive damages, the privilege granted by Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 47(2) was intended to allow free access to the courts in order to allow, among other things, for the testing of the validity of statutes. Thus, where the constitutionality of Cal. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant developmentally disabled person was a voluntary resident at a state hospital.

Appellant challenged the commitment order on the basis that voluntary or nonprotesting state hospital patients were subject to a less exacting standard than other developmentally disabled persons insofar as the commitment of any other developmentally disabled patient required a finding that the patient was a danger to himself or others. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, holding that there was no discernible state interest upon which to justify the statutory distinction between developmentally disabled persons who are voluntary residents of a state hospital and all other developmentally disabled persons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After conviction of misdemeanor drunk driving, Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23101, petitioner sought habeas corpus, which the California Supreme Court sent back to the court. The court summarily rejected petitioner's claim that the municipal court gave him a greater punishment, 120 days in jail, a $ 500 fine, and six-month suspension of driving license and privileges, because he demanded a jury trial. The court, however, granted the writ because of petitioner's claim that the municipal court augmented his punishment because of the belief he both committed and suborned perjury. The court explained because the consideration of perjury in the appraisal of a defendant's character ran the risk of being improperly expanded to support the imposition of punishment for the perjury itself, rather than going to amenability to rehabilitation, the trial judge who injected the subject into the sentencing process should have expressly stated that its consideration was not to punish the perjury, which would have violated due process. The court rejected plaintiff's argument of cruel and unusual punishment as bordering on the frivolous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the order of the Superior Court of Butte County (California), which entered judgment in favor of respondent Butte County Department of Social Welfare (California), declaring appellant's six minor children free from parental custody and control pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 232(a)(2), (7).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a long history of neglect and poor record of parental visitation while appellant's minor children were in foster care, respondent Butte County Department of Social Welfare (California) petitioned to have appellant's minor children declared free from parental custody and control pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 232(a)(2), (7). The trial court granted the petitions. The court reversed the judgment, and remanded the cause for the sole purpose of applying the standard of clear and convincing evidence as to certain factual findings of neglect under &sect; 232(a)(2). The court rejected appellant's remaining contentions. The distinctions in burdens of proof for termination of parental rights provided by &sect; 232(a)(2) and &sect; 232(a)(7) were justified by the state's compelling interest in promotion of child welfare, even though a rational basis for the distinction would have sufficed due to the absence of a suspect classification. The court rejected appellant's contention that evaluation of parental conduct should be restricted to the two-year foster home period, and held that a parent's conduct prior to that period could be considered in evaluating parents' ability to care for their children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed, and the cause remanded only for the purpose of considering certain factual determinations of parental neglect under the clear and convincing evidence standard. The trial court had erroneously applied the preponderance of evidence test to the question of parental neglect. However, there was no constitutional defect in the statutory tests for determining whether parental rights should be terminated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer had sued for declaratory and injunctive relief, seeking to restrain enforcement of Cal.

The trial court entered judgment in favor of respondent and then denied appellant's motion for a new trial or to vacate the judgment. On appeal, the court determined that the result reached by respondent, which was the regulation of compensation of insurer's general agents, was not arbitrary, capricious, or entirely lacking in evidentiary support. The court noted that the regulation was designed to see that benefits provided to insureds were reasonable in relation to premiums charged. The court affirmed, finding that respondent possessed the power to limit commissions payable to agents within his statutory control and that no constitutional rights had been infringed by the statutes in question.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff home buyers filed an action against defendant builders seeking damages based on negligence and strict liability in the construction of property they bought. After purchasing the property, plaintiffs discovered that a section of patio wall had fallen. Plaintiffs determined that the land was unstable and that the residence had suffered substantial structural distress requiring considerable reconstruction. The trial court dismissed plaintiffs' action as time-barred by Cal. Civ. Code &sect;&sect; 337.1(a), 337.15(a). The court reversed, holding that if retroactive application of the statute of limitations deprived plaintiffs of a reasonable opportunity to exercise their remedy, retroactive application was unconstitutional as to plaintiffs. When plaintiffs discovered the latent defect, operation of the statute of limitations would have reduced the time they had to bring an action to two months and five days. Under prior law, they would have had three years after notice of the latent defect to commence a cause of action. Therefore, &sect; 337.15 reduced their period to file to a reasonable time after the discovery of the defect, which plaintiffs had met by filing within five months.</SPAN></P>

Retroactive application of the statute of limitations had deprived plaintiffs of a reasonable time within which to bring an action after discovering a latent defect. Plaintiffs' filing five months after the discovery was thus timely.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the dismissal because appellant could not invoke the benefit of &sect; 721, which provided for an independent action against an estate up to the limits of a decedent's liability insurance, and because &sect; 721 did not have retroactive application. The court held that appellant's claim was not revived by the retroactive application of case law declaring the automobile guest statute unconstitutional because the claim for personal injuries was barred by the statute of limitations set forth in Cal.

Additionally, the court held that because the California Legislature had enacted a statutory scheme, and sterilization was a very serious and irreversible procedure, common law foundations for the authority to compel sterilization were insufficient safeguard's of an individual's rights. Finally, the court held that any action by the court in contravention of the controlling statute would amount to an unacceptable judicial encroachment on the province of the legislature, and the court affirmed the lower court's order denying appellant's request.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant junk metal dealers challenged the jury's verdict convicting them of buying water meters from a plainclothes police officer without using due diligence to determine whether the officer had authority to sell meters that belonged to a public utility, an offense criminalized under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 496a. Defendants bought the meters as scrap metal without ascertaining the seller's identity or authority to sell the meters. Defendants also selectively omitted the seller's name and address from certain business records. Defendants were given misdemeanor sentences reduced to probation. On appeal, the court held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 496a was not a strict liability offense and that the jury had not been instructed that it was. Cal. Penal Code &sect; 496a was not void for vagueness because the statutory phrase &quot;ordinarily used by&quot; an entity &quot;engaged in furnishing public utility service&quot; gave a person of reasonable intelligence notice of the prohibited conduct. The state's use of expert testimony to establish defendants' lack of due diligence was not prejudicial error. The court affirmed defendants' convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant secretary of state challenged the trial court's order that issued a peremptory writ of mandate to place respondent independent candidate on the ballot in a special election without his first collecting 500 signatures as required by Cal.

The court determined that &sect; 6831 was applicable under the statutory scheme and coincided with appellant's interpretation of the statute that required respondent to obtain 500 signatures, while established party candidates needed only to collect 40.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, independent candidate, voters, and political party, appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which sustained defendant state officials' general demurrer and dismissed plaintiffs' complaint, which alleged that Cal. Elec. Code &sect; 7203&nbsp;unconstitutionally infringed voters' rights to vote. Plaintiffs contended that an unfair burden was placed on independent candidates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff independent candidate was the only independent candidate in a field of 13, and placed 11th, in a special primary election called to fill an assembly vacancy. No candidate received a majority of the votes cast. Accordingly, pursuant to Cal. Elec. Code &sect; 7203, the leading candidate from each of the Democrat and Republican parties was named on the general election ballot. Plaintiff independent candidate's name was omitted from the general election ballot because he was not a member of a &quot;qualified political party.&quot; Plaintiffs, independent candidate, voters, and political party, filed a petition for writ of mandate to defendant state officials to invalidate &sect; 7203 or, in the alternative, to order plaintiff independent candidate's name included on the ballot. The court reversed a dismissal of the action. Section 7203 unfairly imposed a burden on independent candidates that was not imposed on party-affiliated candidates, and unconstitutionally infringed the right to vote, whether tested under the &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; or &quot;rational basis&quot; test.</SPAN></P>

The statute that limited the candidates who could be named on the general election ballot in the event no candidate received a majority of votes in a primary election was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant labor councils sought review of an order of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), that sustained the demurrer without leave to amend of respondent college regents, and denied the request of appellants for a mandamus to compel respondents to comply with the prevailing wage law contained in Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 92611, and holding that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant labor councils, on behalf of labor organizations representing employees of respondent college regents, sought a mandamus compelling respondents to comply with the statutory requirements establishing minimum salary limits for the representative class, as set out in Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 92611. The trial court sustained respondents' demurrer without leave to amend, finding the statute unconstitutional under Cal. Const. art. IX, &sect; 9. In reversing, the court held that its analysis revealed no infirmity in the statute or any irreconcilable conflict with the relevant constitutional provisions. The court found that in areas concerning a subject matter of statewide concern, the legislature had plenary power to adopt general laws promoting the public welfare that were binding upon respondents. Further, a legislatively declared purpose to preempt a field was entitled to great weight, and regulation in the field of labor relations was within the exclusive province of the legislature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment sustaining respondent college regents general demurrer was reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion because the prevailing wage statute sought to be enforced by appellant labor councils was not in fatal conflict with the state constitution. The court upheld the validity of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, grand jury members, filed a public report that contained the statement that plaintiff engineering firm had been negligent, incompetent, and wrong in the performance of its duties.

The trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and concluded that a grand jury was a judicial body and was entitled to full immunity. The court reversed the dismissal and held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 930 applied both to grand jury reports on county officers and reports on special districts. Section 930 stated that if any grand jury commented upon any person or official who had not been indicted by the grand jury, such comments were not deemed to be privileged. The court found that although the sections preceding &sect; 930 only mentioned reports on county officers and not reports concerning special districts, it was difficult to conceive of any legislative objective that would have been furthered by eliminating the privilege in connection with county officers but not special districts within the county.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent sold its marine facility to appellant. Respondent also leased two large cranes located on that property to respondent. Appellant then sued respondent for refund of taxes levied on its possessory interest in the cranes. The trial court determined that the cranes were fixtures and denied appellant's claim. Appellant sought the court's review. The court held that in determining whether an article constituted a fixture, three criteria were considered: the manner of its annexation to the realty, its adaptability to the use and purpose for which the realty was used, and the intention with which the annexation was made. Intent was the overriding factor, and was manifested by the physical facts. The facts here demonstrated that the cranes were extremely heavy, that they comprised a necessary, and working part of the rails attached to the property, and that without the cranes, the rails would lose their significance, and the property would not function in accordance with its purpose and design. Therefore, the cranes were properly considered constructively attached to the realty, and fully adapted to its use, and as a consequence, fixtures thereof. Judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner brought a petition for a writ of habeas corpus challenging the validity of the injunction. Petitioner argued that the trial court did not conduct a &quot;full adversary hearing&quot; on the issue whether the film was obscene and that the trial court did not view the film for the purpose of resolving this issue. The court held the law did not prohibit a preliminary injunction pending a final determination on the merits of the obscenity issue. The court reasoned that the law only required that a prompt final judicial decision be available and any final adjudication be the result of a full adversary hearing. Moreover, the court held that Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 527(a) provided that a preliminary injunction could be issued on the basis of affidavits alone.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was sentenced to serve one year in county jail, the maximum sentence under the statute, following her conviction of violating Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11550. Petitioner contended that both the one-year maximum sentence and the mandatory minimum sentence of 90 days in jail called for by the statute violated the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that the arrest report submitted indicated that petitioner had track marks on her arm, old scar tissue, and six recent puncture wounds. Based on this limited record, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the maximum penalty. The court further found that petitioner's reliance on Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23105, which regulated driving under the influence, was not justified because &sect; 23105 was part of a scheme regulating vehicular traffic, not drug traffic. Furthermore, the law was reasonable in light of other states which had chosen to penalize illicit drug use. The court held that &sect; 11550 did not violate her equal protection rights even though certain drugs were not included in the statute because the state was not required to strike all evils at the same time.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance was reasonable and constitutional on its face, there was no invidious discrimination against any particular class of newspaper and specifically none against respondent, and there was no unequal protection of the law as the ordinance was applied to respondent. The trial court simply granted summary judgment to respondent on the basis that the statute was unconstitutional. An issue of fact remained as to whether or not the ordinance favored the dailies to the detriment or actual exclusion of the weeklies.</SPAN></P>

The evidence in support of the charge that she gave false reasons for absence from duty was supplied by her own admission and was confirmed by her husband's testimony so that defendant's finding on that charge was supported by substantial evidence. The finding that plaintiff was rude and insulting, used profanity, and was insubordinate was established by the testimony of fellow employees who witnessed the incidents and by her admission that she engaged in a personal dispute and used profanity with another deputy.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 1029 was not unconstitutional or violative of any equal protection clauses. More specifically, the court held that ex-felons were not a &quot;suspect classification&quot; nor did the occupations encompassed by &sect; 1029 constitute fundamental interests to which a constitutional guarantee attached. The court also held that the statute bore a reasonable relationship to the legitimate state purpose of avoiding any appearance to the public that persons holding public positions were in any way untrustworthy. The court also found that &sect; 1029 was not violative of due process of law on its face or in its application nor was it violative of federal and state guarantees of equal employment opportunities because its disqualification of ex-felons was not unconnected to the public expectation of peace officers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first degree burglary after stealing a television from a retirement complex. At sentencing, the trial court imposed the upper limit sentence for burglary, finding aggravating factors such as appellant's parole, appellant's prior crimes as an adult that became more serious, and appellant's occasional use of heroin. The trial court then added three one-year sentences as enhancement for three prior convictions and stayed the enhancement of one term that was served concurrently with another crime. The court affirmed the judgment and sentence. The court held that under the Determinate Sentencing Act, Cal. Penal Code &sect;1170.3, and Cal. R. Ct. 42, the trial court was permitted to consider factors that related to appellant's overall behavior and not just to the crime. The court held that the factors considered for aggravation and the prior convictions considered for sentence enhancement differed, as the trial court used the fact that appellant was on parole for the aggravation and used the prior convictions for enhancement. The court held that the additional enhancement terms did not violate appellant's guarantee against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

The order denying plaintiff's petition was therefore reversed, and the case was remanded with instructions for issuance of plaintiff's writ of mandate and of an order compelling defendant to vacate its order. The court rejected plaintiff's contentions that defendant failed to investigate the industry or consider wage board recommendations before issuing its order as required by Cal. Lab.

The court affirmed, holding that the state legislature's delegation of the teaching function did not constitute a transfer of a part of the public school system. Nor did the statutes authorize the appropriation or expenditure of public funds in support of any school not under the exclusive control of the officers of the public schools. Therefore, the state constitution was not violated by the statutes relied upon by defendant.</SPAN></P>

Merely because an establishment had a stage, fixed seats, and entertainment did not make that establishment a &quot;theater.&quot; Situations provided a rational basis to treat differently nude performers in theaters, on the one hand, and nude performers, waiters, and waitresses in establishments such as plaintiffs' on the other. It was obvious that the sale of food and beverage, encouraged and promoted by the presentation of nudity for the sake of sexual titillation, rather than the rendition of any First Amendment-protected entertainment, was the primary purpose of plaintiffs' establishment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, grantee under a grant deed, claimed property pursuant to a grant deed executed by the fee title owner. Defendants, grantees under a treasurer's deed, claimed the same property under a deed from the city dated three months later. The latter deed resulted from the foreclosure of a street lighting assessment lien under the Street Improvement Act of 1911, Cal. Sts. &amp; High. Code &sect; 5000 et seq. Plaintiff and his predecessor did not receive notice of the foreclosure because the city sent notices to a prior owner who was dead. Plaintiff filed a declaratory judgment action, claiming that the treasurer's deed was void for constitutionally deficient notice, and that therefore, the statute of limitations did not bar the suit. The trial court dismissed the action. The court reversed and held that plaintiff's allegations of defects in the tax proceedings were jurisdictional, and therefore sustained the complaint under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3412. The court also held that the procedures outlined in Cal. Sts. &amp; High. Code &sect;&sect; 6501, 6502, and 6503 were constitutional, but that the city's failure to ascertain the real owner of the property before selling the property was a denial of due process.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 261.5 and oral copulation, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288a, with a 16-year old girl. Both parties consented to the sexual activity. Appellant pled guilty to misdemeanor violation of &sect; 261.5. Appellant sought reversal, challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 261.5, which proscribed sexual intercourse with a female under 18 years of age who was not the perpetrator's wife. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 261.5 was a proper exercise of the legislature's police power and that the classification was reasonable and bore a genuine and substantial relationship to the object of the legislature. The court found that the sexes were not similarly situated to the state's interest in preventing pregnancy in females under 18 years of age, as females could become pregnant and males could not, males could not suffer as seriously as females the adverse medical, social, and psychological consequences of teenage pregnancy. The court held that the statute did not violate appellant's right to privacy under Cal. Const. art.

Appellant engaged in activity, such as picketing, which led appellee to seek injunctive relief to prevent appellant from engaging in improper or illegal picketing of its premises. The trial court granted a preliminary injunction enjoining appellant from blocking access or deliveries to the restaurant, threatening and/or committing acts of intimidation and physical violence on anyone working for or desiring to do business with appellee restaurant, and disturbing the peace. Appellant sought review of a decision denying a motion to dissolve based on a retroactive application of Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 527.3. The court affirmed the denial of the motion, holding that the preliminary injunction was a decree continuing in nature directed at future events and that &sect; 527.3 did apply. The court held that nothing in &sect; 527.3(b) prevented a court from placing reasonable restrictions on picketing where the absence of such restrictions had resulted in threats of violence and that under &sect; 527.3 the courts needed not wait until actual violence erupted.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that appellants' failure to exhaust their administrative remedies, by applying for a variance, before pursuing their lawsuit was a jurisdictional defect. The court found that appellants' refusal to apply for a zoning variance or a building or use permit foreclosed any action attacking the validity of the zoning ordinance, finding that it was not certain that they would have received an adverse decision on any such application.

The board held that appellant had to submit to a psychiatric examination for determination of his emotional ability to practice medicine and on resumption of practice, he was to be on probation for a five-year period.

The court affirmed the trial court's finding that there was an inverse condemnation based on substantial evidence, which showed that defendant would deny any application for industrial development on the land because of the open space designation, that the land had no economic use, and that no one would buy it. Therefore, the court held that compensation for the value of the property was properly awarded, and it also affirmed the trial court's calculation of interest on the award from the date of the taking rather than from the date of the judgment. The award of severance damages was affirmed because the use of the condemned parcel was not dissimilar to that of the remainder parcel, and there was access between the two parcels.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which convicted him of lewd and lascivious conduct on a child under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288. Defendant argued that his registration as a sex offender constituted cruel and unusual punishment; that it violated the equal protection clause; it impinged on his right to travel, his privacy, and infringed on his right of freedom of association and movement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of lewd and lascivious conduct on a child and given probation. As a condition of probation, defendant was required to register as a convicted sex offender, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 290, and ordered not to have any contact with minors, nor frequent places where they congregated unless in he did so in the presence of responsible adults. On appeal, defendant argued that registration was cruel and unusual punishment; it violated the equal protection clause; it impinged on his right to travel and his privacy; and it infringed on this right to freedom of association and movement. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the registration requirement was not out of all proportion to the crime and was not cruel and unusual punishment. Moreover, defendant's equal protection claim was without merit, because the state had a compelling interest in protecting children and conviction for such a crime carried with it a reduction to some degree of defendant's rights to privacy, travel and freedom of association.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding that registration was not cruel and unusual punishment because it was not disproportionate to the crime committed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant engine owner challenged a decision of the Superior Court of Orange County (California), which entered judgment discharging an alternative writ and denying a peremptory writ sought by appellant to prevent the destruction or disposition of a motorcycle engine, pursuant to Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 10751(b), without notice or a hearing, because the vehicle identification numbers had been altered, in violation of Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 10751(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent police seized appellant engine owners' motorcycle because the vehicle identification numbers had been altered, and impounded the engine. Appellant filed an action for a peremptory writ to prevent the destruction or disposition of the motorcycle engine, pursuant to Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 10751(b), without notice or a hearing, because the vehicle identification numbers had been altered in violation of Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 10751(a). The trial court discharged the alternative writ that had been obtained and denied the peremptory writ. On appeal, the only issue was the constitutionality of &sect; 10751(b), which provided for destruction or disposition, without notice and hearing, of vehicles or vehicle parts seized pursuant to &sect; 10751(a). The court declared that &sect; 10751(b), violated the due process requirement of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 and U.S. Const. amend XIV because it failed to provide for a notice and hearing prior to forfeiture of property. Appellant had a constitutional right to the return of the property or a noticed hearing where she was given the opportunity to oppose respondent's intended forfeiture and destruction of it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court order denying a peremptory writ to prevent the disposition or destruction of appellant engine owners' motorcycle engine because the statute permitting such action, without notice and an opportunity for hearing, violated the due process requirement of both state and federal constitutions, and there were no exigent circumstances which would warrant an opposite result.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied appellant, a developmentally disabled person, a jury trial in a commitment proceeding. The trial court noted that there was no express statutory provision for jury trials in commitment proceedings under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 38009.1 and Cal.

The court noted that commitment proceedings could result in a substantial loss of liberty, and that the state violated equal protection if it granted jury trials to some groups and denied them to others unless the different treatment was necessary for a compelling state interest. The court reversed the trial court's decision, finding that respondent state regional center had failed to demonstrate a compelling state interest in denying a right to jury trial to developmentally disabled persons. Consequently, appellant, and other developmentally disabled persons, were entitled to a jury trial upon request in commitment proceedings pursuant to Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent trial court denied petitioner corporation's motion to quash service and alternatively to dismiss real party in interest individual's complaint. The court refused to grant a writ of mandate to overturn the trial court's order. The court concluded that although service of process could have properly been made on petitioner's designated agent by any of the methods prescribed for service within the state, the agent was not the only person upon whom service could be made. Among the statutory alternatives open to real party in interest was that of serving by mail a copy of the summons and complaint as provided by Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 415.40. The court found that due process was not violated because &sect; 415.40 provided petitioner with actual notice and an opportunity to be heard. The court also found that &sect; 415.40 did not deny equal protection to petitioner because the non-residence of petitioner necessarily made for a distinctive procedure. The court concluded that a return receipt and a letter were satisfactory evidence of actual delivery to petitioner and that the return of service, as amended, operated to take the case out of the provisions of Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled in favor of appellant hospital corporation on its appeal of four consolidated determinations by respondents Workers' Compensation Board of Appeals and four individuals. Appellant challenged the board's reduction of amount owing on appellant's liens for medical services provided and argued that the board's application of Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 4903.1(c) denied it due process and equal protection. The court applied the rational relationship test and concluded the statute served a legitimate state purpose to encourage compromises and settlements. Added legislative protection provided that settlements were scrutinized by the board to avoid unfairness. Legislative history demonstrated that &sect; 4903.1(c) applied to liens where settlement was not reached prior to January 1, 1976. The court annulled respondent's decisions and remanded for further proceedings because respondent did not comply with due process requirements - by defects in serving notice, by lacking appropriate documentation in serving respondent, and in not providing specific data to reduce appellant's lien recovery.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review arguing that the legislative action which established its residence requirement, and the area involved, was attended by a strong presumption of validity. The court held that the legislative action was reasonable in itself, within the meaning of the permissive constitutional language, insofar as its purpose was to require appellant's public safety employees to live at places from which they could effectively be called to duty when they were needed. However, the mere specification of a distance in miles did not make it reasonable.

The court reasoned that under the theory of the prosecution a defendant might not be eligible for parole after he had served his minimum sentence.

The arresting police officer and investigator testified at the hearing. The court affirmed the revocation of defendant's parole on the basis of the evidence, which was properly admitted under the board's more flexible evidentiary rules. The court held that the Adult Authority had authority and power to issue subpoenas pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 11181. The court ruled that the victim's disappearance provided good cause for her absence and that admission of her prior statements was proper because they were adequately corroborated. The court found that the non-appearance of a second witness was not prejudicial because he was not an adverse witness and deletion of his statement would not have vindicated defendant. The court found that the non-appearance of defendant's companion was not prejudicial because he was not shown to be an adverse witness and defendant could equally have secured his attendance.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained appellee board's findings revoking appellant's funeral license and the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 7738 made it clear that the corpus of the trust could not be used to pay commissions or other trust expenses, and clarified that a licensed cemetery authority need not establish a separate trust for preeneed funeral arrangement funds. Therefore, the preeneed funeral contracts by appellant were not exempt from the requirements under &sect; 7738 because the legislature did not seek to prohibit the potential abuses by funeral directors that happen to be dual licensees, such as appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant minor was charged with a traffic violation, pursuant to Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 21804. Her hearing was conducted by a traffic hearing officer upon a copy of the violation notice, pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 257, and a fine was imposed. Defendant then sought to appeal the determination, but her request for rehearing was denied by the juvenile court traffic division on the findings of the hearing officer. Defendant appealed the denial of the rehearing. The court reversed the juvenile court's order, finding that defendant's constitutional rights to a hearing by a judge had been violated by the appointment of the traffic hearing officer to her case, without the express stipulation of defendant or her family. In addition, the record of the traffic hearing officer was insufficient and did not provide the court with sufficient information to reach an independent judgment.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner sought a writ of certiorari or mandamus, to annul the decision of respondent. The court affirmed the decision, holding that respondent accurately interpreted &sect; 10012.5 as providing municipal agencies the right to bill candidates, but not to enforce the collection of those bills.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents were the wife and son of a tax debtor, and respondents owned two parcels of land once held by debtor. To secure debtor's tax debt, the IRS filed liens on respondents' parcels of land as debtor's nominees. Respondents filed an action to quiet title to the land, and challenged the IRS liens. The trial court granted respondents' motion for summary judgment and held that even though the IRS had the right to file nominee liens, that respondents were denied due process because there was no hearing prior to the attachment of the lien. Appellant federal government sought review and the court reversed and held that the statutory pattern of the internal revenue laws authorized the filing of nominee liens when the IRS had reasonable cause to believe that the property against which the lien was filed might have been transferred to a third party to avoid creditors, including the federal government, and that the trial court erred in finding that there was an unconstitutional seizure of respondents' property, and that summary judgment was granted improperly because respondents showed no statutory requirement of a hearing prior to filing the nominee lien.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner pleaded guilty to willful failure to provide for a minor child in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 270. Petitioner brought a petition for a writ of habeas corpus challenging the conviction, arguing that &sect; 270 was constitutionally infirm in its unequal and discriminatory classification based upon the sex of the offender. The court ruled that a conviction under an unconstitutional statute could be challenged collaterally, notwithstanding that the conviction was based upon a plea of guilty. Further, the court held that the provisions of &sect; 270 imposing primary criminal liability upon the father for willful failure to provide for a minor child, while holding the mother only secondarily liable, violated the equal protection guarantee of the state and federal constitutions. Also, the court found that the state's interest in securing support for minor children, and in relieving the public burden where parents were able to provide such support, was better served by a law which made each parent equally responsible. The court granted the petition for a writ of habeas corpus, concluding that proceedings based upon an unconstitutional statute were void and ineffectual.</SPAN></P>

The court found that new residents were not a suspect class, but that strict scrutiny was applicable because the provision denied new residents their fundamental right to travel. The penalty imposed on the right to travel was the deprivation of the right to hold public office.

The court held U.S.C.S. &sect; 360k did not preempt the field because Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 26463 did not meet the first two elements of preemption: &sect; 26463 contained a flat prohibition, not a requirement, and there was no showing that hearing aids were classified as restricted devices. The court reversed the denial of attorney fees for plaintiffs and held Cal. Civ. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in a trial court (California) of a violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11360(a), sale of marijuana, after a jury verdict of guilty. Defendant appealed from an order of the trial court granting probation. The most important question on appeal was whether the trial court should have allowed evidence to be introduced relevant to entrapment and should have given requested defense instructions on entrapment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that a doctrine of second-degree entrapment applied to her case. Defendant stated that her brother was entrapped by the police and that the police officer then persuaded her brother to place the idea of committing the crime in her mind where there was no preexisting intent. Defendant, however, was convicted of the sale of marijuana after a jury verdict of guilty and received probation. Defendant appealed from an order of the California trial court granting probation. The primary question on appeal was whether the trial court should have allowed evidence to be introduced relevant to entrapment and should have given requested defense instructions on entrapment. The court found the entrapment advanced by the defendant to be a type of second-degree entrapment that was advanced in dictum of two California cases, subsequently rejected by all courts where such a defense was attempted. Concluding that entrapment existed as a defense to prevent the police or their agents from using persuasive wiles to lead an otherwise innocent person astray, the court affirmed the trial court order sentencing defendant to probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court order granting probation to defendant for conviction of the sale of marijuana. The court rejected defendant's assertion of a doctrine of second-degree entrapment. The court noted that the dictum relied upon by defendant in former cases was repudiated by other courts reviewing cases brought under a similar theory of entrapment, and that entrapment existed as a defense as a check on police authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant County of San Diego Board of Supervisors adopted a resolution for detachment of certain land from plaintiff Morro Hills Community Services District subject to a condition which would relieve that property from the obligation of existing bonded indebtedness unless it reallocated the obligation to an affected city, county or district. Plaintiff filed a suit for declaratory relief, challenging the validity of defendant's action under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 860 et seq., and alleging that defendant abused its discretion in adopting the resolution. The trial court held that the detachment, conditioned as it was here, was invalid. On defendant's appeal, the court reversed. Interpreting Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 56470(c) and 56492, the court found that the condition exempted the property from taxes, including taxes for payment of the bonded indebtedness, but did not eliminate the property's being subjected to liability, where otherwise necessary for payment of the bond obligation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner prisoner sought a writ of habeas corpus, contending that the penalty provision of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11360(a) under which he was sentenced was unconstitutional insofar as it provided for a three-year minimum period for eligibility for parole. Petitioner was sentenced to prison on September 26, 1975, and all of the trial court's proceedings were completed before July 1, 1977, the operative date of the Uniform Determinate Sentencing Act of 1976 (the Act), Cal.

The court held that the trial court's judgment was either moot or premature. The court held that under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170.2(a) of the Act, petitioner was entitled to a review by the California Community Release Board (board) to determine what the length of time of imprisonment would have been under &sect; 1170.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, inmates found not guilty by reason of insanity, were involuntarily committed. Petitioners applied for release but were moved to a county jail pending the restoration-to-sanity hearing. Petitioners sought a habeas corpus review of their confinement in county jail. The court denied the writs because petitioners had previously been released from custody. The court ruled, however, that jail confinement violated petitioners' right to protection against unjust confinement. While the court observed that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1026 appeared to provide for jail confinement during the hearing and evaluation process, the court ruled that the statute's reliance on other procedures set forth by the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (LPS), Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 5000 et seq., for dealing with those involuntarily committed, indicated legislative intent to follow LPS procedures. Under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 5150, the court observed that petitioners, while undergoing the evaluation and treatment process, could only have been confined in a treatment and evaluation facility approved by the state. Consequently, the court ruled that only confinement in such a facility would have been proper.</SPAN></P>

No unfair labor practice occurred, because the ALRA expressly excluded farm labor contractors, and the camp operator was not the special emissary of a farm operator. The court also concluded that the camp operator's property interests were outweighed by constitutional free speech concerns, since no alternative effective means of communicating with the camp residents existed, and defendants' entry into the camp was brief. The absence of an essential element of trespass with respect to the defendant who was not asked to leave created independent grounds for reversal. Accordingly, the judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant union organizers' conviction for criminal trespass was reversed. Jurisdiction was proper, but the constitutional right to free speech was violated when defendants were denied access to a farm labor camp, because no effective alternative way was available for them to communicate with resident farm workers about an upcoming union election.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order of the juvenile court (California) that sustained charges for driving a vehicle without the owner's consent and receiving a credit card that was stolen property. Defendant claimed that the stolen property charge should have been brought under a code provision that specifically involved credit cards, and that the disposition order incorrectly allowed confinement for a period that exceeded his 21st birthday.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile was adjudicated a ward of the state and recommitted to the Youth Authority after the juvenile court sustained charges for driving a vehicle without the owner's consent and receiving a credit card that was stolen property. On appeal, defendant argued that he should have been charged under a more specific section of the penal code that involved credit cards, and that the length of the confinement allowed in the disposition order was improper. The court held that prosecution under the more general statute for receiving stolen property was appropriate. The court reasoned that the legislature did not distinguish between general or special statutes, as long as the criminal activities charged were within the proscribed scope of such enactments. The court also concluded that the judgment required modification because the maximum period of defendant's confinement, calculated according to applicable determinate sentencing laws, exceeded the jurisdictional limit of his 21st birthday. Accordingly, the disposition order was modified to recite that defendant not be held beyond his 21st birthday, and the judgment as modified was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of conviction was affirmed, because no distinction existed between general or special statutes, as long as the criminal acts for which a defendant was charged fell within the proscribed scope of a legislative enactment. The sentence was modified, because the maximum period of confinement permitted by the consecutive sentences imposed upon defendant went past his 21st birthday, and exceeded the juvenile court's jurisdictional limit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the state, sought a writ of mandate after respondent, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, and not the community release board, sentenced the real party in interest to a specific term of imprisonment contrary to Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 1168(b), 1170(a)(2), and 1170.2(a) and (b) (1977).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After respondent, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, sentenced the real party in interest to imprisonment for six months to two years following a probation violation for a crime committed in 1973, petitioner, the state, sought a writ of mandate. Petitioner contended that respondent's judgment erroneously specified the length of the prison term rather than sentencing &quot;the term prescribed by law&quot; according to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1168(b) and &sect; 1170(a)(2) (1977) and that, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170.2(a) and (b) (1977), the community release board (CRB), not respondent, was responsible for fixing the imprisonment term. The court issued an alternative writ, vacated the order, and instructed that a new sentencing hearing be held. It noted that the legislature amended &sect;&sect; 1170 and 1170.2 in order to make the date of the criminal act determinative. Thus, defendants sentenced after July 1, 1977 for crimes committed prior to that date should have imprisonment terms fixed by the CRB. This approach did not improperly delegate powers because the legislative body provided the sentence, the judicial branch imposed it, and the administrative body simply carried it out.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the request of petitioner, the state, to issue a peremptory writ of mandate. The court directed respondent superior court to vacate its order sentencing real party in interest to prison for six months to two years and to conduct a new sentencing hearing. It was constitutionally sound for statutory law to empower the community release board, not respondent, to fix imprisonment terms.</SPAN></P>

All four counts involved the same prostitute; they differed only as to the dates of the alleged offense. On appeal, the court modified the trial court's judgment. The court held that living or deriving support or maintenance from the earnings of a prostitute knowing her to be a prostitute was an ongoing continuing offense that occurred over a period of time. The court held that defendant was guilty of only one count of pimping because there was only one continuous course of conduct involving one prostitute even though it occurred over a long period of time. The court affirmed the condition of probation imposed on defendant that provided defendant was not to work in bars, taxicabs, or other locations suitable for acting as a pimp. The court held that the condition served the statutory ends of probation and was valid because it bore a relationship to the crime of pimping since bars and taxicabs are ideal locations for conducting pimping activities.

Appellants were engaged in international maritime commerce. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that found that the tax was constitutional. The court found that no international treaties prohibited the tax. The court held that the import-export clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 2 did not prohibit the tax because the tax reached only the dockside handling of imported and exported goods by appellants' employees; the tax did not reach the goods themselves. The court held that the tax was not prohibited by the commerce clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, because the tax reached a taxable nexus, it was fairly apportioned to a local activity, it did not discriminate against employees engaged in foreign commerce since it was imposed on all employers in the city, and it was fairly related to the services provided by respondent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's husband incurred a business debt to plaintiff. The practice of husband and wife had been to keep their earnings segregated with each spouse paying certain bills. After the husband's death, plaintiff sued defendant wife for the debt. The trial court entered judgment for plaintiff and defendant appealed. The court affirmed the holding that defendant's interest in the community property was subject to the debt owed to plaintiff, but the court said that this did not warrant entry of a judgment against defendant wife personally. The court said that the retroactive effect of 1975 amendments to Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 5116 was not unconstitutional. That statute, as amended, provided that the community was liable for contracts of either spouse made before or after January 1, 1975. Previously the law had provided that the wife's earnings were not liable for the husband's debts. The court said that plaintiff was not entitled to a personal judgment against defendant wife because plaintiff had not shown that defendant wife was unjustly enriched or that the net value of the community estate had been diminished.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant commission's minority preference order violated the Sacramento County Charter and exceeded the authority granted by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII). The order injected racial, ethnic, and gender qualifications into a hiring system whose charter commanded disregard of race, ethnicity, and gender. The order violated the competitive qualification and anti-discrimination provisions of the charter. The action of defendant commission overstepped the objective of Title VII, which was the removal of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment when the barriers operated invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or other impermissible classifications, and established a barrier to the employment of majority applicants.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found the employee lists set forth the current street addresses to the extent such existed and were obtainable and were not deficient. The trial court ruled that real parties had complied with the subpoenas and, therefore, denied petitioner's applications for enforcement orders.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, charged with drug and resisting arrest offenses, sought from real party in interest state discovery of records of the arresting officers' medical, psychiatric, or psychological treatment containing opinions on the officers' character trait for acts of aggression, violence, excessive force, or demonstrating racial or ethnic bias or prejudice. Defendant also sought all crime or arrest reports filed by either officer within the last 10 years involving resisting arrest or battery on a police officer. The lower court denied the request and the appellate court affirmed. Defendant supplied the court with a record insufficient to permit an evaluation of the lower court's exercise of discretion. Further, it was not an abuse of discretion to deny defendant's request for the officers' medical and psychiatric records because they were privileged under Cal. Evid. Code &sect;&sect; 300, 910, 1010-1026. Moreover, the exception of Cal. Evid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Tulare County (California), which held that Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11550 was not unconstitutionally vague.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conduct involving controlled substances was prohibited by Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11550, and a mandatory 90-day sentence was given anyone convicted thereunder. Though defendant had not yet gone to trial, the court reviewed her claims using three distinct techniques: (1) the nature of the offense and the offender, with particular regard to the degree of danger each present to society; (2) a comparison of &sect; 11550's punishment with punishments in the state for more serious offenses; and (3) a comparison of &sect; 11550's penalty with punishment in other states for the same offense. Though the court found &sect; 11550 poorly drafted, because the state had discretion either to prosecute or send offenders to diversion programs, the sentence would not be imposed in every case where &sect; 11550 was violated. Given these factors and the fact that &sect; 11550 did not punish a condition of addiction but rather an act, the court found that the mandatory sentence did not impose cruel and unusual punishment. Because it did not punish status, it did not violate the equal protection clause. The acts prohibited by &sect; 11550 met the reasonable certainty test and thus it was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The court found that appellants had not availed themselves to the variance procedures provided in Mountain View, Cal., Mun. Code &sect; 36.44 and thus failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. The court determined that no exception to the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine had applied because appellants were not irreparably injured by the sign regulations, it would not have been futile for appellants to pursue an administrative remedy, a constitutional challenge required exhaustion of remedies, and appellants' actions had not involved public rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant primary insurers appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court of San Bernardino County (California) that was entered in favor of plaintiff excess insurer in a subrogation action to recover from defendants the amount that plaintiff was required to pay on the judgments that were entered against the estate of defendants' insured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A fatal accident occurred involving a vehicle insured by defendant primary insurers. The policy contained an omnibus clause covering permissive users. After defendants refused to settle for less than their policy limits, wrongful death claims were brought against the estate of the permissive user who was alleged to have been the driver. A judgment was entered against the estate. Defendants paid their policy limits on each judgment and plaintiff excess insurer, which had issued a policy to the permissive user, paid the balance. Plaintiff then sued defendants, claiming that their failure to settle was in bad faith. A judgment was entered for plaintiff and defendants appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that the estate would have had a cause of action against defendants, as primary insurers under Cal. Ins. Code &sect; 11580.9, for a bad faith refusal to settle since the proposed settlement was within the policy limits and was presumed reasonable. Thus, plaintiff, as an excess insurer, could recover from defendants, under equitable subrogation, that amount the estate could have recovered since it suffered a loss by being required to pay the balance of the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed because defendants had refused to settle within the policy limits, creating a cause of action against them by the insured's permissive user, so that plaintiff was subrogated to the permissive user's rights when it made payments on the judgments that were entered against his estate.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and directed the trial court to dismiss their petition. The court held that the trial court had erred in granting relief because respondents failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. The court found that respondents were entitled to appeal the denial of the outside bank account by the superintendent directly to the director of the department and to obtain a ruling within 20 days under the department of corrections' administrative manual.

The court held that defendant was not entitled to a preliminary hearing because he had been indicted by a grand jury.

Defendant also contended that the state failed to prove that a violation of &sect; 424 occurred, that the jury was not instructed concerning specific intent, that his conviction was not a felony, that the prosecutor failed to subpoena campaign volunteers as witnesses before the grand jury, that the acquittal verdict on charges that he presented fraudulent claims under Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In connection with divorce proceedings, appellant ex-wife and respondent ex-husband executed a marital settlement agreement which included a provision in which they warranted to one another that neither was possessed of any property other than what was listed in the agreement, and that if it should later be determined that either was possessed of any property not set forth in the agreement, each agreed to pay one-half of the fair market value of such property to the other. Several years after the divorce was final, appellant brought an order to show cause proceeding in the original divorce action, seeking to enforce the marital settlement agreement as to respondent's military pension, which he had begun collecting since the divorce.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder for killing a police officer and was given the death penalty. In accordance with case law, the Supreme Court transferred the case for modification of appellant's sentence. Appellant contended that his accusation by grand jury indictment instead of by information was unconstitutional in that it denied him the fundamental right of a preliminary hearing at a &quot;critical phase&quot; of the proceedings, in violation of due process and equal protection of law. California courts had already rejected appellant's argument that grand jury accusation without opportunity for preliminary hearing was unconstitutional in other case law. The people contended that appellant should be returned to the trial court for resentencing under the newly adopted death penalty statute. Under the sequence of events in the case, the reviewing court concluded that such an increase in sentence would put appellant in jeopardy of his life a second time. The court modified appellant's sentence to life in prison in the state court. Because of its reduction in appellant's sentence, the court had to modify appellant's other sentences by merging them in to the life sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified appellant's sentence to life in state prison and merged sentences for other convictions into the life sentence because the court found that only life imprisonment could be constitutionally imposed under the death penalty law under which appellant was sentenced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for the murder of a human fetus under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187, and of the sentences he received for that conviction and his convictions of rape under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 261(3), and assault under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 245(a), entered in the Superior Court of Fresno County (California), asserting that the murder statute was vague and that he received impermissible multiple punishment under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 654.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After talking with his ex-wife and disavowing the fetus she was carrying, appellant announced his intent to kill the fetus. Appellant repeatedly struck his ex-wife in the abdomen and raped her, causing her to bleed. Several weeks later, she gave birth to a dead fetus. An expert testified that the death was due to a partial separation of the placenta from the cervix, which could result from a physical trauma inflicted on the mother. Appellant was convicted of the murder of a human fetus, rape by threats of great and immediate bodily harm, and assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 189, 261(3), 245(a), respectively. The court affirmed his convictions, holding that the murder statute was not unconstitutionally vague because a person of common intelligence could reasonably understand what was proscribed. However, the court agreed with appellant that he had been subjected to multiple punishment, finding that he could not be punished for both the rape and the assault because both were part of an indivisible course of conduct intended to kill the fetus. Thus, it modified the judgment to stay the assault sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment to stay appellant's assault sentence pending the finality of its judgment and the service of his rape sentence, with the stay to become permanent when service of sentence as to the rape count was completed. As modified, the court affirmed, rejecting appellant's argument that the murder statute was impermissibly vague as applied to the murder of a human fetus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with 11 felony offenses while incarcerated.

He then entered a second plea bargain for the original 11 offenses, pleading guilty to four of them. Defendant was sentenced to prison and was given credit for time spent as an unsentenced prisoner. He claimed he was entitled to credit for his time in prison on the two counts that were subsequently dismissed as part of the second plea bargain.

Appellant's probation had been revoked, and he had been sentenced to jail for his previous conviction of violating Cal. Penal Code &sect; 270, failure to provide for his minor children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with failure to provide for his minor children, a violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 270. He pled guilty and was placed on probation. Appellant thereafter was found to have been in violation of his probation and was ordered to jail. Appellant sought a writ of prohibition/mandate in superior court, which was denied. Appellant contended that superior court jurisdiction precluded municipal court jurisdiction; his prosecution denied him equal protection of the law; imprisonment for violating &sect; 270 constituted imprisonment for a debt; &sect; 270 was vague and uncertain; and failure to charge the custodial mother constituted invidious discrimination. The court affirmed. The legislature conferred upon the municipal court jurisdiction over criminal cases amounting to a misdemeanor within the ambit of &sect; 270. Appellant was not deprived of equal protection of the law. Where issues, including defenses, may differ in different proceedings, such was not sufficient, without more, to show a denial of equal protection. The statutory obligation of a parent to support his or her minor child was not a debt, and a prosecution under &sect; 270 was not a civil action for debt.</SPAN></P>

His prosecution did not constitute a violation of equal protection, and he had not been sentenced for a debt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People filed a petition seeking a rehearing by the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), asserting that defendant's case should have been remanded for a hearing under newly enacted Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.3 to determine whether the penalty should have been death or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder with a finding of special circumstances which led to a sentence of death. The case was assigned to this court for disposition following a decision which found certain statute unconstitutional. The court modified the judgment of conviction to impose a life sentence instead of the penalty of death. By petition for rehearing, the People asserted that the case should have been remanded for a hearing to determine whether the penalty should have been death or life imprisonment without possibility of parole under the provisions of newly enacted Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.3. The court found that the new statute demonstrably inflicted greater punishment than could have been inflicted under the former statute at the time the act was committed. Denying the petition for rehearing, the court held that the statute adopting a new scheme could not have been applied to defendant who was tried and sentenced under the former law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the People's petition for rehearing on the ground that the new statute relating to punishment could not have been applied to defendant's case, because the statute was not in effect when he committed the offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent filed an in rem proceeding to validate the proposed bond issue. The redevelopment plan (plan) called for conversion of a blighted area into a residential development which would include low-density residential, multi-family residential, and commercial areas. The trial court validated the proposed issuance. On appeal, the court determined that the plan did not involve a gift of public funds or an improper use of a public credit in violation of the state constitution. The proposed bonds were expenditures for public purposes. Providing decent housing for the public was a public purpose. There was no unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to respondent. Lastly, the proposed bond issue did not require voter approval, because the project was one that was developed, constructed or acquired with the meaning of the state constitution. The judgment was therefore affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer sought review of the order of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), which denied his motion that a class action was proper and to certify a class of taxpayers, to be represented by appellant, in his claim that Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 17069(f) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer paid his state income taxes under protest, claiming that Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 17069(f), which allowed a special tax credit to California income taxpayers residing in the state for a full year, but denied it for others who were not residents at the close of the tax year. After his claim for refund was denied by respondent Franchise Tax Board and denied again on appeal by the State Board of Equalization, appellant brought suit as a class action for recovery of personal income tax paid under protest, purporting to represent all others similarly situated. The trial court held that appellant's action was invalid as a class action. If the Legislature has imposed prerequisites to an action against the state or one of its agencies, those conditions must be strictly complied with. It is a condition to filing suit against the Franchise Tax Board to have first filed a claim for refund, per Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect;&sect; 19051- 19064. Appellant filed his claim only on his own behalf, not on behalf of the class; therefore, he could not file a suit to recover on behalf of the class.</SPAN></P>

The court found that juvenile matters were only properly before the prosecuting attorney for determination of wardship if the probation officer requested the prosecuting attorney to take such action by presenting him with an affidavit. Furthermore, the initial determination to file could not be delegated to the prosecuting attorney because it was a judgment expressly vested in the probation department under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), that adjudged him delinquent and committed him to the California Youth Authority. Defendant claimed that he was entitled to a new dispositional hearing to establish that a knife was not used in the robbery for which he was charged, and that he was entitled to presentence credit for time spent in juvenile hall while criminal proceedings were pending.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was committed to the California Youth Authority, he contended he was entitled to credit against his commitment for time spent in juvenile hall while the juvenile proceedings against him were pending. Defendant also argued that he was entitled to a new dispositional hearing to establish that a knife was not used in the robbery for which he was charged. On review, the court held that presentence credit did not apply to the juvenile court system. A declaration of wardship was not a &quot;conviction,&quot; and a dispositional order of the juvenile court was not a &quot;sentence&quot; within the meaning of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 2900.5. The denial of presentence credit to juveniles was not unconstitutional because the distinction between adults and juveniles clearly bore a substantial relationship to a legitimate legislative objective. Defendant's commitment was not an abuse of discretion because it was not based on the nature of the weapon that was used, but on defendant's anti-social behavior as demonstrated by his participation in a robbery after he had participated in three prior robberies and an assault. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed because defendant's commitment was based upon his anti-social behavior as demonstrated by his repeated criminal acts, and not upon the exact nature of the weapon that was used in the robbery for which he was charged. Presentence credit was not permitted because a valid distinction existed between juveniles and adults, and juveniles were not &quot;convicted&quot; or &quot;sentenced&quot; within the meaning of the criminal code.</SPAN></P>

The commonality of the questions of law and fact involved in the action, the community of interest, was adequately set forth in the complaint which alleged the use of a fraudulent canned sales pitch which was designed to and did induce the members to purchase property in a common area.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), that denied his order for class certification in his action seeking compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief pursuant to the Consumers Legal Remedies Act, Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought review after his motion for class certification, in his action seeking relief pursuant to the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (act), Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1750, was denied. The court granted petitioner's petition for writ of mandamus, and reversed the decision denying class certification. The court found that its intervention was warranted via petitioner's request for an extraordinary writ because the issue raised was substantial and one of first impression. The court found that Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1781(b) established exclusive criteria for class certification in suits brought pursuant to the act. Based upon the common meaning of &quot;shall&quot; as used in statutes, the clear directive of &sect; 1752 that actions brought pursuant to the act were to be governed exclusively by its own provisions, and the frustration of the act's purposes and effectiveness which would result from a contrary interpretation, the court concluded the use of the word &quot;shall&quot; in &sect; 1781(b) had to be given a mandatory meaning. Because petitioner met the criteria contained in &sect; 1782, the lower court did not have any discretion to deny class certification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued a peremptory writ of mandate compelling the lower court to vacate its order denying petitioner's motion for class certification and to grant the motion holding that the applicable statute established exclusive criteria for class certification in suits brought pursuant to the Consumers Legal Remedies Act, and that if the statutory criteria was satisfied, a trial court was under a duty to certify the class.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee, a member of the National Guard, took temporary military leaves of absence from his employment with defendant city. Defendant required that its employees, in order to keep both military and regular pay for periods of military leave, work on days that would otherwise have been days off. Plaintiff did so for most of the days of leave, but was not paid by defendant for a number of days which he did not make up and for which he did not turn over his military pay to defendant. Plaintiff sought a peremptory writ of mandate to require defendant to grant him military leave, and pay him, in accordance with Cal. Mil. &amp; Vet. Code &sect; 395.01. The trial court granted the writ, and defendant sought review. The court reversed and remanded. The court held that because &sect; 395.01 reflected a matter of statewide concern overriding city charters, it could constitutionally be applied to defendant. The court held, though, that the trial court had erred in failing to distinguish active military training, to which defendant could not apply its policy, from weekend drills, which the legislature had eliminated from the scope of &sect; 395.01.</SPAN></P>

Two of defendant suppliers were also convicted of selling laetrile.

The court thus held that &sect; 1701.1 violated defendant physician's and his patients' privacy rights under U.S. Const. XIV and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The court also held that the trial court erred in denying defendants' motion to suppress evidence obtained through a telephonic search warrant because the U.S. Customs agent who signed the magistrate's name to the warrant was not a &quot;peace officer&quot; under California law and was thus not authorized to do so under Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant importer filed an action against respondent county to recover ad valorem property taxes imposed on imported inventory owned by appellant. Respondent imposed the taxes on the basis of the United State Supreme Court's decision in Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U.S. 276, 46 L.Ed.2d 495 (1976), which held ad valorem taxes could be imposed upon imported goods. After Michelin, the legislature revised Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax.

Respondent challenged the constitutionality of the prospective effect of &sect; 226, and the trial court granted summary judgment for respondent. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the amendment to &sect; 226 was constitutional because the legislature could decide whether to allow prospective application of the legal precedent, and its decision to do so did not amount to an unconstitutional gift of public money because the primary purpose of the act was to benefit the public which might otherwise suffer from the unanticipated retroactive imposition of the tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police placed defendant in custody for being truant from school.

At the adjudication hearing, defendant objected to the confession's admission as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful arrest. This objection was overruled and defendant was charged and convicted of burglary. On appeal, defendant argued again that the confession should have been suppressed as a result of an illegal arrest. The court agreed and reversed. The court held that by reviewing the record it was clear that defendant was under arrest. Had police been acting under Cal. Educ. Code &sect;&sect; 12405, 12406, they had to adhere to statutory requirements, which did not occur. The court reviewed the record and found that no probable cause existed to arrest defendant and no intervening independent act of a free will or other circumstance served to attenuate the taint of the unconstitutional arrest and the resulting confession.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the real parties in interest on appeal, obtained a money judgment against defendant debtors, and defendants appealed. When plaintiffs served postjudgment interrogatories on defendants, defendants did not answer and plaintiffs filed a motion to compel answers. The trial court granted the motion and held that defendants would be barred from prosecuting their appeal if they did not answer the interrogatories within 60 days. The trial court then granted defendants' motion to reconsider but decided that the prior order stood. Defendants brought a mandate proceeding to compel the trial court to vacate the order. Defendants contended that Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 714.5, which authorized the use of written interrogatories for examining a judgment debtor concerning his property, put debtors at a disadvantage if they were not represented by counsel. The court found that &sect; 714.5 did not discriminate, but the section did not authorize the trial court to prohibit an appeal as a sanction for noncompliance. The court directed the trial court to vacate its orders forbidding the prosecution of defendants' appeal from the judgment in the action brought by plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 1170.2. The parties alleged that the UDSA was a legislative infringement upon the governor's power to commute sentences under Cal. Const. art. V, &sect; 8 and that it violated the separation of powers clause of the Cal. Const. art. III, &sect; 3. Respondent trial courts granted the real parties' motions, and petitioner state agencies sought review. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that retroactive application of the UDSA did not constitute an unconstitutional usurpation of the governor's commutation power. While &sect; 1170.2 has the effect of commutation in certain cases, an action outside the scope of the legislature's power, the shortening of existing prison terms by the UDSA was purely incidental to the main legislative purpose, and thus the UDSA was not unconstitutional.

The court determined that the purpose of &sect; 63.51was not to regulate ticket sales but limit business activity on public property dedicated to recreational use; as use of a city park is a municipal matter, Cal.

The trial court entered judgment in defendants' favor and declared the ordinance unconstitutional. Plaintiffs appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed. Applying a strict standard of review, the court held that the ordinance violated the equal protection clause of both the U.S. and California Constitutions, in that it approved an invidious discrimination against non-city voters in the county. The ordinance conferred upon voters within city limits the opportunity to vote on the location of an airport, but denied that same right to persons living outside the cities even though the location of an airport was a local environmental issue impacting voters within the city limits, as well as voters living outside the city limits.

The court held that, if adult persons are less than gravely disabled, there was no warrant for depriving them of liberty. The orders further violated petitioners' rights to freedom of religion and association under U.S. Const. amend I and Cal. Const. art. I because, while the state had a compelling interest in preventing fraud under the guise of religious belief and an interest in its citizens' health, in the absence of actions rendering the adult believer gravely disabled, the processes of the state could not be used to deprive the believer of freedom of action and subject to involuntary treatment.</SPAN></P>

Reasonable, narrowly drawn statutes could regulate the time, place, and manner of expression, but blanket prohibitions of expression were invalid as were overbroad statutes or those without clear standards. The judgment was affirmed because the ordinance was constitutional as it did not restrict amateur radio transmission throughout the city, but only in the residential zone and it did not prohibit all transmission even there.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of a peremptory writ of prohibition to enjoin the prosecution of a municipal zoning ordinance violation was affirmed because the restrictions placed upon appellant by the ordinance were reasonable. The ordinance that regulated radio and television antennas in a residential area was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The jury was instructed fully and properly on the elements of conspiracy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an injured minor, dived into a river from a trestle owned by defendant railroad and was rendered a quadriplegic. Plaintiff filed a complaint against defendant for negligence and willful misconduct. A jury rendered a verdict in favor of plaintiff. However, the trial court granted defendant's motion for a new trial on the issue of willful misconduct. On review, the court found that because it was well known that people dived off of the trestle, defendant was charged with notice of a dangerous condition which existed for a long time. However, the court also found that Cal. Civil Code &sect; 846 stated that an owner of an estate in real property owes no duty of care to keep the premises safe for use by others for a number of activities, including water sports. Thus, because defendant was the owner of the estate, and diving was a water sport, the court found that defendant could not be held liable for failure to use ordinary care in the keeping of the premises or in the matter of warning. Accordingly, the order granting a new trial on the willful misconduct issue was affirmed, and the negligence count was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the applicable statute provided that there was no duty of care to individuals, such as plaintiff, who came onto the land of another for the purpose of, among other things, water sports.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court held that defendants' demurrer was properly sustained. Although a taxpayer's action under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 526a addressed governmental action which would otherwise go unchallenged in the courts because of the standing requirement, a criminal defendant had standing and an immediate and plenary recourse within the judicial system with respect to any claimed violation of his constitutional rights. The claim against the county was also unconstitutional because it undermined the independence of the judiciary. Accordingly, the order of dismissal was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant assault victims were severely injured when a defendant violated probation and was released on bail.

Respondents' demurrer was sustained. On review, the court held that appellants failed to state a cause of action. No precedent existed to support a special relationship because it would impose liability for discretionary governmental acts or omissions granted unqualified immunity by the California Tort Claims Act, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 810 et seq. Respondents did not breach the mandatory duties imposed by Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 1203.10 and 1203.12 because the proximate cause element required to establish damages for a public entity's failure to discharge a mandatory duty was not satisfied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, Metropolitan Water District and Board Members, formulated a conflict of interest code pursuant to Cal.

Defendant revised portions of the code to prohibit plaintiffs from seeking review of any questionable financial disclosures by its general counsel on a case-by-case and interest-by-interest basis. Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of the revised code. The trial court denied plaintiffs' complaint. Plaintiff claimed on appeal that it was entitled to some form of individualized review for designated employees before they were required to divulge certain assets because Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 87302(b) allowed it to establish a procedure under which a designated employee could demonstrate that it was not reasonably foreseeable that a decision would have a material financial effect. The court rejected plaintiffs' claims because Section 87302(b) did not provide for a case-by-case evaluation of financial interests.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant land developers challenged a grant of summary judgment in favor of respondent city and dismissal of their action seeking to avoid payment of city municipal taxes affecting their housing projects. Appellants contended that the ordinances were unconstitutionally retroactive, that the taxes were discriminatory, and that the taxes exceeded the city's authority. The court found that the business license tax was a tax upon residential developers, which was measured by the number of dwelling units in construction or completed during the tax year. The tax upon appellants was not retroactive insofar as it was applied to some units which were substantially completed at the time of its enactment. Appellants' business was ongoing and the privilege of engaging in business as to those units substantially completed could validly be assessed in the form of a license tax. The court held that the city taxes challenged constituted a valid business license tax upon the ongoing business of residential construction and was prospective rather than retrospective in application, and that the ordinances declared their purpose as strictly that of raising revenue. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

While this case was pending, the United States Supreme Court in an unrelated case declared a similar statutory restriction on commercial speech to be unconstitutional. On this basis, the trial court dissolved the permanent injunction against appellant, but appellant sought review of other aspects of the trial court's judgment. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the permanent injunction was properly dissolved and the statutory prohibition on optical price advertising was unconstitutional. The court noted that appellant should be exonerated from the contempt order. The court held that appellant had no action against respondent association for damages resulting from the wrongful issuance of the injunction, and that respondent boards were protected by governmental immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff welfare recipient appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court of San Mateo County (California), which denied his petition for a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the payment of his claim for benefits without deductions for recoupment for overpayments based solely on county error, and denied his prayer for a declaration that the regulation authorizing the deduction was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff welfare recipient received welfare assistance from defendant county during a period when the value of his life insurance policy made him ineligible. Defendant discovered its error and instituted recoupment of those funds when plaintiff later reapplied and was granted benefits. Plaintiff filed a writ of mandate for recovery of his reduction in benefits and for a declaration that San Mateo County, Cal. General Assistance Manual &sect; 4-07, which authorized that deduction was invalid. He argued that the common law rule against recoupment of welfare benefits applied when no statute authorized it; that the regulation defendant relied on was invalid because it contravened Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 17000; and that defendant was estopped from seeking recoupment because its own error caused the overpayment. The trial court rejected plaintiff's contentions. Plaintiff sought review and the court affirmed the trial court's judgment stating that a regulation authorized recoupment and that because the reduction of benefits did not deny all necessary assistance, it was proper. Likewise, plaintiff's claim of estoppel was rejected because it required elements that were not shown to exist.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, stating that the rule defendant applied was properly adopted because the reduction of benefits did not deny all necessary assistance. The common law rule against recoupment of benefits was inapplicable citing the rule plaintiff relied on, and a failure to prove all of the elements of equitable estoppel barred its application.</SPAN></P>

The people appealed from an order entered in a habeas corpus proceeding by the trial court, which required the department of health to hold a limited hearing before officially revoking respondent's status as an outpatient. The court affirmed the trial court. It reasoned that the conditional liberty interest of the mental outpatient, like that of a parolee and that of an outpatient from the California Rehabilitation Center, included many of the core values of unqualified liberty and could not be terminated without due process of law. It held that minimal notice and hearing requirements applied in the case. It also held that insofar as the language of Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 7375 excluded the required notice and hearing, it failed to pass constitutional scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment awarding relocation costs to respondent, but struck the award of attorneys' fees because they were not authorized by the Act. The court held that exercise of the power of eminent domain was not a prerequisite to relocation benefits because the Act only required that the property be acquired for public use. Respondent was eligible for relocation costs because his move was the direct result of appellant's purchase of the property for public use. Respondent was eligible for benefits because its moving date was after the Act's effective date. Despite the Act's language that gave appellant sole authority to decide benefits, the court found respondent had a right to judicial review of the statute and its constitutionality as interpreted by appellant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents challenged a judgment of the trial court, which denied recovery against respondent city and its police officer for the wrongful death of their son. Appellant's child was shot and killed as he fled the scene after refusing to obey a command to halt by officers who sought to apprehend him as a burglary suspect. Appellants alleged that the officer acted negligently and unreasonably in firing to prevent decedent's escape. In a bench trial, the court found that the officer acted reasonably and with good cause. On appeal, the court reversed on the basis of a recent decision squarely on point, which was issued by another intermediate appellate court and which was denied a hearing by the state supreme court. That decision held that a police officer was held to the same standard as a private citizen in using deadly force to arrest a felony suspect. Thus, deadly force may not be used against a fleeing suspect absent circumstances that reasonably create a fear of death or serious bodily harm to the officer or to another. Applying this holding to the facts of this case, the court agreed with appellants that the evidence established liability as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed, relying on an appellate court opinion filed while this appeal was pending, holding that the facts as found by the trial court did not justify the use of deadly force to apprehend the suspect in the absence of evidence that the purported &quot;burglary in progress&quot; was committed under circumstances creating a fear of great bodily harm. Therefore, the use of deadly force was excessive as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California) that denied their petition for a writ of prohibition that sought to prohibit their prosecution by respondent municipal court for the violation of a municipal ordinance which outlawed soliciting without a license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners were being prosecuted for violating a municipal ordinance that required that anyone soliciting anything of value for a charitable purpose to obtain a permit from the city. The ordinance provided that a permit could be issued only if the city's public solicitation commission was satisfied that the purpose of the solicitation was worthy and not incompatible with public interest, that the applicant was of good character, and that the total expenses of the solicitation were not disproportionate to the sum to be collected. The ordinance also allowed the commission to waive some of the requirements when the applicant was known to be a bona fide charitable organization. Petitioners asserted that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the petition for writ of prohibition filed by petitioners that sought to prohibit their prosecution. On appeal, the court reversed and directed the trial court to issue a peremptory writ of prohibition. The court held that the ordinance was too vague to constitute a constitutionally permissive control of charitable solicitation because it failed to set forth definite, objective guidelines for the issuance of permits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court that denied the petition for writ of prohibition. The ordinance at issue was unconstitutional because it failed to set forth definite, objective guidelines for the issuance of permits. The court remanded the case with directions to issue a peremptory writ of prohibition commanding respondent municipal court to refrain from further proceedings and to dismiss the action against petitioners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers manufactured and delivered military weapons, equipment, and supplies for the federal government.

When the lower court entered an order pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 4702(a) denying that request, appellant sought review. The court found that aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) constituted welfare monies under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 10052, such that child support payments collected for AFDC purposes could not be paid directly to the child's mother. Appellant had assigned all of her accrued rights to the support of her minor child by respondent and therefore all of the child support payments had to be sent to the county department of public social services. Thus, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with bookmaking in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 337(a)(1), (2), (6). Defendant filed a motion to dismiss based on undisputed evidence that the police department and district attorney's office had a policy neither to arrest nor to prosecute bettors while they did arrest and prosecute bookmakers. The trial court found that because &sect; 337(6) made it a crime to place as well as to receive a bet, the prosecution of the bookmaker alone and not the bettor as well constituted unconstitutional discriminatory enforcement of the statute in violation of U. S. Const. amend. XIV and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7(a). Plaintiff state challenged the judgment. The court reversed, holding that the selective enforcement of &sect; 337 against bookmakers and not against bettors was not based on an invidious and unjustifiable standard. The court found that a distinction drawn on the basis of the difference in the kind of criminal conduct, even though of equal culpability under the law, was not suspect and that the selective enforcement of the statute against defendant was not a denial to her of constitutional equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff school district filed an action against defendant union based on its inducement of a strike by plaintiff's employees. Defendant demurred, and the trial court dismissed the complaint for failing to state a cause of action. The court reversed because it was unlawful for public school employees to strike. Defendant's free speech rights would not be violated because restraint on speech was not unconstitutional where the union was inducing an illegal strike. The court determined that defendant was not privileged to induce the breach of contract because the object of the action was unlawful. The complaint stated a cause of action for tortious inducement of breach of contract and based on defendant's direct liability. Conducting an unlawful strike was an independent tort and there was liability for aiding and abetting an intentional tort. The Educational Employment Relations Board had no jurisdiction over the action, because it occurred prior to the effective date of the board's jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner drivers were convicted of second offenses of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor (DWI), and they sought relief from the superior court to order defendant Department of Motor Vehicles and the municipal court to refrain from revoking their drivers licenses so long as they completed a rehabilitation program. The superior granted the relief, and thus, awarded them the benefits of Cal. Veh. Code &sect;&sect; 13201.5 and 13352.5 despite the fact that the county was not approved for the demonstration project. Defendant sought review, claiming that the limitation of the project to four counties was not a denial of equal protection. The court found that the project did not involve a suspect class or a fundamental interest and that the differential treatment had a rational relationship to the project's purpose. Thus, it did not violate equal protection. Furthermore, the project was not arbitrary and was neither a general law which did to have a uniform operation nor an invalid local or special statute. Accordingly, the court held that the trial court erred in concluding petitioners were entitled to the project's benefit, and the judgments were reversed.</SPAN></P>
