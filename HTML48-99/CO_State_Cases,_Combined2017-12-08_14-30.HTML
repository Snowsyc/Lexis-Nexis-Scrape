</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff appealed an order from the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado), which before trial, ruled that the plaintiff was limited to a maximum recovery of $ 10,000 damages for personal injuries under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-10-2 (repealed 1971), even though the jury found in favor of the plaintiff against defendant city in excess of that limitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff filed an action against the city and one of its police officers, alleging that she was injured in a car accident caused by the officer's negligent operation of a patrol car while he was responding to an emergency. Before trial, the trial court had ruled that the plaintiff was limited to a maximum recovery of $ 10,000 damages for personal injuries under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-10-2 (repealed 1971). Plaintiff made a timely objection and, after a jury returned a verdict in her favor, appealed the trial court's limitation of damages.On appeal,the court affirmed the judgment on the issue of liability, but reversed on the issue of damages, concluding that both the city's charter as well as the state's statute partially discarded the doctrine of governmental immunity. And, although there was a monetary limitation in &sect; 13-10-2, nowhere in the Denver charter was there a monetary limitation. The court concluded that governmental immunity for tortious acts of municipal police officers was a matter of both statewide and local concern and, in the absence of conflict with &sect; 13-10-2, a home-rule city may extend greater benefits to persons injured by the tortious acts of its officers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment as to liability and reversed as to damages, and the cause was remanded to the district court, with directions to hold a trial on the issue of damages only, concluding that, because there was no conflict between the statute and the city's charter provisions, the latter controlled and the $ 10,000 limit of the statute was not applicable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner employee appealed an order of the Industrial Commission of Colorado, which affirmed a referee's award of reduced and delayed benefits to the employee in the employee's action in which he sought unemployment benefits under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-74-101 (Supp. 1976).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was terminated by respondent employer for alleged tardiness, absenteeism, and his conduct at work. He filed a claim for unemployment benefits under &sect; 8-74-101, and the referee found that the employee's recent period of absenteeism, tardiness, and conduct were the reasons for his separation from full-time work and that the employee was responsible for his separation. Pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-73-108(6) (Supp. 1976), the referee awarded reduced benefits and delayed the benefits for six weeks. The Commission affirmed. The employee appealed, contending that &sect; 8-73-108(6) was unconstitutionally vague because it conferred unfettered discretion upon the Commission to utilize the subsection as it saw fit, regardless of the facts of the case. The court held that the legislature had the power to delegate to the Commission discretion to grant or deny unemployment benefits. The court held further that there was substantial evidence to support the factual determination of the referee and its subsequent affirmance by the Commission. The court held that under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-74-107(4) (Supp. 1976), those findings were conclusive, even if the evidence was conflicting.</SPAN></P>

The District Court of Routt County (Colorado) held that the sign owners lacked standing under the First Amendment and ruled for the city. The sign owners sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sign code, which was adopted as part of the city's general zoning ordinance, provided that the sign owners and others could no longer display signs that extended more than three feet into or over public property, and that all such non-conforming signs were to be terminated. In bringing their action for declaratory judgment, the sign owners claimed that the sign code violated the First Amendment. The trial court determined that the sign owners lacked standing to pursue their First Amendment claims, and found in favor of the city. Upon review, while the court held that the sign owners had standing to sue, reversal was not necessary because the outcome for the city was correct. The court held that the city's sign code did not violate the First Amendment because the regulation of the conduct was within the city's constitutional power, the regulation furthered an important or substantial governmental interest, namely to promote the public safety and general welfare, the city's interest was unrelated to the suppression of free expressions, and the incidental restriction on the alleged First Amendment freedoms was no greater than was essential to the furtherance of its interest.</SPAN></P>

The action was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lower court concluded that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that self-defense was an affirmative defense to reckless manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. The affirmative defense instruction on self-defense was given on the crimes of second-degree murder and criminally negligent homicide. But the trial court did not instruct the jury that self-defense was an affirmative defense to reckless manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide. On appeal, the court reasoned that where, as here, an element of the crime charged was that defendant acted in a reckless or criminally negligent manner, and the trial court properly instructed the jury as to each element, no error resulted from the trial court's failure to give a self-defense instruction. The court reasoned that the affirmative defense was deleted based upon the reasoning that if justification or exemption were present, defendant would not have been acting recklessly, therefore, if the jury was able to find that defendant acted recklessly, they precluded any finding of affirmative defense.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and held that it was within the legislature's power to provide harsher penalties for acts it believed to have greater social consequences.

The individual contacted the police, and defendants were eventually charged with, and found guilty of, criminal extortion and conspiracy to commit criminal extortion. On appeal, the court affirmed, first concluding that defendants did not have standing to pursue their claim that the criminal extortion statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev.

The individuals argued that &sect; 18-9-106(1)(c) was unconstitutionally vague because the word unreasonable was not specific enough to have been commonly understood and the culpable mental state required was unclear. The court held that the statute was not vague because it did enable men of ordinary intelligence to have comprehended what conduct was forbidden. The state's interest in &sect; 18-9-106(1)(c) was to have afforded the captive audience protection from unreasonable intrusions that met their recognizable privacy interests. The court determined that the statute, when properly construed, was consisted with U.S. Const. amend. I, and therefore the statute was not overly broad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant City of Colorado Springs challenged the decision of the District Court of El Paso County (Colorado), which granted appellee telephone company's motion for summary judgment and declared the city's occupation tax ordinance, Colorado Springs, Colo. Ordinance No. 3590 to be unconstitutional in a declaratory judgment action brought by the telephone company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city enacted Colorado Springs, Colo. Ordinance No. 3590, through which it imposed a utility occupation tax upon gross revenues received by public utilities from their operations within the city. Following the enactment of the ordinance, the court held that a municipal ordinance that assessed an occupation tax on the basis of total gross revenues derived from sales was an unconstitutional levy of an income tax. The telephone company then filed a lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was unconstitutional and invalid. The company brought a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. The city appealed. The court affirmed because the occupation tax was in reality an invalid income tax imposed by the city on the company. The tax was based upon gross revenues derived from local telephone services, which was pegged to financial success and sales. Therefore, it was not a tax on the privilege of doing business, but rather was an income tax. Because only the state could impose income taxes, the city exceeded its municipal powers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue before the court was the constitutionality of &sect; 971.2-14. Defendant contended on appeal that the ordinance violated the due process clause of Colo. Const. art. II, &sect;25 by creating an irrational conclusive presumption. The court agreed and held that the ordinance was invalid because it made a conclusive presumption that all who massaged persons of the opposite sex engaged in illicit sexual activity. For such a presumption to have been constitutionally valid, the presumption must in fact have been reasonable. Even though there was a legitimate purpose for the legislation, such legislation failed because there was no reasonable factual basis for the enactment. The court held that there was no evidence on the record from which a conclusion was possible that all persons who massaged a person of the opposite sex committed an illicit sexual act. The ordinance precluded everyone, whether moral or immoral, from administering for compensation massages to persons of the opposite sex and provided no opportunity for anyone to conduct such as a legitimate business.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff mother filed an action for wrongful death of her five-year-old child in which judgment was asked for $ 2,300,798.93 plus costs, interest, and attorney's fees. The District Court of Arapahoe County (Colorado) granted a motion striking the portions of the mother's complaint, which alleged grounds for a recovery exceeding $ 45,000. The order was made a final judgment. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother's principal argument involved her equal protection claim. She contended that the division into two classes of plaintiffs, one of which was subject to a $ 45,000 limitation on recovery while the other was not, was a denial of equal protection. In considering the equal protection claim, the court looked first to the type of classification being made. Clearly, the classification here was not a &quot;suspect&quot; one because it did not single out religious, racial, or other discrete and insular minorities. The distinction was between a class consisting of surviving spouses, minor children, and dependent parents, and a class of all other people who were entitled to recover under the wrongful death act. The &quot;discriminated against&quot; class could consist of such diverse people as an adult child and a nondependent parent. The court concluded that the legislation was not directed at any particular group of people in a &quot;suspect&quot; class. The court held that the classification may have rationally furthered any legitimate state interest. The mother did not meet her burden of showing that the scheme was not rationally conceived to further a legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>

The trial court's judgment was in favor of appellees, two railroad companies, which owned tracks at the crossing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The PUC ordered the grade crossing closed in order to promote public safety. A road crossed railroad tracks owned by the railroad companies and an additional railroad company. After the crossing was closed, the tracks owned by the third railroad company were removed. The PUC later ordered the reopening of the crossing for the convenience and safety of the public and for the reinstallation of safety devices. The PUC required the railroad companies to maintain the devices and to pay 10 percent of their installation cost. The court found that the PUC order was just and reasonable and that the evidence presented before the PUC supported the order. The district court was required to exercise an independent judgment on the law and the facts under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-6-115(2). The court found that the trial court exceeded its reviewing powers and substituted its judgment for that of the PUC. Because the decision to reopen the crossing was made properly and was supported by the evidence, it was not unconstitutional to require the railroads to pay for 10 percent of the cost of installing safety devices at the crossing.</SPAN></P>

Defendant threatened the woman with a knife but assured her that he would not hurt her if she helped him get out of town. The two eventually drove to Wyoming. Defendant twice forced the woman to stop the car and have sexual intercourse with him, causing her severe pain and an eventual kidney infection. The woman eventually managed to escape. A prior federal prosecution resulted in defendant's conviction based on a plea bargain. The court disagreed with defendant's contention that the first-degree kidnapping statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-301 (1973), was unconstitutionally vague, ambiguous, and overbroad. Also, the court found that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-302 (1973) could not have been construed to bar separate prosecutions for different state and federal offenses arising out of the same series of transactions. The evidence of sexual acts that occurred in Wyoming was admissible because it was relevant to the question whether the kidnapping was a Class one or a Class two felony. There was sufficient evidence to support the convictions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the punishment for causing a serious bodily injury under the vehicular assault statute was more severe than that which could be imposed under the criminally negligent homicide statute where the death of another was involved and that the vehicular felony assault statute was thus unconstitutional. The court held that it was the Colorado Legislature's province to create and define crimes and to provide penalties for them, subject to the constitutional limitations that a criminal statute was to be neither arbitrary nor unreasonable in its classification or in its penal provisions, and that there had to be a reasonable relationship to the public purpose to be achieved.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county commissioners contended on appeal that the Act was so replete with contradictions, inconsistencies, and irreconcilable conflicts that it was unconstitutionally vague and incapable of judicial interpretation without resort to judicial legislation. The court held that only when legislation was so vague, indefinite and uncertain that courts were unable to determine, with reasonable certainty, what the legislature intended, or so incomplete and inconsistent in its provisions that it could not be executed, would it be struck down as unconstitutionally vague. The court found that the general assembly clearly intended to distinguish between petitions for annexation signed by 100 per cent of the owners of the land proposed for annexation, and petitions signed by a lesser number, by enacting Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-8-107(1)(g) (1973). The court construed the legislative limitation to apply to the entire statute and not merely to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-8-107 (1973), found that this construction removed the inconsistencies suggested by the county commissioners, and concluded that notice and hearing were not required when 100 per cent of the landowners signed the annexation petition.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that equal protection of the law was a guarantee of like treatment of all those who were similarly situated. Classification of persons under the criminal law must be under legislation that was reasonable and not arbitrary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The witness had observed a ruckus and was listed as a potential witness on a summons and complaint pending against defendant. The witness testified that defendant told him that if he showed up in court he would be taken care of. On appeal from conviction, defendant contended that &sect; 18-8-604(c) was intended to have dealt with inducing someone not to appear at all, while &sect; 18-8-604(a) was intended to have dealt only with deceptive testimony. The court rejected this contention, holding that defendant's actions came within the plain language of &sect; 18-8-604(a). The court reasoned that it was clear that defendant attempted to influence the witness to withhold testimony, and it was hardly a mitigating factor that his goal was the withholding of all testimony, not just portions thereof. The court further rejected defendant's contention that because the witness was not subpoenaed at the time of the contact, withholding testimony could not have been unlawful. The court reasoned that the statute expressly forbid intimidation, not only of a witness, but also of one whom the accused believed was to have been called as a witness in the future.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the district court erred in denying his motions for judgment of acquittal. From the court's review of the record, the court found ample evidence to support the jury verdicts and the trial court properly denied defendant's motions for judgment of acquittal. The court concluded that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying a severance of offenses. Although the felony menacing occurred on a different day than that of the knife offenses, the knife was seized from defendant as a result of his arrest for the earlier felony menacing. The knife itself was very similar to the knife described by the victim of the attack. Thus, the knife was evidence also relevant to the felony menacing charge. Based on these articulable facts and circumstances, the officer had probable cause to arrest defendant. Once the officer had made a valid arrest, a full search of defendant was permissible. The fact that the two witnesses' previous physical descriptions of the assailant differed in some respects raised an issue that was properly argued to the jury for its consideration in weighing the identification testimony. Thus, the court affirmed the judgment of convictions.</SPAN></P>

A search of defendant produced a slip of paper with the mother's phone number and a key to the motel where the body was eventually found. The victim's brother gave police the location of a motel room to which he said defendant had access; defendant also gave the same location to police in a statement that was later suppressed.. On appeal from his convictions, defendant argued that the trial court erred when it refused to suppress some evidence. The court affirmed the convictions, holding that the trial court correctly found that the evidence discovered at the motel, that is, the body of the victim, had a source independent of defendant's unlawfully obtained statement. The motel key was taken in a lawful warrantless search incident to defendant's arrest; the warrantless search was valid because the officer had probable cause to arrest.</SPAN></P>

The heirs moved to vacate the order admitting the will to probate. The probate court denied the motion, finding that the 30-day statute of limitations of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-12-413 (1973) barred their motion. The heirs again petitioned to vacate the order based upon a &quot;lost&quot; will and the probate court again ruled against them. The heirs alleged that they were deprived of property without due process of law because of insufficient notice and lack of an opportunity for a hearing. The court affirmed, holding that notice was sent to the heirs, as required by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-12-403(1)(b) (1973), and at the hearing, all remained silent. Furthermore, the heirs could not take advantage the &quot;lost will&quot; exemption provided by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-12-412(1)(a) (1973) because they were aware of the prior will at the time of the probate order. Even if the heirs did fall within the exemption, they were still barred by the statute of limitations of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-12-412(1)(c) (1973) because the motion was filed more than one year after the order was issued.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not deny the state the power to create distinct classes between &quot;protected persons&quot; and those who had legal capacity to manage their own affairs because the classifications were based on reasonable differences and were not arbitrary. The trial court exercised sound discretion in the matter because it considered everything having a legitimate bearing on the election.

Stat. &sect; 14-10-131(2) (1973), which governed the modification of child custody orders, was unconstitutional. The court also rejected the father's contention that a change of custody was required under the provisions of the Colorado Children's Code, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-1-101 et seq. (1973). Further, the court found that the record supported the trial court's finding that there had been no significant change in circumstances. The court noted that the father had a passive aggressive antisocial personality disorder, that he had demonstrated that he had no respect for any other person's opinion or the orders of trial court as to the needs of the child, that he had threatened to do physical harm to anyone who interfered with the carrying out of his opinions and actions, and that the child risked psychological harm if he was placed with the father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver accumulated 13 points against her driver's license for violation of Colo. Rev.

The district court reversed, ruling that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-2-123(11)&nbsp;unconstitutionally delegated legislative power and that the portion of the statute dealing with driver's license suspension was not severable from the invalid portion. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that because the overall statutory scheme, of which the probationary license provision was a part, provided sufficient general standards to guide its application, and contained adequate safeguards against administrative abuse, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-2-123(11) was not on its face an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. Although the court agreed with the finding of constitutional infirmities in the application of Colo. Rev.

The court reversed because it found that the words &quot;final&quot; and &quot;final and conclusive&quot; in the city code and statute merely determined the point of the administrative finality. The courts remained able to determine the validity of the &quot;final&quot; administrative orders.

The court found that &quot;serious&quot; bodily injury was defined in Colo. Rev. Stat. 18-1-901(c((p) (1973) and, therefore, the distinction being clear, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-202, was not constitutionally vague. Defendant also contended that &sect; 18-3-202 violated his equal protection rights based upon an argument that &sect; 18-3-202 and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-203, which defined second-degree assault, were pragmatically the same.

The court held that the testimony was not hearsay because the evidence was not offered to prove the truth of the facts asserted. The court held that cautionary instructions were not necessary because such instructions were mandated only when requested by defense counsel and where misconduct was of a &quot;similar nature&quot; to the offense charged, and was &quot;wholly independent&quot; of the transaction on trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The question presented was whether the statute of limitations, Colo. Rev.

The alleged negligence of respondent physician consisted of the failure to discover a cancerous growth in the husband's wife's chest when he examined her X-rays. The summons and amended complaint were served within two years of the date of death, but more than two years after the discovery of the cancer. The trial court granted the physician's motion for summary judgment on the ground that the claim for wrongful death against him was barred by the statute of limitations. The court of appeals affirmed. The court also affirmed. The injury or damage from the physician's alleged negligence was known or should have been known when the deceased underwent surgery and the doctors discovered large areas of cancerous tissue in her chest. It was not until more than two years after the date of discovery of the alleged negligence that the physician was served with a summons. Further, it was difficult to see how the language of the statute could be interpreted to mean anything other than what it said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals affirming the grant of summary judgment for the physician on the basis that the cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

The poker clubs were found to have been engaged in professional gambling as defined by statute. It was further found that such activities constituted a public nuisance under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-13-303(1) (1973).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The poker clubs encouraged people to come to their club to play poker, for which the poker clubs charged an hourly fee. The court reasoned that because it was not alleged that the poker clubs participated in gambling, the issue was whether the poker clubs aided or induced others to engage in gambling with the intent to derive a profit. The poker clubs conceded that they engaged in their activities to make a profit. The poker clubs contended that within the context of the gambling statute the general definition of &quot;to aid&quot; was inapplicable and that the term meant only an active participation in, or profiting from, the gambling process itself. The court rejected this contention, holding that there was no reason why the general statutory definition of &quot;to aid&quot; should not have applied to the gambling statute. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that applying the general statutory definition of &quot;to aid&quot; to the facts, it was clear that the poker clubs' activity fell directly within that definition. The poker clubs knowingly and for profit furnished a place for the purposes of gambling as well as all the necessary facilities, including poker tables, chairs, cards, and change.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a jury of second-degree burglary and theft of less than fifty dollars. At trial, the State called as a witness an individual who had been arrested with defendant. He claimed that he was unable to remember whether defendant had suggested the burglary or had entered the store, and he could not recall giving a statement to a police officer. The officer then testified that the witness had made a statement to him regarding defendant's involvement in the burglary. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that the district court did not err in allowing the State to impeach its own witness with prior inconsistent statements because once the statutory foundation had been laid, the witness's prior inconsistent statements became admissible without a showing of surprise or hostility. The court held that because the witness was available for cross-examination, his actual or feigned memory loss regarding the prior inconsistent statements did not violate defendant's confrontation right. The court held also that under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-603 (1973), because defendant was charged as a principal, he could be tried and convicted as a complicitor.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that there was no conflict or inconsistency between Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-8-103(3) (1973) and the election code. The court noted that while the strict scrutiny standard normally applied to alleged deprivations of the right to vote, an exception existed for special improvement districts in which voters were required to have paid a tax on real property within the district when the district was of relatively limited authority and purpose and had a disproportionate effect on landowners.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was involved in an altercation with another patron at a nightclub. On appeal, the court first ruled that the evidence supported the conclusion that defendant inflicted the damaging blow to the victim at a time when the fighting had ceased. That fact and the other evidence presented was sufficient to support a verdict of guilt. Defendant argued, however, that the first-degree assault statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-202(1)(b) (1973), was unconstitutional because it imposed a higher penalty for essentially the same conduct proscribed by the second-degree assault statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-203(1)(a). The court found that the two assault statutes defined the type of injury sustained by the victim in substantially identical terms. The difference between &quot;permanent&quot; disablement and &quot;protracted loss or impairment&quot; was not sufficiently apparent to be intelligently and uniformly applied. Therefore, the first-degree assault statute was unconstitutional as violative of the right to equal protection of the laws.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff landowners sought to quiet title and damages for trespass on certain real estate. Before trial, the District Court of Chaffee County (Colorado) granted the landowners a preliminary injunction to remove a fence erected by defendant adjacent neighbors. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the landowners and the neighbors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners filed suit to quiet title to certain real estate and to obtain damages for trespass and conspiracy to commit trespass. After trial, a special verdict was returned finding that it was the intention of the landowners' predecessors in interest to convey to them all of the property to the center line of the creek. Based upon the special findings, the trial court directed a judgment against the neighbors and a survey engineer for trespass and instructed the jury on the issues of damages and conspiracy. Damages were awarded, title was quieted in the landowners, and $ 5,000 was awarded for attorneys' fees under Colorado's Forcible Entry and Detainer Statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-40-123 (1973). On appeal, the court held the trial court improperly construed the deed, allowing parol evidence to be introduced when the deed language was unambiguous. However, the court held that there was insufficient evidence of a conspiracy, and ordered those charges to be dismissed. Last, the court held that the Forcible Entry and Detainer Statute to be unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The People challenged the decision of the District Court, Twenty-first Judicial District (Colorado), which dismissed an information against defendant for theft by receiving, a violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-410 (1976). The information was dismissed on the ground that the statute was vague and overbroad, and thus unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An undercover police officer approached defendant, said he had recently stolen a pistol, and offered to sell it. Defendant bought the pistol and was later arrested. In fact, the pistol was not stolen. The information charged that defendant purchased the pistol, believing it to have been stolen property. On appeal, the People contended that theft by receiving included property not actually stolen. The court reasoned that unlike its predecessor, &sect; 18-4-410 required knowledge or belief that the property was stolen. The court held that the clear import of this change was to broaden the crime of theft by receiving to include the purchase of property, which the purchaser believed was stolen. Further, there was no inconsistency between the element of belief that the goods were stolen and the element of intent to permanently deprive the lawful owner of the use of the thing of value. Although mistaken as to his identity, an accused could still intend to deprive the lawful owner of his property. Thus, the court concluded that it was no defense to prosecution for theft by receiving that defendant mistakenly believed the goods were stolen.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-12-108 (1973), under which the prosecution was brought, was unconstitutional as applied in light of the right to keep and bear arms contained in Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's wife had testified that the firearms were kept by her and defendant for her protection. The State contended on appeal that the issue of defendant's purpose in keeping the firearms should not have been raised in a motion to dismiss. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause. The court stated that despite the flat prohibition contained in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-12-108 (1973), the specific limitations of Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 13 had to be superimposed on the statute's otherwise valid language. The court stated that a defendant in such a case who presented competent evidence showing that his purpose in possessing weapons was the defense of his home, person, and property thereby raised an affirmative defense. The court observed that the question of defendant's purpose in keeping the weapons was for the fact finder to determine at trial, noting that the burden of proof did not shift and that defendant need only raise in the fact finders' minds a reasonable doubt regarding his guilt. The court stated that it was error for the trial court to dismiss the proceedings without a trial on the issue of defendant's purpose in possessing firearms.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant firefighters' association challenged a ruling of the District Court of Adams County (Colorado) in a declaratory judgment action brought by respondent City. The trial court held that binding arbitration was beyond the scope of the City's legislative power under Colo. Const. art. XX, &sect; 6; that an amendment to the City's charter was unconstitutional; and that submission by the City to arbitration was an unlawful delegation of power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The City was a home rule city and the amendment was adopted by a majority vote of the City's qualified electors. The amendment granted to the City's firefighters the rights to bargain collectively and to have unresolved issues submitted to arbitration. After the article was adopted, the City and the firefighters entered into an agreement concerning wages, hours, working conditions and other incidents of employment. The following year, the parties reached an impasse on the question of wages and educational incentives. The firefighters sought to proceed to arbitration but the City was unwilling to join them and brought this declaratory judgment action. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court in part and held that the charter amendment was not unconstitutional in providing for collective bargaining. The court agreed with the trial court that the binding arbitration provision of the amendment was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, acting as a local liquor licensing authority, summarily suspended the licensee's liquor license for violation of the state liquor code. Appellants sent the licensee a notice, scheduling a public hearing on the alleged violations nine days later. The notice informed the licensee of the hearing process and of its rights to present its own evidence, et cetera. The notice also said that the hearing officer had authority to change the date or time of the hearing at either party's request. The licensee did not request a different hearing date. Appellants' action was prompted by reports that the licensee had staged nude entertainment at its premises. The court found that, under the facts of the case, it could not be said that the procedure provided by appellants denied the licensee due process. Thus, the court held &sect; 12-47-110 constitutional as applied to the licensee.

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded with directions to reinstate the charges, concluding that, however inequitable the trial judge thought Colo. Rev.

Specifically, defendants were charged with feloniously selling auto parts from autos that were the property of others. The statute was aimed at those who aided thieves in receiving and disposing of stolen automobiles and stolen auto parts. One defendant argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it authorized a felony conviction without fixing a value for the stolen merchandise. The trial court ruled that &sect; 42-5-102 denied equal protection of the laws. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court stated that &sect; 42-5-102 constituted a reasonable classification and that prosecutions under &sect; 42-5-102 were authorized irrespective of the general theft statutes. The court determined that there was no need to fix a value of the particular property involved because the purpose of the statute was to curb trafficking of stolen automobiles and parts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The manager filed an action, challenging the constitutionality of a city obscenity ordinance, Denver, Colo., Municipal Code 823. The trial court found that the ordinance was constitutionally defective on the basis that the city lacked authority to enact the ordinance and that the ordinance conflicted with subsequent legislative authorization. The court affirmed. The court held that although the city was a home rule city and thus given significant powers to control local matters, the definition and regulation of obscenity was a matter of statewide concern and therefore, local power was preempted. The court found that under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-7-101(1) (Cum. Supp. 1976), the state general assembly determined that statewide standards for the regulation of obscenity had to be uniform. The court found that the ordinance conflicted with the legislative grant of power because the ordinance attempted to control the printed or written words, the attempted to regulate obscenity as to minors, defined obscenity without regard to statewide community standards, contained an overly broad definition of obscenity, and a broader mens rea element that the state statute.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that the ordinance constituted a reasonable regulation concerning health and welfare, and the city did not act arbitrarily or capriciously. The ordinance had a fair relation to the protection of human life and the protection of public convenience and welfare. Because the ordinance bore a rational relation to a proper objective, there was no deprivation of property in violation of due process. Nor was there a condemnation because the commission certificates did not give the garbage collectors an exclusive right to collect trash. Further, the ordinance did not unconstitutionally delegate authority over trash disposal to the city, as opposed to the commission. The constitutional provision granting the commission authority over trash disposal reserved the police powers to the city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the first-degree murder statute was unconstitutional in that it provided greater penalties than those provided in the reckless manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide statutes without differentiating the conduct defined as first-degree murder from that defined as reckless manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide. The standards of culpability in the two statutes were distinct enough to be intelligently understood and applied. Therefore, defendant was not denied equal protection of the law. The evidence was sufficient to support the verdict of first-degree murder. The trial court properly allowed a police officer to testify from his notes. There was no abuse of discretion in the trial court's refusal to allow the witness' notes into evidence. The trial court did not err in allowing defendant's former girl friend, a prosecution witness, to testify concerning her fear of defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the standards in &sect; 19-1-104(4)(a) for certifying a child for criminal proceedings in district court were impermissibly vague and overbroad and did not give fair notice of the prohibited conduct and, therefore, the transfer procedure denied him due process of law and was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the judiciary, and that the district court committed reversible error in rejecting his tendered instruction that aggravated robbery required specific intent to deprive an owner of the use or benefit of his property. The court found that &sect; 19-1-104(4)(a) was not unconstitutional as denying due process of law. Section 19-1-104(4)(a) concerned transfer hearings and the prerequisites to a transfer order and due process standards of fair notice did not apply to juvenile court transfer provisions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners owned contiguous tracts of land that were bisected by a north-south highway. They desired to swap parts of their lands so that the resulting tracts would lie wholly on one side of the highway or the other. The Board required a metes and bounds survey for this purpose, but the landowners did not want to pay for the survey, and provided plats and other descriptions of the tracts instead. In affirming the judgment that denied the landowners' request, the court confirmed the constitutionality of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30-28-110(4)(a) (1973), which required Board approval for the transfer. The court held that the landowners failed to prove that the statute was not reasonably related to a legitimate government interest, or that its classification scheme, which was based on the size of the property sought to be transferred, denied the landowners equal protection of the law. The court held that the metes and bounds survey requirement was reasonable.

Defendant appealed. At issue on appeal was whether either of the elements of belief that an article was stolen or having a reasonable cause so to believe passed constitutional muster. On appeal, the court remanded for additional findings, holding that: (1) that portion of &sect; 18-4-410(1), (2) which defined the mental state as including &quot;having reasonable cause to believe&quot; was unconstitutional by reason of overbreadth; and (2) if defendant received a thing of value believing it to have been stolen and with the specific intent to deprive the lawful owner of the article permanently, his conviction of theft did not violate the constitution.

For his crimes, he was sentenced to not less than 40 or more than 50 years in prison.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee Colorado Department of Health adopted regulations to prohibit importation of pets for resale from states whose licensing laws and regulations for commercial pet dealers were not as stringent as those of Colorado, but they exempted persons who imported pets not for resale. The District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado) upheld the regulations. Appellant commercial pet importers challenged the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The importers first claimed that the regulations were in excess of the state's police power. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment upholding the regulations. The court found that the regulations were adopted to protect the public health by preventing the unregulated importation of domestic animals. The regulation was reasonably designed to further the state objective of protecting the public from animals that carried disease by defining certain standards for maintenance of the animals. By subjecting all pet importers to health standards at least as strict as those imposed upon in-state suppliers, the regulations insured that a minimal level of health standards regarding pets in intrastate commerce would exist. The importers also argued that because those importing pets for personal use were exempted, the regulations violated equal protection. The court found that no suspect category or fundamental right was implicated and that the distinction had a reasonable basis and served a legitimate state goal. The exemptions for &quot;non-commercial&quot; importers were based upon a determination that pets distributed through commercial channels posed the greatest health hazard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury found defendant guilty of rape, deviate sexual intercourse, and menacing and, following his convictions, he was sentenced as a habitual criminal. On appeal, defendant first argued that the trial court erred in joining a charge of forcible rape with an unrelated deviate sexual intercourse charge committed on a different female for purposes of trial on the sanity issue. The record indicated that the trial court submitted separate verdict forms to the jury for each incident and instructed the jury that it was to reach separate verdicts with regard to the two incidents. Defendant did not object to the trial of the two sanity issues in the same proceeding. The court affirmed, holding that the law in Colorado that mandated a jury decide the issue of sanity from one that decided the trial on the merits, &sect; 16-8-104 (1973), contemplated the admission of evidence of other crimes in the trial on insanity. The court then noted that the provision for sentencing under the habitual criminal statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-13-101(1) (1976 Supp.), had been recently amended, thus, the case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners' sole contention was that, due to constitutional and statutory requirements of equality and uniformity of taxation, the county assessor's revaluation of the relevant property was invalid. They argued that, since other similarly situated property was not revalued until a later time, the early revaluation of their property was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that Colorado had neither constitutional nor statutory requirements that all taxable property be revalued before such revaluations were entered on the tax rolls. Rather, the constitutional mandate was that the methods and regulations for assessment had to secure just and equalized valuations for assessments. The property owners made no allegation of fraud or intentional or systematic discrimination. On the contrary, the scheme employed by the county assessor was designed to implement the constitutional and statutory mandates of substantial uniformity. The temporary existence of differences in valuations which resulted from a systematic and definite revaluation plan did not constitute discrimination of a nature violative of constitutional and statutory uniformity and equality requirements.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that the residence of a married couple and six mentally retarded children constituted a family within Broomfield, Colo., Ordinance No. 149, art. 26, &sect; 2(11).  Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with selling cocaine, a narcotic drug. The prosecution's expert admitted at trial that the test which he performed did not indicate whether the substance was a natural extract of the coca leaf or synthetically produced. Following conviction, defendant appealed, raising two issues: (1) whether the substance that he sold was the alleged narcotic drug &quot;cocaine&quot; within the meaning of the Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-22-301(16) (1973); and (2) whether the statute was defective because of an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that: (1) a matter of law, the statutory prohibition under the state statute encompassed synthetically produced forms of cocaine as well as natural cocaine; (2) defendant's challenge to the statute's constitutionality failed because defendant's conduct was clearly proscribed by the statute at the time it was originally enacted and there was no fundamental right that was conceivably chilled by the statute. The court noted that &quot;pseudococaine&quot; fell within the prohibition of the Federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, upon which the state statute relied for definitions.</SPAN></P>

The lower court reversed defendant's conviction, holding that the actions of the arresting officers violated defendant's U.S. Const. amend. IV rights. The lower court reasoned that by placing his hand in defendant's pocket, the officer exceeded the scope of a proper investigatory frisk. The state appealed and the court reversed the judgment and remanded with directions to reinstate the conviction. The court held that there was a legitimate basis for initially confronting defendant because the officers needed to serve the search warrant. The court held that the officers had abundant background information on defendant's activities and there was undisputed testimony by one officer that he was familiar with defendant's rap sheet, which included prior charges of assault with a deadly weapon. The court held that the officers' protective response in pulling defendant's hand out of his pocket and then reaching into it was also not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee motor home purchaser bought his vehicle out of state. The department required the purchaser to pay tax on the total asking price. The Department stated that trade-in value would be subtracted from total purchase price for use tax purposes but only if that trade-in were made in Colorado to a Colorado retailer. The purchaser paid the tax under protest. The trial court held that the denial of the tax credit by the Colorado taxing authorities was unconstitutional when such a credit was allowed when the vehicle was purchased in Colorado. The Department sought review. On review, the court held that such unequal treatment was discriminatory and constituted an impermissible burden on interstate commerce under the U.S. Const. art.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-47-101 et seq. (1973), declared Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-47-128 (1973) to be facially unconstitutional by reason of its search and forfeiture of property provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were charged with violation of, and conspiracy to violate, provisions of the Liquor Code. The information was filed after officers entered a club pursuant to a search warrant and seized liquor, suspected narcotics, and firearms. In addition, the officers made a warrantless seizure of booths, chairs, furniture, bar stools, curtains, card tables, pool cues, and other items of personal property in the club. Defendants made a pre-trial motion to suppress evidence. The parties furnished the trial court with a stipulation as to the facts and issues. The trial court held the statute facially unconstitutional. The People appealed, phrasing the issue as: Whether Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-47-128 (1973), which authorized warrantless search and seizure under certain circumstances, was constitutional. Upon consideration, the court answered the question in the affirmative and affirmed the district court's order. According to court, the statute unconstitutionally circumvented the requirement of a finding of probable cause by a judicial officer prior to issuance of a search warrant. U.S. Const. amend. XXI did not alter U.S. Const. amend. IV to authorize a warrantless search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following hearing on the petition for writ of habeas corpus, the trial court made the writ absolute on the ground, expressed sua sponte, that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-8-103(2) was unconstitutional. The statute allowed the trial court to conduct a sanity investigation because defense counsel felt it was warranted but defendant refused to assert the defense. The trial court ordered that defendant be remanded to the custody of the sheriff for further proceedings under the criminal information or for initiation of civil commitment proceedings. The People appealed. The sole issue on appeal was the constitutionality of the statute. The court disagreed with the trial court's determination that &sect; 103(2) was facially unconstitutional. It could hardly be argued that, if the sanity of a defendant was properly an issue, the issue should not be settled before a trial of the merits of the alleged offenses. Viewing the matter solely in the light of facial constitutionality of the statute, the court found that the statute had passed the constitutional threshold of fundamental fairness. The statute did not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that: (1) the district court abused its discretion in denying defendant's sequestration motion; (2) the evidence failed to establish the existence of a public nuisance; (3) the evidence failed to show that defendant knew or should have known of the illegal activities; (4) the public nuisance statute was unconstitutionally vague; (5) the action should have been barred by laches; and (6) the trial court erred in ordering the sale of defendant's property. On appeal, the court held that the grant or denial of a sequestration motion lay in the trial court's discretion. The court held that there was ample evidence in the record to support the trial court's finding that defendant's business was continuously being used as a place of prostitution. The statute challenged made reasonably clear to those intended to be affected what conduct is within its scope. Although Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-13-303(1) did not define public or private place of prostitution with mathematical certainty, it was not unfair to defendant.

</DIV>

The wiretaps were intended to be for &quot;business security purposes.&quot; Defendant did not provide any signs that would give notice that electronic listening devices had been installed. The president also did not provide public notice of the wiretap, which was installed so that the employees would not be aware of the surreptitious eavesdropping device. A jury convicted defendant of violating the wiretapping statute, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-4-28 (1963). Defendant appealed from the conviction, arguing that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed, holding defendant failed to prove that the statute was vague. The court noted that while the statute did not specifically designate who was to give notice, the statute did require public notice to be given if the affirmative defense was invoked. Thus, the burden was on defendant, who asserted the affirmative defense, to prove that public notice was given.

The test called for the applicant to establish that the transportation to be performed was within the definition of &quot;contract carrier by motor vehicle&quot;, Colo. Rev.

Ann. &sect; 38-22-106(1) (1973) provided that all liens established related back to the time of the commencement of work and the architects and engineers commenced work prior to filing of the deed of trust; (2) the architects and engineers were both contractors within the meaning of &sect; 38-22-106(1); (3) the mechanics' lien statute did not violate due process; and (4) one of the lien claimants did not timely file its statement within three months after it last performed labor as required by Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-22-109(5).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment that 10 of the lien claimant's mechanics' liens had priority in time over the property owner's deed of trust.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state commenced a civil action against defendants to abate a public nuisance, contending that defendants were conducting their security guard service without obtaining a license to carry on a detective business as required by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-21-101 (1973). The district court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the action, holding the detective licensing statute unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed. The statute was unconstitutional in that it denied the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and by Colo. Const. art II, &sect; 25. The statute left the intended content of the term &quot;detective business&quot; unknown and unknowable not only from the standpoint of authorities charged with enforcement but also from the standpoint of businessmen charged with compliance. When a regulatory statute imposed criminal or civil sanctions, due process required that it be made reasonably clear to those intended to be affected what conduct was within its scope. This was particularly essential where the value of an existing business or investment could have been destroyed by injunction for failure to comply.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant corporation challenged a judgment of the District Court of Boulder County (Colorado), which rejected the corporation's claim that it was entitled to an exception under Boulder, Colo., Fire Code &sect; 1.2 from a provision requiring installation of automatic sprinkler systems in basements of a certain size. The trial court also ordered the corporation to install a sprinkler system or to otherwise conform its basement to Code regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation argued that the regulations at issue amounted to an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. On appeal, the court disagreed and affirmed. Boulder, Colo., Fire Code &sect; 14.4 required sprinkler system installation in basements of over 2500 square feet if combustible material was stored therein, such as in the corporation's building. Boulder, Colo., Fire Code &sect; 1.2 allowed the Chief of the Boulder, Colorado Bureau of Fire Prevention to grant exceptions when existing structures substantially complied with the Code and when there was no distinct hazard to life or property. Contrary to the corporation's claim, &sect; 1.2 did not apply because it dealt with technical variations in buildings in substantial Code compliance. Thus, the fact that the building was not in compliance at all because it had no sprinkler system and that a serious fire had occurred in the basement clearly supported the Chief's decision not to grant an exception. Finally, there was no merit to the corporation's discriminatory enforcement claim because the fact that some buildings had not yet been forced to install sprinkler systems did not amount to an unconstitutional discriminatory administration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from his conviction of rape and aggravated robbery. The case was transferred from the Colorado Court of Appeals because it involved the constitutionality of a portion of the aggravated robbery statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-302(2) (1973), which made defendant's verbal representation that he had a deadly weapon prima facie evidence that he was so armed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim turned around, saw a man following her, and kept walking. Within seconds, the man put a coat over her head, and raped her. He repeatedly stated that he had a gun. He asked her if she had any money, and she said she did. After he ran away, the victim discovered money missing from her purse. The victim identified defendant from photographs shown to her by the police. She again identified him in the courtroom, stating that she was absolutely certain he was her assailant. Defendant's woman friend corroborated his alibi. First, defendant's contention on appeal that &sect; 18-4-302(2) denied him due process by diluting the presumption of innocence and the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt failed because it had been previously rejected by the court. Second, the statute did deny defendant equal protection under the laws because it merely permitted the jury to infer that a defendant told the truth when he asserted that he was armed. The statute did not shift the prosecution's burden of proof or remove the distinction between simple and aggravated robbery. Third, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to determine if defendant took money from the victim's purse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's one-year deferred judgment and sentence provided that he not commit any criminal offense during that time. The probation department began revocation proceedings against defendant after he allegedly sexually assaulted a minor. At the hearing, defendant denied committing the sexual assault, but admitted that he used marijuana obtained through the allegedly assaulted minor. Consequently, defendant's probation was revoked and he was sentenced to reformatory. He argued that the trial court did not have authority to revoke probation prior to a determination of his guilt or innocence on the sexual assault on a minor and possession of narcotic drugs allegations. The court held that the procedures used by the trial court were authorized under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-11-202 (1973). Defendant argued that the deferred judgment was inherently unconstitutional because he had to forfeit either his Fifth or Sixth Amendment rights or his chance to avoid imprisonment and the stigma of a criminal conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district court dismissed the felony count of vehicular homicide on the ground that the statute defining vehicular homicide was indistinguishable from the statute defining criminally negligent homicide. The People appealed. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the legislature's decision to provide a more severe penalty for vehicular homicide than for criminal negligent homicide was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. The State of Colorado had a legitimate interest in discouraging a specific evil that it believed to be of greater societal consequence. This choice did not offend equal protection. Likewise, the fact that the district attorney, under this statutory scheme, might exercise prosecutorial discretion as to the statute under which he wished to prosecute, did not violate the tenets of equal protection. It was only where the same criminal conduct was proscribed in both statutes that the equal protection principle arose. Here, the vehicular homicide statute required the People to prove the additional element of a death caused through the use of a motor vehicle.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that an amendment to the information, which was made before the trial commenced, was one of substance and that reversible error resulted from the amendment. The court affirmed, holding that no violation of Colo. R. Crim. P. 7(e) occurred because the language inserted by the amendment only repeated the substance of the original charge of the sale of Cannabis Sativa L. The fact that THC might be produced in a synthetic form was irrelevant under the facts of the case. Thus, the amendment, under the particular facts of the case, was one of form only.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, the conservator of the estate of an incompetent person, brought an action for a declaratory judgment, wherein he sought a declaration that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 27-10-114 (as amended 1974), which pertained to mental incompetents, was unconstitutional. Respondent, the State of Colorado, sought review of a judgment of the District Court, Eighteenth Judicial District (Colorado), which declared &sect; 27-10-114 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A conservatorship estate was created for the benefit of a person who was declared a mental incompetent and who was adjudicated under a former commitment statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 27-9-101, et seq. The conservator contended that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 27-10-114 (as amended 1974) was unconstitutional because it violated the equal protection rights of incompetents who had guardians or conservators appointed on behalf of the estates of the incompetents. On appeal from the trial court's judgment declaring the statute unconstitutional, the court affirmed. The court reasoned that those adjudicated as incompetent or mentally ill composed a class. Section 27-10-114 obviously discriminated against a person within that class as to whom a petition for the appointment of a guardian or conservator had been filed. Other persons in the same class were automatically restored to competency in the absence of an ex parte act of someone in making such a filing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner employee appealed a judgment of the Industrial Commission of Colorado, which upheld a ruling of the Deputy of the Colorado Division of Employment granting the employee's interstate unemployment compensation claim but refusing payment until she worked 13 weeks in new employment. The award under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-73-108(8)(a) (1973) was based on a finding that the employee had voluntarily quit her job to fulfill a marital obligation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee argued that &sect; 8-73-108(8)(a) was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. On appeal, the court agreed. The State was permitted to deny benefits to those who voluntarily separated from employment, but once the State had chosen to provide some benefits under such circumstances, the scheme by which the benefits were determined had to have a rational basis. While &sect; 8-73-108(8)(a) authorized an award to the employee for leaving her job because her husband accepted out-of-state employment, entitlement to payment was conditioned on 13 weeks of subsequent employment. However, under &sect; 8-73-108(6), a person who left a job for no reason was penalized but could be entitled to benefits after the first 13 weeks even if he could not obtain employment during that time. Thus, the additional burden of requiring 13 weeks of work after separation to receive benefits imposed upon the class of persons who terminated employment for marital obligations as opposed to the lack of such requirement for those who terminated for no reason recognized as justifiable created an irrational classification which served no legitimate state purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On an application by petitioners, state by and on behalf of a city, the court issued a rule to show cause why a judgment of respondent county court judge should not be set aside. The judgment dismissed municipal court actions against two traffic defendants, holding that home rule cities could not provide for municipal judges without tenure and that a trial before a nontenured judge violated due process and equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The traffic defendants' motions to dismiss the charges against them in municipal court were denied and they were convicted. They appealed to the county court, where the county court judge dismissed the actions. The court made the rule absolute and directed the county court judge to reinstate the actions. Colo. Const. art. XX, &sect; 6 authorized home rule cities to enact charter provisions providing for the election or appointment of municipal court officers and stated that such matters were local. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-10-105(1) (1973) allowed home rule cities to specify the terms under which municipal judges held office, and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-10-103 (1973) allowed home rule cities to supersede by charter or ordinance all but a specified few of the statutory provisions governing municipal courts. The tenure decision therefore belonged to home rule cities. Where a nontenured municipal judge had neither the major executive function nor a personal pecuniary interest, there was no due process violation. The difference in treatment for home rule cities caused no arbitrary or irrational results, and the lack of tenure, in and of itself, was not sufficient to taint a trial's fairness.</SPAN></P>

He then returned to his neighbor's apartment and fired shots through her screen door. Defendant wounded one person and killed another. Defendant was convicted for murder and assault, and the court affirmed the district court's judgment. The court held that the murder statute was constitutional because it was distinguishable from the manslaughter statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-104(1)(a) (1973). The manslaughter statute required that the cause of death be recklessly done, while the murder statute required an extreme indifference to human life. The murder statute clearly required a more culpable standard of conduct. The court concluded that the manslaughter statute was indistinguishable from the criminal negligence statute, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-(1)(a) (1973), thus, inferentially, the murder statute was also distinguishable from the criminal negligence statute. The district court's refusal to allow the jury to view the scene was not an abuse of discretion because the screen door was admitted as evidence and there was testimony on the lack of visibility through the screen door at the time of the shooting.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The police arrested and charged defendant with driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 4-1202(1)(a) (1973). Defendant elected to take a breath test at the time of his arrest and, thereafter, filed a motion to produce the breath sample, which the state was unable to provide. Defendant filed a motion to suppress, which was granted, and the state appealed to the district court, which affirmed the trial court's ruling and held that the state's failure to preserve the breath sample was a denial of due process. On certiorari, the court reversed. The court held that the state's failure to preserve the breath sample did not violate due process. The court found that the state had no duty to administer any chemical test to a defendant, that the department's rules and regulations were not designed for the benefit of defendant, and that there was no evidence that the test could have been preserved or that the state deliberately withheld the breath sample.

The prosecution did not fail to disclose evidence of a blood alcohol test of the victim. The court found no error in jury instructions concerning proximate cause and reasonable doubt. It was not error to refuse a specific instruction on the credibility of eyewitnesses where a general instruction on credibility was given. Under the criminally negligent homicide statute,&nbsp;Colo.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee suffered serious injury while working for the employer as a waitress. In her compensation claim, a referee determined her average weekly wage without considering her tips. The employee sought review, and the Commission affirmed the referee's order, relying on prior case law. The employee sought further review, challenging the constitutionality of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-47-101(2) (1973). The employee sought further review, and the court reversed, overruling Industrial Comm'n v. Lindvay, 94 Colo. 531 (1934) to the extent that it held that tips were not wages for the purpose of determining average weekly wage and compensation benefits under the Colorado workmen's compensation scheme. The court reasoned that such practice violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the distinction created unequal treatment under the law between tipped and non-tipped employees was not rationally related to a legitimate state objective. In so holding, the court noted that the administrative expediency of such a scheme was insufficient to form a rational basis for an otherwise irrational distinction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-2-123 (1973) stated, in part: The Department had the authority to suspend the license of any driver who, in accordance with the schedule of points had been convicted of traffic violations resulting in the accumulation of 12 points within any 12 consecutive months or 18 points within any 24 consecutive months. The driver contended that none of the 30 points used in his first suspension might be again used in connection with the second suspension. The driver argued that pursuant to &sect; 42-2-123 the suspension of a driver's privileges could only have been for points accumulated in a 12-month period or a 24-month period, but not both. The court disagreed. The court held that the legislative intent was to authorize two suspensions in an instance where during the first year the driver accumulated 12 points and in the second year the driver accumulated six more points. Legislative history clearly demonstrated that it was the intent of the legislature to authorize the Motor Vehicle Division to consider that period of time ending with the date of the last violation involved. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional because of vagueness.</SPAN></P>

A service station was robbed by two men, one of whom displayed what appeared to be a gun. Two of the three eyewitnesses identified defendant in a photographic lineup and at a subsequent police lineup. At trial, all three identified defendant. Also, in a jury instruction derived from Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-4-302 (Perm. Supp. 1971), the trial judge charged that possession of any article used in a manner to lead any person who was present reasonably to believe it to have been a deadly weapon could considered as evidence that defendant was so armed. The court affirmed, holding that the photographic lineup was not impermissibly suggestive and did not taint later identifications. Thus, the trial court properly denied defendant's pre-trial motion to suppress both the out-of-court and in-court identifications. Also, the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions. Further, the jury instruction and statute merely shifted the burden of going forward with respect to the evidence and did not unconstitutionally shift the burden of proof. In addition, any facts assumed by the instruction were not controverted.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the state's citizenship requirements for a school district election did not contravene the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court stated that the state had a rational interest in limiting participation in government to those persons within the political community.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The police union filed a complaint, seeking to compel the city to submit to an election an initiative measure amending the Greeley City Charter. Upon the city's motion, the district court dismissed the complaint. The union appealed, and the parties stipulated that the constitutionality of the proposed amendment could not be resolved prior to the election. The initiative was approved by the electorate and the city filed a motion seeking a redetermination of the amendment's validity. The trial court again ruled that the charter provisions for binding arbitration violated Colo. Const. art. XXI, &sect; 4, and, deeming those provisions so central to the amendment that they could not be severed, declared the entire amendment invalid. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, holding that the amendment provisions concerning compulsory binding arbitration constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative power but, disapproving the ruling of the trial court that the amendment was not severable, concluded that the remaining valid portions of the amendment were complete in themselves and could be given full legal effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On June 4, 1969, an inspector of the Colorado Department of Health entered the premises of three of the corporation's plants to determine whether the corporation was violating air pollution control laws. The inspector concluded that the three plants were in violation of state emission regulations, but did not notify the corporation of his presence or his observations. On June 17, 1969, the corporation received a cease and desist order from the Department, which it appealed. The court found that for the purposes of the hearing before the Board, the results of the visual opacity inspection were wholly relevant and admissible. However, the court determined that procedural due process and fundamental fairness demanded that the evidence of the opacity readings be excluded because of the lack of timely notice to the corporation. The court ruled that the delay of notice all but foreclosed the corporation's opportunity to successfully challenge the findings of the inspector. Affirming, the court held that due process required that notice of the readings should have been given within a reasonably short period of time after the inspection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was involved in an automobile accident and subsequently acknowledged her receipt of a notice informing her that failure upon her part to comply with at least one of several alternatives within 20 days would cause suspension of her license. The notice comported with the provisions of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-7-301 (1973). Although not required to do so, the motor vehicle department mailed to defendant by registered mail an order of suspension. Defendant was later tried in the county court for driving a vehicle while under suspension. The trial court found that there was no evidence that defendant had actually received the second mailing containing the order of suspension and declared that the statutory language of the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-7-101 et seq. (1973) that evidence of mailing was sufficient evidence of service was unconstitutional and denied defendant due process. Disapproving the affirmance of the ruling, the court stated that the statute providing notice of the action that was to have been taken by defendant was fully complied with.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff district attorney challenged an order of respondent County Court, County of Larimer (Colorado), which dismissed criminal harassment charges against a defendant under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-9-111(1)(h)(1973). The trial court held that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague on its face and violated the freedom of speech clauses of U.S. Const. amend. 1 and Colo. Const. Art. II, &sect; 10. The court issued a rule to show cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court contended that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it prohibited repeated speech and the word &quot;repeatedly&quot; was vague. It also asserted that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it required the speaker to know the emotional impact that his words would have on the recipient. The district attorney contended that the statute was not facially overbroad because it was limited to &quot;fighting words&quot; by defining harassment as communications likely to provoke a violent and disorderly response. The court agreed. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague on its face. It proscribed only words that had a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the individuals to whom the words were addressed. The test was what men of common intelligence would understand to be words likely to cause an average addressee to fight. Moreover, &quot;repeatedly&quot; was a word of common understanding and in the context of the statute it applied when a speaker use harassing language more than once.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded to the trial court with orders to reinstate the criminal charges. The court reversed the trial court's finding that the harassment statute was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague on its face and violated freedom of speech.</SPAN></P>

(1973), was the assignee of certain accounts and notes payable. Acting by its attorney, the agency brought separate actions against three debtors in their attempt to collect the items for a contingent fee. The debtors brought companion actions to enjoin the collection agency from prosecuting the actions upon the ground that the collection agency was engaging in the unauthorized practice of law in violation of Colo. Const. art. III and art. VI, &sect; 21, and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-5-101 (1973). The trial court dismissed for failure to state a claim. After the appeal was transferred, the Supreme Court of Colorado affirmed the dismissal, concluding that the collection agency was not practicing law in that it had not agreed to, nor had it, furnished legal advice or legal services to the creditors. Rather, as assignee of the accounts and notes, the collection agency was the one entitled to bring the action and, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, the assignee who has obtained the legal title to the account or note receivable, was privileged to bring an action without consulting the assignor.</SPAN></P>

Defendants' main contentions for reversal were that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain their convictions, and that the statutory rape statute was unconstitutional because it applied only to male offenders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim testified at trial that she was raped. She identified defendants as two of the perpetrators. The victim then testified to a second incident involving many of the same individuals. Defendants contended that the victim's testimony was wholly unreliable as demonstrated by her sometimes inconsistent testimony, by her mistaken placement of one defendant at the scene of the crime, and by her failure to make an immediate in-court identification of a second defendant. They also argued that the other prosecution witnesses never corroborated the victim's testimony as to actual penetration. On appeal, the court found that when the evidence was viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution, the evidence, together with reasonable inferences therefrom, was sufficient to sustain defendants' convictions. The court also found that defendants were not denied equal protection of the law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and the Equal Rights Amendment of the Colorado Constitution because the statute defining rape, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-3-401 (1963), operated on a reasonable classification based upon physiological differences between the sexes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who was charged with rape, appealed from his conviction for gross sexual imposition. The court held that the trial court did not err when it instructed the jury that gross sexual imposition was a lesser included offense of rape. The gross sexual imposition statute, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-3-402(1)(a) (1963 &amp; Supp. 1971), contained the same elements required to prove rape, and the only difference between the two crimes was the degree of harm threatened. The court also ruled that the trial court properly instructed the jury regarding the lesser included offense after defendant objected to the instruction. The lesser included offense requested by the prosecution was easily ascertainable from the charging instrument and not so remote in degree from the offense charged that the prosecution's request appeared to be an attempt to salvage a conviction from a weak case. The court rejected defendant's claim that &sect; 40-3-402(1)(a) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Defendant's assertion that the statute denied males equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and concluded that the section passed muster under the Equal Rights Amendment, Colo. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner employee appealed an order of the Industrial Commission of Colorado, which, pursuant to the terms of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-73-108(8)(d)(IV), refused to pay unemployment insurance benefits to her until she had worked for 13 weeks in full-time employment following the termination of her pregnancy, in the employee's claim against respondent employer for unemployment insurance benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the employee was nine months pregnant, the employer granted her a medical leave of absence. When she was ready to return to work, the employer advised her that there were no job openings available. The employee then filed her request for unemployment benefits. A special award was made by the Commission, but in accordance with &sect; 8-73-108(8)(d)(IV), payments were not to commence until she had completed 13 weeks of full-time employment after the termination of the pregnancy. The employee appealed the Commission's decision. The court held that &sect; 8-73-108(8)(d)(IV) was unconstitutional because it created an impermissible conclusive presumption that any woman who had been pregnant was unable to work until she has worked for 13 weeks following the termination of her pregnancy. This presumption applied to no one else. Section 8-73-108(8)(d)(IV) made actual ability and actual intent irrelevant; the statutory presumption of incapacity and unwillingness to return to work foreclosed any inquiry into the actual facts of a particular case. Thus, &sect; 8-73-108(8)(d)(IV) violated the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The denial was based on the finding that the benefits to which she might have been entitled when reduced by the amount of her retirement pay left her with zero unemployment benefits. The claimant challenged the Commission's power to make the deduction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Claimant was employed in state service. She was compelled to retire at the age of 57 because her husband's health required a move to a warmer climate. She elected to receive retirement benefits on a reduced annuity basis pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-51-109(4) (1973). The Commission denied claimant's claim on the basis of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-73-110(3)(a)(I) (1973). Claimant argued that the Commission misinterpreted &sect; 8-73-110(3)(a)(I). She asserted that the pension payments she was receiving constituted solely her own funds contributed during her years of state employment to the Public Employees' Retirement Association. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-51-106(1) (1973) provided that the retirement fund consisted of all money paid including the employer's contribution. The claimant also argued that the Commission's interpretation effected an unconstitutional denial of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that neither suspect classifications nor the infringement of fundamental rights were involved, a statutory discrimination had facts that reasonably justified it.

Four contractors comprised a joint venture that served as the project's general contractor.

When the trial court granted summary judgment to the contractors, the survivors appealed, and the court affirmed. Under &sect; 8-48-101, the general contractor was not liable for injuries or death to a subcontractor's employee when the subcontractor insured its liability for such compensation. Summary judgment was proper because the facts showed that the decedent was a subcontractor's employee and that the subcontractor paid the survivors workers' compensation benefits. Section &sect; 8-48-101 was constitutional because it had a rational basis in the state's interest in protecting general contractors from negligence liability when they were required to pay workers' compensation unless the subcontractors did.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ranch filed an application in the water court for approval of a plan of augmentation. The purpose of the plan was to provide a water supply through wells for the residents of three proposed subdivisions. The ranch, under an agreement with the developers, proposed to remove from irrigation a portion of the water the ranch diverted from the river system for irrigation purposes to compensate for any well water consumptively used. The district objected, alleging that granting the application would injury the district's water rights and that the plan would not produce water adequate to reimburse the river system for the depletions caused by the subdivision use. The water court dismissed the application, finding that it was not properly a plan for augmentation under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 37-92-103(9) because there was no addition of new water into the water system. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, finding, among other things, that the validity of the plan, under the circumstances, did not require the injection of new water and that the water court could consider and make allowances for the return flows involved from the consumptive uses of the residents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The individuals filed petitions for the recall of the Treasurer with the office of the Clerk.

The number of signatures on the petitions was less than that percentage but more than 25 percent of the entire vote cast for the office. Also, the number of signatures of registered electors was less than the 25 percent figure. The rejection of the petitions was predicated on Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30-10-202 (1975 Supp.). The court affirmed the district court's judgment. The court held that while Colo. Const. art. XXI, &sect; 4 delegated the recall power to subordinate levels of state government, the delegation was limited to procedural matters and substantive provisions not in conflict with the Colorado Constitution. The 40 percent statutory requirement set forth in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30-10-202 (1975 Supp.) was a substantive provision in conflict with the Colorado Constitution.

Stat. &sect; 40-1-508(5)(c) (Supp. 1971) was unconstitutionally vague, failed to provide adequate notice of the conduct proscribed and failed to give jurors a standard against which to measure that conduct, and that the State was not entitled to an instruction on the lesser-included offense. The court affirmed the conviction and stated that a conviction depended on the factfinder's determination (from the standpoint of that of a reasonable person) that the threat used by defendant was sufficient enough to be reasonably calculated to prevent resistance by the victim. The court held that the fact that a penal statute was framed in a way such as to require a jury to determine a question of reasonableness did not make it too vague to afford a practical guide to acceptable behavior. The court concluded that the statute provided a fair description of the conduct forbidden, and persons of ordinary intelligence could comprehend its meaning and application.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The election was held to determine if the electors of the district would approve the financing and construction of a new sewage system. A canvass of the votes revealed that the bond question had passed.

R. Civ. P. 56(c). The court rejected the residents' claim that their statutory and constitutional rights were violated by a defective notice of election and insufficient publication of the notice. The publication requirements of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-1-802(5) were satisfied by publication in county-specific newspapers, rather than state-wide newspapers, and an erroneous election date on an information brochure was not decisive because the proper date was given elsewhere in the brochure and corrected brochures were mailed.

However, applying the statute, the Commission permitted the employer to take credit for and withhold payment of the permanent partial disability benefits to which the claimant was entitled.

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that although &sect; 18-2-205 was not unconstitutionally vague because it gave fair warning of the prohibited conduct, the law violated equal protection principles and due process rights because the attachment of criminal liability depended upon a third-party's discretion in deciding whether to pay a check when there was insufficient funds in the drawer's account.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was a skilled ironworker and was employed by a subcontractor that was retained to provide services to the corporation. The employee sustained extensive injuries as a result of an explosion of a basic oxygen furnace at the corporation's manufacturing plant. The insurance company provided workmen's compensation insurance for the subcontractor employer and subsequently made compensation payments to the employee. The employee and the insurance company filed a complaint against the corporation based upon negligence and strict liability by which the employee sought damages for his injuries and the insurance company sought reimbursement for sums paid under its workmen's compensation policy. The trial court granted the corporation's motion for summary judgment, and the employee and insurance company appealed. The court affirmed the judgment and held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 81-9-2 (1963) immunized the corporation from liability and did not violate either the state or federal constitutions. The court stated that it rejected the employee's &quot;common employment&quot; argument and concluded that any changes to the statute were for the legislature to address, not for the court.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-9-106(1)(a) (1963), was facially overbroad or vague, denying freedom of speech guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two of the lower courts found the statute unconstitutional and one found it constitutional. On certiorari, the court concluded that the subsection was unconstitutional because it was facially overbroad, and the court declined to restrictively construe the subsection. The court noted that the vagueness issue was moot. The court observed that the statute prohibited certain types of utterances, gestures, and displays in a public place, and it was clear that the statute's proscription applied to speech and expression closely akin to speech. The court held that the subsection must be subjected to exacting judicial scrutiny, finding that the only exception permitting the legislature to enact the statute was the fighting words exception, but the subsection did not attempt to limit its application to fighting words. Instead, the court asserted that the statute applied to proscribed communications without regard to their probable effect, sweeping within its coverage protected as well as unprotected speech; therefore it was facially overbroad. The judgments were affirmed in part and reversed in part.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court, in consolidating three cases on the same question of whether the disorderly conduct statute was overbroad, concluded that it was unconstitutional as facially overbroad and declined to restrictively construe it, causing the vagueness issue to become moot.</SPAN></P>

The district court's judgment upheld the dismissal and found in favor of the school district. The court affirmed the district court's judgment in part and reversed in part. The court held that the teacher failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality for Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 22-63-116 (1973). The teacher's actions constituted immorality within the meaning of &sect; 22-63-116 because implicit within his dismissal was the finding that his actions indicated an unfitness to teach. &quot;Immorality&quot; in &sect; 22-63-116 was not unduly vague. It was error to require the teacher to pay any of the costs that were associated with the dismissal hearing because Colo. Rev.

The trial court affirmed, and the company appealed claiming that the Commission's order violated due process. The court held that the company's due process rights were not violated because the allocation of costs was reasonable and fair. The Commission properly construed &sect; 115-4-6(2)(b) by eliminating the consideration of maintenance costs in determining the allocation of installation costs. Furthermore, railroad companies could be charged with the entire installation costs of safety devices if such devices were necessary for local safety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A store was robbed by two male suspects, one of whom was wearing a three-quarter length, purple, crushed velvet coat with white trim on the edges. About the same time, a hit-and-run accident occurred near the store. The victim reported that the suspects drove off in a whitetopped, blue-bottomed Dodge with a temporary license sticker. Defendants were arrested in a car matching the description. An officer inspected the car at the towing yard and removed a three-quarter length, purple, crushed velvet coat with white trim on the edges. He filed a report. Another officer investigating the robbery seized the coat and other evidence. The trial court held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-302(2) (1973) was unconstitutional because it relieved the prosecution of the burden of proving that defendants were armed with a deadly weapon. The court disagreed, holding that the presumption created by the statute met the test described by the United States Supreme Court. However, the court reversed the judgment because defendants' automobile was in police custody and no exigent circumstances existed to justify the warrantless search.</SPAN></P>

The court issued a rule to respondents, a district court and one of its judges, to show cause why the People's contentions should not be sustained. The district court had granted a motion to give an instruction to prospective jurors in advance of voir dire.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to commencement of the trial, the district court granted a motion by defendant to give a certain instruction to prospective jurors in advance of voir dire. The instruction indicated that in the event defendant was found guilty of murder, the law required that the jury consider whether or not a death penalty should be imposed. The instruction further provided that in responding to the questions that would be put to the jury regarding the death penalty, the jurors had to keep in mind their duty. The People argued that any mention to the jury of the death penalty was forbidden. In disposing of the rule to show cause in conformity with the views expressed in the court's opinion, the court found that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-11-103 (Supp. 1975) neither expressly nor impliedly precluded the jury's knowledge of the consequences of their verdict. Fundamental fairness dictated that appropriate questions on voir dire be asked of the jury concerning capital punishment. The court followed Colo. R. Crim. P. 24(a). The court did not approve the district court's instruction and set forth a proper ante-voir dire instruction.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court ruled that defendant's allegations of error had no merit and affirmed the judgment of conviction. The court ruled that there was no error in the instruction given by the trial court because whether there was premeditation or not was never an issue in the case. The court found that there was a knowing and voluntary consent to the search of defendant's motel room. The court concluded that defendant had no proprietary or possessory interest in a stolen truck upon which he could base standing to challenge the legality of the search. The court ruled that the trial court's finding that defendant's statement was volunteered and that new Miranda warnings were unnecessary was adequately supported by the record. The court found that defendant's assignment of error with regard to discovery was too speculative.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-5-20 (1963).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An anonymous informant arranged a meeting between defendant and an undercover agent at defendant's residence, where they purchased narcotics from defendant. A young man was in the house watching television during the transaction. Neither defendant nor the State called the young man as a witness. Defendant argued that the trial court committed reversible error when it denied his pretrial motion to compel disclosure of the anonymous informant's identity. The court disagreed, holding that defendant made no affirmative showing of his need for disclosure by showing that he did not know the informant. The court found, however, that the record was totally devoid of any evidence that defendant solicited the sale or that he sold the narcotics with intent to aid or induce the buyers to use or possess the narcotic. The court vacated the conviction for sale with intent to aid or induce. The court, however, found that the evidence supported the conviction of the lesser included offense of simple sale of narcotics under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-5-2 (1963). On remand, the trial court was directed to enter a judgment of conviction under that section of the drug statute and resentence defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, the employer, the Industrial Commission of Colorado, and the State Compensation Insurance Fund, sought review of the judgment for plaintiff employee by the District Court, Second Judicial District (Colorado). The trial court ruled that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-60-110(1)(g) (1973), requiring that an injury or death from silicosis resulted from at least five years of exposure in Colorado within the last 10 years, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While employed by a Colorado employer, the claimant became totally disabled from silicosis. He sought compensation under the Colorado Occupational Disease Disability Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-60-110 et seq. (1973). The Commission denied his claim under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-60-110(1)(g) because he was disabled from silicosis and because he was not exposed to dusts for at least 5 of the last 10 years within the state. The claimant filed a declaratory action against defendants alleging that &sect; 8-60-110(1)(g) was unconstitutional. The trial court awarded judgment to the claimant and held that the statute was unconstitutional as violative of the Equal Protection Clause and the due process provisions. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court applied that rational basis test to analyze the statute and held that it violated the Equal Protection Clause because the five-year exposure requirement bore no reasonable relationship to the state's objective for administrative convenience in screening out applicants. The length of exposure had little value as a criterion for definitely establishing a causal connection between the employment-related exposure and the disease.</SPAN></P>

The notice of assessment and the municipal ordinances under which the notice was sent fully complied with the due process clauses of the Colorado and United States Constitutions. The court affirmed. The trial court held an extensive adversary hearing and found that the taxpayer received proper notice and did not challenge the assessment within 10 days. The taxpayer had a full opportunity to challenge the assessment and failed to make even colorable compliance with the procedures set out in the ordinances. Failure to exhaust administrative remedies in tax statutes establishing procedures similar to the procedures mandated by the ordinances precluded judicial review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the classification of marijuana as a narcotic drug at the time he was convicted was unconstitutional, that the evidence did not show that marijuana was a narcotic drug, and that he could not be properly convicted of a sale to induce illegal possession where the purchaser was a police officer. The court held that defendant's assertions of error were without merit. The court determined that the classification of marijuana as a narcotic at the time of his conviction did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court further held that it was not necessary for the prosecution to prove that marijuana was in fact a narcotic drug. Once the classification of marijuana as a narcotic drug satisfied the threshold constitutional rationality, the legislature was free to proscribe a conspiracy with intent to induce another to illegally possess that drug. Regarding the sale to a police officer, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-5-20(1)(a) only required defendant have the intent to induce possession. Thus, the critical element to be proved was intent, and intent could exist whether or not the purchaser actually could be induced to illegally use the drug.</SPAN></P>

Consolidating the three cases on appeal, the state supreme court affirmed in part, concluding that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague, even though the defendants, charged with possession of guns, had no standing to attack the statute as vague because it incorporated an all-encompassing definition of &quot;knife.&quot; Nor was the statute overbroad because the right of a convicted felon to bear arms under Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 13, was subject to reasonable legislative regulation and limitation. The court then held that &sect; 18-12-108, the felon with a gun statute, was a legitimate exercise of the state's police power so it reversed in part, and remanded with directions to the district court to reinstate the informations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board alleged that the dealership had sold a vehicle with the odometer reset to an inaccurately low figure. In reversing the trial court's judgment, which affirmed the Board's suspension decision, the court ruled that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-11-18(3)(k), which prohibited &quot;unconscionable practices,&quot; was unconstitutionally vague on its fact. The court ruled that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment required that before a person was deprived of life, liberty, or property he should be afforded due process of law. Penalties could not be imposed for violations of a standard, the meaning of which was dependent upon surmise or conjecture or uncontrolled application by the Board. &quot;Unconscionability&quot; was a concept that brought forth certain general feelings in the minds of all. The parameters of those feelings and reactions, however, varied widely among individuals. What was &quot;unconscionable&quot; could well vary from board to board. Where criminal or quasi-criminal sanctions were to be imposed, the threat of arbitrary enforcement of the law required more specificity. The dealership could have been charged under a more specific subsection. The &quot;catch-all&quot; provision was improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent tenants appealed a decision of the District Court of Boulder County (Colorado) that entered summary judgment in favor of petitioner, the City of Boulder, in its action brought under the Public Mall Act of 1970, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-25-401 et seq. (1973), and the eminent domain statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-1-101 et seq. (1973).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The City adopted Boulder, Colo., Ordinance 4022, which established a pedestrian mall on a certain street. Under the ordinance, vehicular and bicycle traffic was prohibited on the street during certain times. The tenants of the adjoining buildings on the street claimed that they were entitled to compensation under the eminent domain statutes. The City initiated an action under the Public Mall Act and the eminent domain statute. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the City, finding that there were no compensable takings. In affirming the judgment, the court found that the mall did not create unreasonable restrictions upon pedestrian access to the tenants' buildings. Delivery services to the buildings would not be unreasonably restricted because such deliveries continued except for a six-hour period in the afternoon. The Act was not unconstitutional merely because it required the tenants to file a claim after the City adopted a mall resolution. The court conceded that the process was different than the usual condemnation suit but the difference in procedure did not reach constitutional height.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs alleged that the ordinance violated plaintiffs' rights to due process and equal protection. Affirming the trial court's decision, the court found that plaintiffs did not meet their burden of proving the ordinance unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the object of the statute was to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the community, a legitimate municipal interest. The court further found that the legislative classifications of the ordinance bore a rational relationship to the legitimate interest of the municipality and thus the ordinance complied with traditional equal protection standards and was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The district court stated several times that it was making no representations that it would sentence defendant under the Act and that a sentence of imprisonment was a possibility. At a subsequent hearing, the district court stated that it had received the reports and that the psychiatrists and the probation officer had opined that defendant was not a candidate for rehabilitation and was a danger to society. The district court again stated that it was not bound to sentence under the Act. Defendant stated that he understood. The proceedings under the Act were terminated and defendant was sentenced. The court held that the sentence was proper because Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-13-209 (1973) allowed the district court to terminate the proceedings after reviewing the reports and to proceed with sentencing.

The court issued a rule to show cause and subsequently made the rule absolute, holding that, until annexation was effected, the district court lacked jurisdiction and the county commissioners lacked standing because the city did not yet have jurisdiction over the property and could not control or cause the development of the property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The District Court, Fourth Judicial District (Colorado) convicted defendant of first-degree burglary and as a habitual criminal. He was sentenced according to the Habitual Criminal Statute, 1972 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 44, &sect; 39-13-101. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that evidence found in his car pursuant to an inventory search prejudiced his case in regard to the question of his ability to form the specific intent necessary to commit the burglary. The court noted that the police caught him inside the pharmacy while armed and while taking drugs off the shelves. A crowbar and suitcases were found inside the pharmacy. During his arrest, he told the police that he did it for the drugs. That evidence amply supported a jury finding that defendant had the requisite specific intent to commit first-degree burglary. Therefore, even assuming that the trial court committed error by not suppressing the inventoried items, such could not have materially and substantially prejudiced defendant because there was an overwhelming amount of competent evidence apart from that disputed evidence to support his conviction. Defendant argued that the Habitual Criminal statute was unconstitutional in its application because its rare use and severity of punishment rendered it a denial of equal protection of the laws, due process of law, and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that habitual criminal statutes were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, appellant sought review, claiming the Uniform Dissolution of Marriage Act (Act), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-10-101 et seq. (1973), was unconstitutional. In affirming, the court held the Act had not violated Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 11's impairment of contracts clause because marriages were creatures of the state and were not &quot;contracts&quot; under the contracts clause. The court also held irretrievable breakdown, as a ground for dissolution, was not vague and overbroad and thus, the Act was not violative of due process. Similarly, the court held due process had not been violated because the Act had made provision for adequate notice and hearing before dissolution. Finally, the court rejected appellant's contention that the Act had violated Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 26's prohibition against involuntary servitude. In rejecting the argument that appellant would be forced to work for the benefit of appellee's attorney, despite an absence of fault, the court held the Act's assessment of attorney's fees had been intended to equalize parties in a dissolution proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court dismissed the claim for review under Colo. R. Civ.

It did, however, grant appellees a trial de novo on their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief. Reversing the trial court's decision, the court held that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the action for declaratory and injunctive relief. The court reasoned that Colo. R. Civ. P. 106(a)(4) was the exclusive remedy to challenge a rezoning determination where the entire general zoning ordinance was not challenged and where a review of the record would have been an adequate remedy. The court found that appellees' failure to bring their Rule 106(a)(4) proceeding within 30 days of the enactment of the rezoning ordinance was a jurisdictional defect under Colo. R. Civ. P. 106(b). The court concluded that appellees impermissibly sought to accomplish by a declaratory judgment and an injunction what they were no longer able to accomplish directly under Rule 106(a)(4).</SPAN></P>

He argued that the statute violated his rights under the First Amendment. Upon review, the court reversed. It found that defendant had standing to challenge the statute because it was dealing with First Amendment protections. The statute stated a person committed harassment if, with the intent to harass, annoy, or alarm another person, he communicated with that person in a manner likely to harass or cause alarm. The court held that the statute was overbroad on its face and unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 10. The court found that under the statute, as written, speech that was constitutionally permissible could have been punished. While a person had a right of privacy in his home, the court found that right did not prohibit the communication of ideas by mail when the sender had not been requested to refrain from doing so, especially when a person was free to discard any mail he did not wish to receive.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed on the ground that defendant failed to meet his burden of proving that the statute was unconstitutional on its face. The court found that defendant was unable to demonstrate that the statute reached constitutionally protected conduct. The court determined that the statute was drafted in words that were not susceptible to difficulties of interpretation by a person of common understanding and intelligence. Absent indications that the statute was being applied to conduct which a citizen could not reasonably have known was forbidden, the statute should not be ruled unconstitutional on grounds of facial vagueness. As to the statute being allegedly overbroad, the court ruled that defendant failed to assert that the statute proscribed conduct that overlapped constitutionally protected conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant landlord appealed from the order of the Superior Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado), which entered judgment in favor of plaintiff tenants in their action alleging the landlord's failure to return their security deposit or supply a written explanation for retaining it. The trial court awarded treble damages pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-12-103(3)(a) and dismissed the landlord's counterclaim for alleged damage to the house.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court noted that under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-12-103(2), a secured landlord forfeited her right to bring an action against the tenant for damage to the premises if she failed to return the security deposit or provide an explanation for retaining it within 30 days, while an unsecured landlord would not lose such a cause of action. The court held that the statute imposed an unreasonable and discriminatory class distinction between secured and unsecured landlords, and held the clause by which the right to bring an action for damage to the premises was forfeited to be unconstitutional and stricken from the statute. Therefore, it was error for the trial court to dismiss the landlord's counterclaim. The court agreed with the trial court that the landlord's failure to return the security deposit or explain its retention was willful for the purposes of the statute if it was deliberate, and thus the fact that she allegedly had valid reasons to keep the security deposit did not excuse her failure to comply with the statutory timeframe. The court held that the penalty provision of the statute applied to whatever money was wrongfully retained, plus attorney's fees and court costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment for the tenants, and reversed the dismissal of the landlord's counterclaim. The court remanded the cause to the trial court with directions to reinstate the counterclaim and to hold a new trial on that issue, with any judgment to be offset against the judgment already awarded the tenants.</SPAN></P>

The convictions were reversed in the district court. On further appeal, the court affirmed the judgment from the district court.

The state legislature had the power to limit, modify, or abolish the exemption provided by the constitution. The court held that the exemption statute did not contravene the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause since there was clearly a valid basis for the statutory requirement that the real property must be owned and used by the charitable organization before an exemption was allowed and, within the two classes of ownership, all persons or entities were treated similarly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was convicted of burglary and sentenced to the state penitentiary in Colorado. Wisconsin authorities filed a retainer against the inmate, and the inmate requested that the Governor of Colorado not permit his removal from the state, to which request he received no reply. The inmate also filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and a motion for a restraining order against the warden, and only the motion was granted. The attorney general moved to vacate such order, and the motion was denied. The warden appealed, and the court held that the trial court properly restrained the transfer of the inmate until a hearing could be held, but it failed to construe the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 74-17-1 (1969), so that it could pass constitutional muster. The court found that in addition to the inmate's right under article IV(a) of the Agreement to petition or to file a motion with the governor relating to the transfer, limited review also existed in the courts.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Before the court were interrogatories propounded by the state senate concerning House Bill 1078 (bill) which would amend the boundary lines of certain state representative districts prior to the establishment and operation of a state reapportionment commission after the next federal census, which commission was established pursuant to an amendment directing that it cease to exist following the filing of its approved reapportionment plan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two amendments had passed, both of which dealt with reapportionment. The court held that only one of the amendments was valid. That amendment established a commission that would promulgate a plan of reapportionment, which the state supreme court would either approve or order modified. The amendment also provided that there be no intervening reapportionment between the lives of commissions created after each federal census. The court found that the amendment, in providing that any reapportionment plan must be submitted by the commission to the state supreme court, did not constitute a violation of the doctrine of separation of powers because (1) that amendment permitted such action by the court; and (2) a republican form of government guaranteed to the states by article IV, &sect; 4 of the Federal Constitution did not embody within it the doctrine of separation of powers. The court concluded that the bill was unconstitutional because it would, in violation of the amendment, amend the boundary lines of certain state representative districts prior to the establishment and operation of the state reapportionment commission after the next federal census.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court answered the interrogatories, concluding that a certain constitutional amendment was valid and not in violation of the doctrine of separation of powers and that the house bill was unconstitutional because it would, in violation of the constitutional amendment, amend the boundary lines of state representative districts prior to the establishment of a state reapportionment commission after the next federal census.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion. Defendant was found guilty. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that a prior case was dispositive of defendant's argument that the legislative classification lacked a rational basis. The court noted that &sect; 48-5-2 was upheld based on deference to the legislature as the proper forum for resolution of how best to advance the public's health, safety, and welfare. The court held that defendant did not have standing to raise the issue of whether &sect; 48-5-2 was vague in its proscription of drugs other than cannabis because he was only convicted for possession of cannabis. The court held that the definition of cannabis in &sect; 48-5-2 was sufficiently precise and was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the husband contended that the district court abused its discretion with respect to custody and property disposition and that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 46-1-30 (1971 Perm. Supp.) was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding custody to the wife since there was evidence that the wife would be more responsive to the needs of a 20-month-old child than the husband. Further, the court held that district court did not err in treating the family home as marital property, and in valuing the home on the basis of gross rather than net equitable value. The equity in the house, which consisted of the husband's separate property, was properly set aside to him and one-half of the marital property was allowed as appreciation to the wife, a joint tenant. Finally, the court held that the statute, which gave the custodial parent the right to determine a child's upbringing, did not violate the Equal Protection Clause as guaranteed under U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A juvenile court judge sent a directive to the warden of the county jail, the director of the juvenile detention center, referees, and a deputy district attorney which addressed the confinement practices of juveniles. Given the increasing overcrowding of juvenile facilities, the judge felt it necessary to publish standards for such placement with adult offenders to conform with Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 22-3-6(a), 22-3-6(c) (1963). After determining that the juvenile was qualified to bring the action under Colo. R. Civ. P. 23, the court addressed the juvenile's arguments and discharged the rule to show cause, holding that: 1) the directive was a viable court order; 2) it was not an unconstitutional delegation of the lower court's statutory powers to another branch of the government in violation of Colo. Const. art. III, and the explicit legislative intent under the Colorado Children's Code; and 3) the directive as applied did not violate the juvenile's constitutional rights of due process and equal protection as guaranteed by both the U.S. Const., amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant assisted her husband in the running of a funeral home for years, and after his death, the applicant applied to the Board for a funeral director license. After a hearing, the Board denied the application based on the applicant's failure to meet the statutory educational requirements provided in the Mortuary Science Code of 1967, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 61-4-1 et seq. (1967 Supp.). The applicant brought an action against the Board, and the trial court decreed that the Code was unconstitutional and that the applicant should be allowed to take the examination for a funeral director license. The Board appealed, and the court held that the applicant failed to sustain her burden of proof in showing facts establishing conclusively that the Code's legislative purpose was unnecessary, unreasonable, and arbitrary. The court found no cited authority to show that reciprocity was unconstitutional under the Code if the same requirements were applied in another state as were applicable to those who were &quot;grandfathered&quot; under the Code.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 71-8-2(3)(a) (1963 &amp; Perm. Supp. 1971).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A community board serving handicapped and mentally retarded persons, advocates for handicapped children, and the parent of a handicapped child brought an action in mandamus to compel the school district to pay over certain amounts for educational services provided by the community board. The trial court ordered the payments to be made, and the court affirmed in that respect. The court held that defendants lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 71-8-2(3)(a) and found that a free kindergarten maintained by the community board was a &quot;regular school program&quot; to which the pay-over provision applied. The court reversed the judgment only as to the superintendent. The court found that the superintendent had no control of the money of the school district, that he was not a proper party defendant, and that the complaint should have been dismissed as to him. The court affirmed the denial of attorney fees and prejudgment interest. The court found that none of the theories advanced by plaintiffs justified an award of fees and that, because the case did not arise out of contract or out of a fiduciary relationship, plaintiffs were not entitled to prejudgment interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court held that the board did not comply with notice provisions, that they considered evidence after the public hearing, that the dwelling density was incompatible with the surrounding area, that there was no evidence that adequate sewage facilities were available, that the board did not consider the general public's wishes, and that the PUD ordinance was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. The notices of public hearing were posted and published and fairly apprised the public of the proposed zoning change and did not require the name of the applicant. Although the board did not strictly comply with the regulation and reviewed a letter after the public hearing, this was an minor aspect of an extensive process and did not deprive anyone of due process. The zoning change would not be incompatible with the surrounding land uses. The availability of sewage facilities was a factor to be considered later, not at the rezoning stage. The court did not sit as a zoning board of appeals and did not substitute its judgment for that of the board. There was no prejudicial error.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant shot a man he believed was up to no good on his property. The man died en route to a second hospital after a doctor at the first hospital failed to discover the entrance wound. Defendant argued that the cause of death was inadequate medical care. He also argued that the portion of &sect; 40-3-104 under which he was convicted was unconstitutional in that the requirement to sustain a conviction was indistinguishable from the required to sustain a conviction for criminally negligent homicide under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-3-105. Reversing, the court held that the distinction between a gross deviation from, and a wanton and willful disregard of, a standard of care was not sufficiently apparent to be intelligently and uniformly applied. The court held that gross negligence would not be reasonably foreseeable and would constitute a defense and that the jury instructions should include such an instruction.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the criminal impersonation statute was not unconstitutionally vague since the words used therein were simple, understandable, and of common usage, sufficiently explicit in terms to fairly inform a person of common intelligence of what conduct was forbidden and would render him liable to criminal penalties. Further, the court held that the statute was not overbroad because the proscribed conduct was limited to those false impersonations undertaken to accomplish unlawful purposes.</SPAN></P>

After the jury returned its verdict, the trial judge remanded defendant to the county jail pending the completion of a presentence investigation. Defendant, at the time the robbery was committed, had been released on parole for only one month from the penitentiary. Defense counsel filed a motion for a new trial and was provided with a copy of the presentence investigation. The presentence investigation reflected defendant's history and his participation in numerous crimes of violence. Defendant declined to make any statement regarding his background. The court upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 40-4-302. The key prosecution witness tied defendant to both the robbery and a conspiracy that was entered into to rob two drug stores.

The ordinance set up a schedule of property assessments to pay for the conversion costs and provided for issuance of bonds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found for the town and the utilities on all issues. The court affirmed the judgment. The privately-owned utilities came within the definition of public utilities. Although the state constitution prohibited any donation or grant by any municipality to any corporation or company, and the utilities would be paid for something they could have been forced to do, the legislature's establishment of a procedure to reimburse the utilities did not violate the Colorado Constitution. The board's determination of the boundaries of an improvement district and the extent to which a property was specially benefitted by an improvement were matters left to the discretion of municipal authorities. That special benefit was the &quot;compensation&quot; constitutionally required when private property was taken. This was not a prohibited taking for a private use; the assessment served a public purpose. The Act's notice provision was constitutionally adequate. The assessment was not an appropriation, Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 34, and the Act was not an unlawful delegation of power, Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 35. Section 34 applied only to state funds and the Act reserved power to the improvement district.</SPAN></P>

The items were later identified as stolen from a house while the owner was out of town. Defendant was charged with second-degree burglary, theft, and conspiracy to commit second-degree burglary and theft. At trial, the trial court instructed the jury that the unexplained possession of stolen property recently after a burglary raised an inference of burglary. Defendant was convicted of second-degree burglary. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the trial court's jury instruction did not violate defendant's due process rights. Once the presumption was established, the court found that defendant was required to present evidence in rebuttal, which could be independent of his own testimony. The court found there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find defendant guilty of second-degree burglary and the trial court properly found that the prosecution met its burden of establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt for each element of the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an original proceeding, petitioner sought relief in the nature of mandamus to compel the reinstatement of bail. He claimed that bail was revoked without cause and that he was denied the constitutional right to bail guaranteed by Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 19. The court had previously issued a rule to show cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's bail was revoked at a preliminary hearing when the trial court determined that probable cause existed. No notice had been given that bail would be revoked at that hearing, although the trial court had imposed a condition in the bail order that it would be revoked if probable cause was shown to exist. Defendant sought a writ of mandamus to compel the trial court to reinstate bail. The court granted relief, holding that probable cause was not a standard for denial of bail as provided by Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 19. Under that provision, bail could be denied if the state met the burden of establishing at the bail hearing that the &quot;proof is evident or the presumption great.&quot; The hearing in this case was not a bail hearing so defendant had no notice that bail would be revoked. Furthermore, the probable cause standard used by the trial court was less stringent than the standard imposed by the state constitution. The trial court also erred by essentially finding defendant guilty at the preliminary hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court made absolute its rule to show cause and directed the lower court to reinstate bail on the conditions previously set, but to strike the condition that bail shall be revoked when probable cause is shown.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested after he went to the home of his ex-wife and shot and killed her new husband. As an officer placed him in handcuffs following his arrest, defendant answered a question concerning the location of the gun. On appeal, defendant argued, among other things, that the trial court's failure to charge the jury on voluntary manslaughter was error that was subject to plain error review. He also asserted that the admission of statements made at the time of his arrest was error on the grounds that the lack of Miranda warnings was a violation of his Fifth Amendment rights. The court, in affirming the conviction, disagreed. Noting that there was no evidence of a provocation on the part of the victim that could have excited an irresistible passion in a reasonable person, as required under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-104 (1973), the court first found that an instruction on voluntary manslaughter was not warranted. Next, the court found that defendant's response to the officer's question did not fall within the ambit of Miranda because it was not a custodial interrogation but merely the act of a prudent officer who wished to secure the weapon in order to avoid further violence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant then brought a motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to Rule 35(b), contending that he was entitled to a new trial due to ineffectiveness of counsel. The trial court denied defendant's motion and he sought review. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that the motion was properly denied. As to ineffectiveness of counsel, defendant offered no evidence to support his allegations, or further, to show that he had not been afforded a fair trial, or to reveal that he had a meritorious defense which should have been presented, or that the manner in which he was represented was contrary to his expressed wishes and requests. Significantly, defendant did not testify at the Rule 35(b) hearing, which indicated that defendant knew that he waived his attorney-client privilege and was reluctant to testify. In addition, the fact that the public defender was appointed by the state supreme court did not create such a nexus as would violate the due process provisions, the separation of powers, or the right a defendant has to a fair trial, under the Colorado and United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The passenger and the driver borrowed a car and decided to drive the car at excessive rates of speed. The passenger did not object to the manner in which the driver was operating the vehicle.

The trial court's order was based on the Colorado Guest Statute and a finding that the driver's conduct was not willful and wanton. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that a directed verdict was entirely proper under the circumstances. The court rejected the argument that the Statute was unconstitutional on the basis of established precedent. The court examined the definition of willful and wanton acts and omissions and determined that the trial court did not err in finding that the driver's actions did not constitute a willful and wanton disregard of the rights of another.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The first trial court granted the prosecution's motion without a hearing to obtain discovery regarding, inter alia, the nature of the intended defense and defendant's expert witnesses.

In a consolidated proceeding, the court made Rules 16II(b) and (c) absolute. The court noted that U.S. Const. amend.

The court found that Rules 16II(b) and (c) did not remove defendant's right to utilize the shield of silence provided by the United States and Colorado constitutions. The court remanded the first case to the trial court with instructions because the first trial court did not consider the effect of its decision on the constitutional rights of defendant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The People appealed a judgment of the District Court, Tenth Judicial District (Colorado), which dismissed drug charges against defendant on constitutional grounds. Defendant was charged under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-5-20 (1963) with conspiracy to sell and the sale of a narcotic drug with intent to induce or aid another to unlawfully use or possess and under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-5-2 (1963) with conspiracy to sell narcotic drugs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court determined that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-5-20 (1963) was violative of the Equal Protection Clause because there were harsher penalties assessed for the sale of a narcotic drug with intent under &sect; 48-5-20 than under the &quot;simple sale&quot; statute, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-5-2 (1963), whereas the conduct proscribed under each section was identical. The court noted that the trial court did not have the benefit of its recent decision upholding the constitutionality of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-5-20 (1963) on the basis of its conclusion that it proscribed different conduct than Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-5-2 (1963). The court noted that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-5-20(1)(a), (c) (1963) were specific intent statutes requiring proof of specific intent to aid or induce another to use or possess a narcotic drug, which was not required for a conviction under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-5-2 (1963). Section 48-5-2 was aimed at the simple sale of narcotics. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-5-20(1)(a), (c) (1963) were directed at drug pushers who specifically intended to aid another to unlawfully use a narcotic drug and was consistent with the apparent legislative purpose of diminishing the spread of narcotic addiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the ruling of the trial court and remanded the cause with directions to vacate the order of the trial court dismissing the charges against defendant and to reinstate the indictment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction was based on a sale of movie tickets to view the film &quot;Deep Throat.&quot; The primary issue on appeal was whether the Colorado statutes that defined and regulated obscenity could pass constitutional muster. The state argued that if the statutes were unconstitutional then the court should construe or judicially rewrite the Colorado statutes so as to comply with federal constitutional standards. On appeal, the court declined to construe or judicially rewrite the Colorado statute so as to comply with the federal constitutional standards, reversed defendant's conviction, and dismissed the charges in the case. In so ruling, the court determined that the statutory definition of &quot;obscene&quot; in Colorado was drawn overly broad in that it obviously included activities which could be described or depicted in some context other than an erotic one. The court ruled that the statute failed to describe an &quot;ultimate sexual act,&quot; as suggested in Miller, a United States Supreme Court case, and that this lack of specificity rendered the Colorado definition of obscenity constitutionally defective as measured by part (b) of the Miller standards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction of promoting obscenity was reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court with directions to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

The injunction was denied and after the property owner failed to redeem the property after the sale the judgment creditor redeemed the property and was issued a deed.

The property owner challenged the constitutionality of the sale and the application of the excess proceeds and the court reversed as to the application of the proceeds.

Defendant challenged his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought to reverse the conviction, contending that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-5-20(1)(a), (c) (1963) was unconstitutional, and contending that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his guilt. The court held the statute to be constitutional, but agreed with defendant that the evidence was not sufficient to support the verdicts of guilty. The court reversed defendant's conviction. Defendant argued that the statute was violative of equal protection because the offense was the same offense as that defined under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-5-2 (1963), and the two statutes prescribed grossly disparate penalties. The court disagreed that the offenses were identical offenses for which disparate penalties were assessed. As for the evidentiary problem, the court found that the prosecution failed to show that defendant sold narcotic drugs with the specific intent to induce or aid any person to use or possess the narcotics sold to them. On the contrary, the evidence showed that specific intent was lacking. Both sale transactions were initiated by the undercover police and their agent, who sought out defendant and solicited the buys from him. There was no affirmative act shown by defendant.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 40-1-510(1)(f) was unconstitutional with respect to judgments that were final on the effective date of the statute. The court had concluded that it encroached on the governor's exclusive power to grant a commutation after conviction pursuant to Colo. Const. art. IV, &sect; 7 and thus violated the doctrine of separation of powers embodied in Colo. Const. art. III. The court held that, because the trial court had no jurisdiction to deal with the matter at all, no error occurred in the manner in which the hearing was conduct. Moreover, the reduction of defendant's sentence was a nullity and was required to be set aside.</SPAN></P>

The court made the rule to show cause absolute and directed the district court and judge to deny bail. The court reasoned that pursuant to Colo. Const. art.

In addition, the court determined that there were offenses of a nature as to which a state properly could refuse to make provision for a right to bail.

Defendant contended that the Department of Revenue had no power under &sect; 75-2-1 et seq. to promulgate the regulation because it amounted to an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. The court acknowledged that the legislature could not delegate the power to make or define a law, but that it could delegate the power to determine the applicable facts and situations to which a law applied. The question was whether, in delegating its authority, the legislature completed its job of making the law by established a definite plan or framework for the law's operation. The court held that it did not abdicate its function when it described what job was required to be done, who must do it, and the scope of his authority. Observing that the legislation specified a definite plan of for the enforcement of the Liquor Code, the court concluded that the regulation was clearly within the power delegated to the to the Department of Revenue and a proper exercise of the authority delegated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court dissolved the investors' writ of attachment and garnishment that froze the commodities brokers' accounts pending resolution of the investors' action for breach contract, conversion, fraud, and securities laws violations. On appeal, the investors asserted that the pre-judgment garnishment did not violate the constitutional prohibition against pre-judgment wage garnishments without prior notice and opportunity to be heard. The commodities brokers alleged that the Colo. R. Civ. P. 102, 103 procedures violated their procedural due process rights. The court reversed and concluded that the pre-judgment garnishment procedure comported with the Due Process Clause. The garnishment action involved bank accounts, not wages. Colo. R. Civ. P. 102(c) mandated that the investors put up a bond to protect the commodities brokers, who had a right to obtain an immediate hearing to contest the writ. The commodities brokers were not at the mercy of creditors and court functionaries because there was judicial control of the garnishment process. Therefore, Colorado provided sufficient procedural protections so that its pre-judgment attachment and garnishment procedure was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Informations charged defendants with felony theft, conspiracy to commit theft, aggravated robbery, and conspiracy to commit aggravated robbery. The trial court granted defendants' motion to suppress evidence that had been obtained by wiretapping, and the People appealed. The court reversed the trial court's ruling. The court held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-24-2 et seq. (1971) (as amended by 1972 Colo. Sess. Laws 45) was not unconstitutional as an invasion of a defendants' privacy. The court found that the trial court correctly ruled that the facts that were set forth in the affidavit that was attached to the original wiretap application were sufficient to support a determination of probable cause. The court also found that the evidence could be used regarding crimes other than those that were designated in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-24-2(1) (1971). The court concluded, however, the trial court incorrectly held the application for supplemental use of the evidence under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-24-2(15) (1971) had to be signed personally by the district attorney. The court determined that the trial court also applied an incorrect standard for exhaustion of normal investigative procedures.</SPAN></P>

He argued that he was a first offender and that the trial court improperly relied on hearsay and opinion in the presentence investigation report.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with sale of narcotics with intent and conspiracy to sell. As a result of plea bargaining, he pled guilty to the lesser count of sale of a narcotic drug without intent. The authorized sentence for a first offender was 2 to 15 years in prison. The trial court ordered a presentence investigation. The contents of the report were the subject of some dispute concerning police allegations that defendant was a substantial heroin dealer. At sentencing, defendant testified and requested leniency. He challenged the sentence imposed. The People argued that the court lacked authority to review the sentence because &sect; 40-1-509 was unconstitutional. The court found that the statute was constitutional, but it affirmed the sentence. There was no question of the propriety of the appellate proceeding under the statute. Defendant was convicted of a class 2 felony, and his sentence exceeded by three years the two-year minimum applicable. A review of the record convinced the court that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the sentence, which was well within the statutory limits for a first offender, and no mitigating circumstances were presented.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property sought to be condemned was the church parking lot, which was for the use of parishioners in the various activities of the church. The church building was not being condemned because it had been designated as an historical site. The church argued that the parking lot was necessary to its operation because many parishioners would cease or at least be discouraged from attending church. The condemnor admitted that at least some interference with the church functioning, albeit temporary, would result from the taking. The court had issued a show cause order, which it made absolute by directing the district court to vacate the order of immediate possession. The court found that the district court had a duty to weigh and balance the competing interests, public and religious. However, there was no evidence presented or considered by the district court concerning the relative interest of the condemnor under its urban renewal authority as against that of the church under its constitutional right of free exercise of religion.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion and subsequent renewals of the motion during trial and on a motion for a new trial. A jury returned a verdict for defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that: 1) previous case law that upheld the guest statute against challenges to its constitutionality on equal protection grounds remained valid law; 2) plaintiff had not met its burden of persuasion that the statute was unreasonable and arbitrary or that the issue of the statute's constitutionality should have been reconsidered; and 3) the doctrine of stare decisis required that the court exercise judicial restraint and not overturn caselaw upholding the constitutionality of the statute, as such was best left to the legislature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to annexation by the city, the property owner maintained a six-space mobile home park and a limited salvage yard on his property.

The property owner, however, contended that he had the right to extend or enlarge the nonconforming uses and that the denial of the right was arbitrary, unreasonable, and confiscatory. The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the city. The court concluded that the property owner failed to meet his burden of proving the unconstitutionality of the city zoning ordinance by clear and convincing evidence. The court rejected the property owner's assertion that the enforcement of the zoning code in such a manner as to limit the expansion constituted an invalid exercise of the city's police power. The court found no evidence that the challenged zoning was arbitrary or discriminatory.

Rather, the court held that one's rights of freedom of association and of privacy must yield to valid zoning regulations enacted under the authority of a city's police power.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an original proceeding, the State filed a petition that sought an order of reinstatement of criminal charges against defendant for sale of a narcotic drug with intent to induce or aid another to unlawfully use or possess such narcotic drug, conspiracy to do the same, and possession of narcotics, that had been dismissed by respondents, district judge and district court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A three-count information was filed against defendant. Subsequently the criminal charges were dismissed, and the State sought an order to have the charges reinstated. The issue raised was whether the district court, which had previously found that there was probable cause to believe that defendant had committed a crime, had authority to later order the charges be dismissed or reduced based on the preliminary hearing. The court held that the district court did not have such authority. Further, the court found that there was no provision for rehearing on or reconsideration of a ruling on completion of a preliminary hearing. Thus, the court concluded that the district court did not have jurisdiction to later reopen the matter after bind-over and to reduce the charges. Therefore, the court ordered that the information be reinstated and the cause set for arraignment and trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to the Act, the City and County of Denver annexed two parcels of land located in Adams County that the landowners owned.

Thereafter, the landowners filed an action challenging the district court's jurisdiction in Adams County on the basis that suit should have been filed in the Denver District Court. The court found that &sect; 15(2) of the Act provided that proceedings to review an annexation were to be instituted in any district court having jurisdiction of the county in which the annexed territory was located. The court held that the Act intended that review proceedings could be brought in either the district court of the county in which the land was situated prior to annexation or in the district court of the county in which the land was located after annexation. The court found also that &sect; 15(1)(b) of the Act provided that the district court was to be presided over by an appointed judge from another county, noting that this provision prevented the inequity of requiring a judge to rule against the county where he resided.</SPAN></P>

The debtor's class action requested the declaration that the statutes for the issuance of certificates of title and registration to repossessed motor vehicles were unconstitutional, and she requested an injunction against the issuance of a new certificate of title. The court affirmed the contested judgment because the issuance of a new title did not deprive the debtor any substantial property rights. The court held that due process did not require that the debtor receive notice or an opportunity to be heard before the department. The department's issuance of the title certificate to the creditor involved no deprivation of due process to the debtor as contemplated by the Fourteenth Amendment or the Colorado Constitution. The court determined that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3-15(3) (1963) was part of a constitutional taxing scheme. The debtor was not deprived of any property right by the enforcement.</SPAN></P>

After a bench trial, the holder was awarded judgment of $ 1,638.84 plus costs and attorney's fees of $ 1,500. On appeal, the debtor asserted that (1) the repossession and sale of the security was an unconstitutional taking of his property without due process of law and (2) the award of $ 1,500 for attorney's fees was excessive as a matter of law. Finding no merit with either of these contentions, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that: Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with felony non-support of his three children from 1968 through 1972. Because the statute applied only to men, the trial court found it to be violative of Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 29 (1972), commonly known as the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which became effective in 1973. The trial court, therefore, dismissed the information charging defendant with felony non-support. On appeal, the court found that the trial court erred in applying the ERA to prohibit the prosecution of the alleged criminal conduct that occurred prior to the effective date of the amendment, reasoning that there was no language in the ERA from which an intention appeared to make the amendment retrospective in its operation. The court also held that the felony nonsupport statute did not discriminate against fathers or deny them equal protection of the laws. The court reasoned that protection of the health and welfare of minor children was a legitimate end, and the means to achieve that end, imposing criminal liability on defaulting fathers alone, was founded on a sufficient rationality to sustain the classification.</SPAN></P>

The trial court affirmed the Department's action, and the applicant appealed. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that, under Colorado law, the only method of legal adoption, except equitable adoption in factual situations involving succession to an estate, was through the Children's Code. The court concluded that the burden of statutory adoption did not deny the applicant equal protection of the laws because it bore a reasonable relationship to a legitimate government interest.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 115-9-5(2), and also revoked the applicant's contract permit, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 115-11-10. The District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado) affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commission granted the applicant a permit for common carrier authority but canceled the applicant's contract authority not coextensive with the common carrier authority granted by the commission.

Stat. &sect; 115-9-5(2), the commission was not required demonstrate that existing service was inadequate before certifying a common carrier. Adequacy or inadequacy of service was no longer the controlling determinate but, instead, the controlling factor was public interest. The commission found that the applicant was completely qualified and fit to render the common carrier service for which it sought certification. Thus, that portion of the judgment affirming the certification of the applicant was affirmed. However, because the commission did not give notice or hold a hearing, it had no authority to revoke part of the applicant's contract permit.  Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 115-11-10.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff telephone companies petitioned for certiorari to review the judgment of the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado), which upheld the assessments and penalties made by defendant state director of revenue under the state's sales and use tax laws, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 138-5-2, 138-5-34 (1963).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The telephone companies contended that they were exempt from the sales and use tax laws, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 138-5-2, 138-5-34 (1963), on their purchases of telephone instruments, station apparatus, cable, switching equipment, and other items used directly in providing telephone service to its customers. The court noted that the items at issue did not become a constituent part of the service rendered. The court held that the processing clauses of the sales and use tax laws, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 138-5-2(14), 138-5-34(7) (1963), when applied to businesses providing a service, did not exempt purchases of telephone equipment that were used by the telephone company in providing telephone service. Alternatively, the telephone companies contended that the sales and use tax laws were unconstitutional because they denied equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that the legislature could classify for the purpose of taxation if the classification was reasonable. There was an ample basis for finding a legitimate state interest in treating differently those who awarded possession under a lease or contract as against the telephone companies, who did not.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed that the judgment of the trial court to uphold the tax assessment and penalties of the state director of revenue was a proper disposition on the issues presented. There was no deprivation of the telephone companies' constitutional rights. There was also no error in the imposition of interest penalties on the tax deficiencies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant inmate was convicted of a drug violation. While his appeal was pending, the statute under which he was sentenced was amended to reduce the penalty for violation thereof. After his conviction was affirmed, the inmate moved, under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-1-510(1)(f) (1963), for reduction of his sentence to conform to the new provisions. The District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado) denied the motion. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court stated that it had declared unconstitutional &sect; 40-1-510(1)(f) as an invasion of the Governor's power to grant a commutation after conviction, as provided in Colo. Const. art. IV, &sect; 7, and also as a violation of the doctrine of separation of powers, as embodied in Colo. Const. art. III. The inmate also urged that, without benefit of &sect; 40-1-510(1)(f), mitigation of penalties might be had because the amendatory legislation took effect during the pendency of an appeal. The court rejected that contention on the ground that, because the inmate had exhausted his appellate remedy of appeal and his conviction had become final before he had filed his motion, the trial court was without jurisdiction to entertain his motion for relief. The court also rejected the inmate's contention that should relief from his sentence be denied him, he was effectively deprived of his constitutional right to equal protection of the laws. The court stated that equal protection required only that those who had committed the same offense should be subject to the same criminal sanctions in effect at the time the offense was committed. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty to simple robbery and was sentenced to a term of not less than seven nor more than 14 years in prison. Defendant did not appeal. Several years later, defendant filed a motion for post-conviction review of his sentence, under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 510(1)(f) (1971 Perm.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that &sect; 40-4-301, which became effective after his conviction, reclassified simple robbery as a class four felony and, under &sect; 40-1-105, reduced the penalty to not less than one nor more than 10 years. Defendant also sought credit for time served in presentence confinement. The court affirmed. First, &sect; 40-1-510(1)(f) had been declared unconstitutional, and the trial court was without jurisdiction to grant post-conviction relief from the sentence imposed. Second, neither rule nor statute required that the trial court grant defendant credit for time served prior to sentencing, and it was clear that there was no constitutional right to credit for presentence confinement. The record was silent on whether the sentencing judge gave defendant credit for time served in jail prior to sentencing. Under the circumstances, it had to be presumed that the sentencing judge acted properly in imposing defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that &sect; 68-1-1 was unconstitutional because it denied to him equal protection of the laws. The State Legislature fixed the felony-misdemeanor dividing line at $ 100 for many crimes, such as thefts. However, the dividing line between felonies and misdemeanors was $ 50 for procuring food or accommodations with the intent to defraud as provided in &sect; 68-1-1. Defendant argued that there was no rational reason for convicting him of a felony for defrauding an innkeeper of $ 54 whereas he would have been convicted of only a misdemeanor had he taken $ 54 worth of groceries from a store without paying for them. The court affirmed. The court found that (1) defendant did not meet his burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of the statute beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) the trial court's reason in upholding the classification, that the dividing line was set at $ 50 because the usual motel bill for one night was under that amount, was a rational reason for the difference in treatment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Colorado Civil Rights Commission (Commission) held that petitioner teacher was dismissed from his employment with respondent public school in violation of the Colorado Antidiscrimination Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 80-21-6(2) (1963, Supp. 1969). The teacher sought review of the Colorado Court of Appeal's affirmation of the district court's judgment that the teacher was not discharged because of his religious beliefs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The teacher was fired because he missed work on days that were not recognized as religious holidays by the public school. The teacher had a hearing before the Colorado Teacher Tenure Panel (Panel), which determined that the teacher was not discriminated against and that there was cause for his termination. The teacher then filed an action with the Commission. The court affirmed the appellate court and held that the claim before the Commission was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The court held that res judicata barred the action because 1) the procedure set forth in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 123-18-17(7) (1963, 1967 Supp.) afforded the teacher due process, 2) the teacher did not seek judicial review of the adverse recommendation of the Panel and his subsequent dismissal in the school board, and 3) the teacher raised or could have raised all the issues in this action in the hearing before the Panel and on judicial review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the appellate court, which held that the public school did not discriminate against the teacher when he was discharged, was modified to correct the lower court's erroneous determination that the doctrine of res judicata did not apply, and as modified, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an original proceeding petitioner state challenged a ruling by respondent, the District Court for the Fourth Judicial District (Colorado), which held Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-3-102(1)(d) (1963, Perm. Supp. 1971), a portion of the homicide statute, unconstitutional on the ground that it was facially void for vagueness. The court issued an order to show cause why a writ of mandamus should not issue directing respondent to reinstate the charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the challenged portion of the first-degree murder statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-3-102(1)(d) (1963, Perm. Supp. 1971) was not void for vagueness. The constitutional test for vagueness was that if a statute gave a fair description of the conduct forbidden and men of common intelligence could readily apprehend the statute's meaning and application, it would not be declared unconstitutional for vagueness. Here, the second-degree murder statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-3-103, provided, in part, that a person committed the crime of murder in the second degree if he caused the death of a person intentionally, but without premeditation. A person committed the crime of murder in the first degree if under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life, he intentionally engaged in conduct that created a grave risk of death to a person other than himself, and thereby caused the death of another. The clear distinction was that one was directed toward the intentional, though not premeditated, taking of a particular life, the other directed to the intentional endangering of human life.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the statute at issue was constitutional and not void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff licensed driver refused to submit to chemical sobriety tests. As a result, under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-5-30 (1963), defendant Department of Revenue, Motor Vehicle Division suspended his license for a six-month period running from the date of the departmental hearing. The driver sought appellate review in the District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado), which held that the law was unconstitutional. The Department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court held that the statute in question was unconstitutional and held that it violated constitutional principles of equal protection. The trial court interpreted the statute as requiring a six month suspension of an operator's license to run from the date of the hearing for Colorado residents but from the date of the violation for non-residents. The court held that the trial court erroneously interpreted the law. The court held that the statute should have been read as requiring residents with operator licenses and non-residents with licenses who failed to take chemical sobriety tests to have their licenses suspended for six months from the date of their departmental hearing. The court held that unlicensed drivers who were residents and non-residents were to be denied issuance of a license for six months from the date of their violations. The court also held that a court must presume that legislation was constitutional unless it was proven otherwise beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decision of the trial court and remanded the case for a determination of the driver's other allegations of error.</SPAN></P>
