</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, candidates for the position of member of the Democratic Party county committee in various election districts within the City of Amsterdam, New York, filed designating petitions that were invalidated by respondents, the Commissioners of the Board of Elections of the County of Montgomery, New York. Several candidates filed amended petitions that were rejected by the Board. The candidates sought review of the Board's determinations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidates filed designating petitions that were invalidated by the Commissioners because the insertion in the heading of each petition of the month and day as the date of the next primary election was improper and incomplete. The court held that the lack of a complete date of the primary election was a fatal defect that mandated the dismissal of the candidates' petitions. The date of the primary election was specifically prescribed by N.Y. Elect. Law &sect; 6-132(1), and strict compliance with the content provisions of &sect; 6-132(1) was required. A month and day, without a year, was not a date. To comply with &sect; 6-132(1), the day, month, and year had to appear upon the petition. Notice to the candidates of the invalidity of their petitions was not required, as the invalidity was apparent on the face of the petitions. The constitutionality of &sect; 6-132 was not before the court, as notice was not provided to the Attorney-General of the State of New York as required by N.Y. C.P.L.R. 1012(b). The amended petitions were not timely served, and N.Y. Elect. Law &sect; 16-100 did not provide the court with authority to make such orders as justice required.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Elections -- Designating Petitions -- Incomplete Date of Primary Election</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Designating petitions filed by petitioners, candidates for the party position of member of the county committee of the Democratic Party are invalid on the grounds that the insertion in the heading of the petition of the date of September 10 as the date when the next primary election is to be held was improper since the year 1985 did not follow September 10; Election Law &sect; 6-132 mandates that a designating petition contain the date of the primary election, and strict compliance with the content provisions of the statute is required; &quot;September 10&quot; without the year 1985 is not a date; the lack of a complete date is fatal and mandates dismissal of said petitions.  Moreover, petitioners Diane Morrone and Ronald Wierzbicki were properly challenged notwithstanding the fact that the objections were filed against Diane Marrone and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Robert</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wierzbicki; there is no contention that notice was not timely, that the required information was not set forth or that petitioners were prejudiced; further, notice to candidates is not vital&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  when the petitions are invalid on their face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Elections -- Designating Petitions</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Amended petitions served by petitioners, candidates for the office of member of the county committee of the Democratic Party whose original designating petitions were invalidated, requesting a write-in primary are dismissed; the amended petitions were not timely served (Election Law &sect; 16-102 [2]), and Election Law &sect; 16-100 does not provide the court with the authority to make such orders as justice requires.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with the crime of sexual abuse in the second degree, a class A misdemeanor. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charge against him on the ground that the information was insufficient on its face because the acts alleged did not constitute a crime. Defendant was alleged to have repeatedly rubbed the leg of an 11-year-old girl.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The information stated that defendant intentionally and repeatedly rubbed his hand on the victim's leg without authority or permission after being told not to do so. Defendant contended that the information was insufficient on its face because the leg did not constitute an &quot;intimate part&quot; within the meaning of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 130.60 and its definitional section, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 130.00(3). The People argued that the information was sufficient on its face and that any insufficiency was cured by alleging in a bill of particulars a touching of the inner thigh. The court found that in essence, defendant was urging the court to limit the purview of the statute to the anatomically sexual parts of the body. After examining the legislative history and prior case law, the court held that the leg was an &quot;intimate&quot; part of the body and that the information was sufficient on its face. The court further held that to determine if a part was &quot;intimate&quot;, one must examine three factors: what area of the body was touched, what was the manner of the touching, and under what circumstances did the touching take place.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the charge.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sexual Abuse -- Touching &quot;Intimate&quot; Part of Victim's Body</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An information charging defendant with sexual abuse in the second degree, alleging that he repeatedly rubbed the leg of an 11-year-old girl prior and subsequent to her demands that he cease, is sufficient on its face and need not be amended to allege that defendant stroked the girl's inner thigh, since under the circumstances presented the leg is an &quot;intimate&quot; part of the body; in defining &quot;sexual contact&quot; to be the touching of &quot;the sexual or other intimate parts&quot; of the victim, Penal Law &sect; 130.00 (3) must be read broadly and not in an unduly limited fashion which would prohibit punishing certain types of physically intrusive behavior which offends society's general sense of decency, propriety and morality. Accordingly, to determine if a part of the body is &quot;intimate&quot;, three factors must be examined: what area of the body is touched; what is the manner of touching, and under what circumstances did the touching take place.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with various A level misdemeanors, all of which were triable before a judge without a jury pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.15 (Reclassification Law) and N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 340.40. She filed a motion seeking an order granting a trial by jury, claiming that the Reclassification Law was unconstitutional under both the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 155.25, 140.15, 145.00, and 140.35. Under the Reclassification Law defendant was not entitled to a jury trial despite the fact that possible penalties included 6 months in jail and a $ 1000 fine. The court rejected a challenge to the law's constitutionality. Holding that a strong presumption of constitutionality attached to the law and that defendant was required to show unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt, the court found that there was no right to a jury trial on a petty offense, that whether any particular offense carried with it the right to jury trial depended on the authorized penalty, not on the possibility of social stigma or other collateral consequences, and that neither the possible 6-month sentence nor the $ 1000 fine mandated a finding that a jury trial was required. The court also rejected defendant's equal protection challenge, holding that the statutory discrimination between first-time offenders and recidivists was not irrational and in fact was directly and rationally related to the legitimate goal of relieving demands on judicial resources.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the constitutionality of the Reclassification Law. The court denied defendant's motion in all respects.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new &quot;Reclassification Law&quot; (amending Penal Law &sect; 70.15; CPL 340.40), which retains the right to jury trial for certain &quot;serious&quot; A misdemeanors for which the maximum authorized penalty is one year while denying the right to a jury trial for other &quot;petty&quot; A misdemeanors which are subject to a maximum penalty of six months' imprisonment for first offenders and a $ 1,000 fine, is not unconstitutional since the Legislature's establishment of a six-month standard is the determinative gauge of the inherent &quot;gravity&quot; of an offense and it would be an &quot;improper usurpation of the legislative function&quot; for a judge to make an independent evaluation of the seriousness of the crime to determine if a charged must be tried before a jury; the possible imposition of a $ 1,000 fine for the category of &quot;petty&quot; crimes does not implicate the right to a jury trial even though Federal law appears to establish a six-month/$ 500 benchmark for &quot;petty crimes&quot; (18 USC &sect; 1 [3]) since the six-month benchmark is far more important than the obsolete $ 500 standard set in 1930 and the court should not disregard&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the clear legislative intent of the new law; the disparate treatment of first offenders and recidivists under the new law is directly and rationally related to the legitimate goal of providing speedy and inexpensive nonjury adjudications and the fact that some anomalies might result from the legislative scheme of reclassification is not sufficient to overcome the presumption of rationality that attaches to the new statute; accordingly, since defendant is charged with the &quot;petty&quot; crimes of petit larceny, criminal trespass in the second degree, criminal mischief in the fourth degree and possession of burglar's tools, she is not entitled to a jury trial. </SPAN></P>

Defendants filed motions for reinspection of the grand jury minutes and for dismissal of the indictment on the ground that the proceedings before the grand jury were rendered defective by submission of a time-barred offense and evidence of the same, which was legally insufficient.

Defendant was charged with theft of services under &sect; 165.15(4). Defendant moved to dismiss on several grounds. The court found defendant guilty of theft of services and held that &sect; 165.15(4) was not unconstitutional because 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 605 did not preempt the state from enacting legislation to deter the theft of services in the telecommunication field. The court ruled that the state had jurisdiction over defendant's offense even if the ultimate use of the decoder was to be used outside of the state. The court held that N.Y.

The court ruled that a legal or factual impossibility defense to complete the act was not significant because, under &sect; 165.15(4), defendant's mere attempt to sell an unauthorized decoder violated the statute.

The theft of services statute, insofar as it proscribes the sale of decoders to be used for the unauthorized interception of encoded cable television signals (Penal Law &sect; 165.15 [4]), is not unconstitutional because of Federal preemption of the telecommunication field as it relates to defendant's 1984 sale of a decoder instrument to a private investigator and an undercover detective since the 1984 amendment to the Federal statute stating that nothing in the Federal statute is intended to prevent the States from enacting legislation to deter the theft of services in the telecommunication field (47 USC &sect; 605), is a curative act that may be viewed as an expression of congressional intent on the issue as to the theft of services in the telecommunication field prior to the 1984 amendment and may thus be given retroactive effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Having entered a guilty plea to robbery in the first degree, defendant challenged his status as a predicate felon and the constitutionality of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.06(1)(b)(v), which extended the 10-year period within which predicate felonies had to have been committed by a period equal to the time of defendant's confinement between the commission of those predicate felonies and the execution of sentence thereon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant denied that he was the person convicted on prior felonies as alleged by the state and contended that the tolling provisions of &sect; 70.06(1)(b)(v) violated the Equal Protection Clause: if defendant had been able to afford to post bond following a certain arrest he would not be subject to enhanced punishment pursuant to &sect; 70.06(1)(b)(v). The court found that the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was the individual convicted on the prior felonies. Nevertheless, the court determined to sentence defendant as a first-time offender because the court agreed that &sect; 70.06(1)(b)(v) was unconstitutional as applied to defendant. Inclusion of the period of defendant's preconviction detention according to the tolling provisions of the predicate felony offender statute served to punish defendant in consequence of his indigency. The Equal Protection Clause was violated when an accused served more time on sentences imposed merely because he was unable to make bail due to insufficient funds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held in favor of the state in part, finding that defendant was the individual convicted on the prior felonies, and held in favor of defendant in part, finding that defendant should be sentenced as a first-time offender.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The garnishor recovered a default judgment against the garnishee for the sum of $ 25,568. The garnishor commenced judgment enforcement proceedings by serving a series of restraining notices pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 5222 on the garnishee's banks. As a result, $ 96,372 was restrained from the garnishee's use. The court granted the garnishor's motion for summary judgment, and denied the garnishee's motion for summary judgment. The court held that the garnishee failed to make any allegation that he was not given the requisite notice of the restraining order, nor did the garnishee allege the unconstitutionality of the restraining order. The garnishee also failed to plead any allegation of malicious intent on the part of the garnishor to deprive the garnishee of its money. Absent a showing of malicious intent by the garnishor, no cause of action existed. The court granted the garnishee the right to replead its complaint.</SPAN></P>

Malicious use of the statute does not render it unconstitutional; moreover, the statute's notice requirements minimize intrusion, as the debtor may promptly get an order directing satisfaction of the judgment and release of the balance of the restrained moneys.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayers filed an action that challenged the constitutionality of a statutory funding scheme for the development of state correctional facilities pursuant to N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 11, which was dismissed on respondent Commissioner of General Service's motion for summary judgment. The taxpayers filed a motion for reargument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature enacted a series of statutes designed to finance the construction of new correctional facilities, collectively known as the Prison Construction Act, which authorized the State Urban Development Corporation (UDC) to issue bonds, the proceeds of which were to have been used to repay the Department of Correctional Services. The commissioner was then authorized to lease the facilities from the UDC and in turn sublet them to the department. The taxpayers filed a petition that challenged the Act's constitutionality pursuant to N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 11 on the ground that the Act incurred long-term debts on behalf of the state without voter approval. The commissioner brought a motion for summary judgment, which was granted, and the court granted the taxpayers' motion for reargument, then affirmed. The court held that the taxpayers failed to show that the state incurred long-term debt under the Act because it was the UDC that issued and was obligated under the bonds, not the State. Furthermore, &sect; 7(1) of the Act gave the state the choice to enter into the leases with the UDC, rather than having required the state to do so.</SPAN></P>

All preexisting non-compliant billboards had to be removed within two years from the date of enactment of the Town of Carmel, N.Y., Zoning Ordinance. The advertiser had three billboard structures within the Town's limits at locations not falling within those proscribed by the Town of Carmel, N.Y., Zoning Ordinance. The court held that Town of Carmel, N.Y., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 386.2, which limited billboards to the place of business, and Town of Carmel, N.Y., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 63-11A(1)(d), which required removal of pre-existing non-compliant billboards, were unconstitutional and, thus, unenforceable. Though the town had the authority to regulate billboards for the purposes of protecting the public health and safety or for aesthetic purposes alone, it had to do so in a manner that did not infringe on the advertiser's First Amendment rights.

The court held that petitioners failed to present the necessary requirements for a declaratory judgment and dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. However, the court reviewed the merits of the complaint due to the importance of the issues to the criminal justice system and because it presented a recurring problem. The court held that the statutes did not violate due process or equal protection rights under the United States and New York Constitutions. The court held that commercial sexual activity did not come within the sphere of protected privacy. The court held that there was no recognized fundamental right to engage in commercial sex or prostitution and that there was a rational relationship between the statutes and legitimate state interests. The court held that equal protection was not violated because there was a marital exemption for the crime of prostitution and there was a rational basis to discriminate between married and unmarried persons under the statutes.</SPAN></P>

The county did not pay the attorney. The court held that N.Y. Comp.

The statute had supremacy and the rule was unconstitutional. Failure to secure approval of the supervising judge was not fatal. No notice of claim was required under N.Y. County Law &sect; 52. The statute authorized a special proceeding to enforce the award, which was properly commended by order to show cause, and a plenary action was not required.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent father filed a motion to dismiss the paternity petition of petitioner mother upon the grounds that more than five years had elapsed between the date of the child's birth and the date the petition was filed and, therefore, the petition was barred by N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother conceded that the application of &sect; 517 would have barred the petition. However, the mother contended that &sect; 517 was unconstitutional because the statute provided shorter limitation periods for mothers who brought paternity proceedings from that for fathers who brought paternity proceedings and thus denied the mother equal protection under the law. Because the mother and the adjudicated father of a child born out of wedlock had equal rights in relation to their child, the court could find no basis for providing different periods during which each might assert its rights. The state's interest in avoiding stale or fraudulent claims could be equally served by a gender-neutral statute. Where the state's compensatory and ameliorative purposes were as well served by a gender-neutral classification as one that gender classified and therefore carried with it the baggage of sexual stereotypes, the state could not be permitted to classify on the basis of sex.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family Court Act &sect; 517 (a), which provides for a five-year limitations period for paternity proceedings commenced by the mother of an illegitimate child, is unconstitutional and, while no determination is made as to the proper period, it is not less than the 10-year period given to public welfare officials; consequently, the instant proceeding, commenced some six and one-half years after the birth of the child, is timely.  Petitioner's attack on the statute's constitutionality succeeds because the mother and father of a child born out of wedlock have equal rights in relation to their child and a declaration of paternity encompasses much more than simply ordering support; therefore, there is no justification for providing different limitations periods for mothers as for fathers, who may wait until just prior to the child's 18th birthday to bring a proceeding, and the State's interest in avoiding stale or fraudulent claims can be equally served by a gender-neutral statute.  Inasmuch&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as scientific advances have ameliorated many of the problems of proof in paternity cases, where a disparity exists between differing limitations periods, the longer, not the shorter, period should apply.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New York Loft Law, N.Y. Mult. Dwell. Law &sect; 280 et seq., was enacted to meet the emergency situation created by the number of commercial and manufacturing buildings being converted into residential use without compliance with applicable building codes. The New York City Loft Board was created by this law and pursuant to its statutory authority, it enacted rules and regulations relating to the minimum housing maintenance standards for interim multiple dwellings. Petitioners alleged that the regulation relating to heating was constitutional infirm as it did not include pass along costs for the owners' increased fuel expenses. The court dismissed petitioners' claim and ruled that the regulations were constitutional. The court held that the Board had authority to pass the regulations and its failure to include a cost pass-along was neither arbitrary nor capricious. The court noted that the costs would eventually be passed along in rent adjustments after the properties were in compliance with the N.Y. Multiple Dwelling Law.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a proceeding challenging the constitutionality of a regulation issued by the New York City Loft Board, petitioners' threshold procedural attack that the Board failed to make a specific finding of a special emergency before issuing the regulation is meritless; as the Legislature itself described the emergency which prompted the enactment of the enabling legislation, it would be duplicative to require the Loft Board to make a new finding of an emergency each time it enacts a regulation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Loft Law withstands constitutional challenge since it was enacted in response to an emergency situation created by illegal loft conversions; the means selected by the Legislature to remedy those conversion problems were reasonable in light of policy considerations to prompt owners of buildings containing converted lofts to bring their buildings into compliance with applicable health and safety codes.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, an otherwise valid regulation is not invalidated merely because it imposes financial burdens on certain parties.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Loft Board of the City of New York (board) determined that petitioner building owner's premises were an interim multiple dwelling as defined by N.Y. Mult. Dwell. Law &sect; 7-C. The owner filed an action against the board to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 7-C. The court entertained the owner's motion to annul the board's determination and a motion by residential tenants who sought leave to intervene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenant applied to the board for classification under &sect; 7-C because the law protected the health, safety, and welfare or residential tenants by enforcing residential building code regulations on such property pursuant to N.Y. Mult. Dwell. Law &sect; 280. The court found that the law afforded the landlord procedural due process, which included notice and access to a full and fair hearing, the right to call and cross-examine witnesses, and the right to adduce and rebut evidence. In holding that the New York Loft Law was constitutional, the court found that the law did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because the legislature created a classification based on legitimate state concerns, not one that was arbitrary. The court held that loft owners were singled out because their buildings posed fire and safety code violations and the owners often colluded with tenants to bring about the conditions that the law sought to correct. Further, the court found that the Loft Law did not violate U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1, because it did not improperly impair contracts between landlords and tenants. Every contract was subject to the lawful exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the owner's motion to annul the board's determination that the premises were subject to safety regulations.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Loft Law -- Constitutionality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner's landlord's attack on the constitutionality of the Loft Law (Multiple Dwelling Law art 7-C), in which the assertion is made that the law will cause tenants to flee their residences if the Loft Board grants landlords' requested increases in rent, or that the Board will fail to properly increase rents, thereby resulting in a diminution of the value of their premises in either event, is without factual foundation, based on sheer speculation, and flies in the face of the fact that New York City is experiencing one of the lowest residential vacancy rates in its history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Loft Law -- Constitutionality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although the Loft Law (Multiple Dwelling Law art 7-C) may be burdensome to owners of buildings subject to its strictures, it is not constitutionally infirm on the grounds that it destroys the value of said buildings, since a landlord may still operate his building, pass along his costs and receive an economic return; although petitioner landlord contends that the law will make the New York City housing crisis more severe, it is sufficient to note that if it is the finding of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Legislature that the law will alleviate the crisis it is not for the court to find otherwise, since it is beyond cavil that the interests addressed by the statute, housing safety and health, are legitimate ones, and even a cursory examination of the specific provisions of the law show them to be reasonably related to the ends sought to be achieved.  Consequently the court may not challenge the Legislature's acumen or second-guess the efficacy of the remedy chosen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Loft Law -- Constitutionality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Loft Law (Multiple Dwelling Law art 7-C) does not unconstitutionally regulate commercial rents since the statute is silent as to what would happen should a tenant use a portion of his residence for other purposes; although there is no denying that the landlord may, in some situations, be forced to charge less than the commercial market rate for space which is being used commercially, this result occurs as the incidental by-product of processes which are completely independent, i.e., neither encouraged nor discouraged, by the law.  Moreover, the tenant who seeks to abuse the statute and uses an inconsequential portion of his unit for residential purposes&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  may not be covered by the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Loft Law -- Constitutionality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The fact that the Legislature may have slighted a landlord's interest with respect to a loft unit which is being used for both residential and commercial purposes in its enactment of the Loft Law (Multiple Dwelling Law art 7-C), does not render the law unconstitutional since the Legislature had the right to act as it did, and the court shall not substitute its own judgment or the desires of litigants as alternatives to solutions given the force of law by the Legislature.  Thus, that a landlord may be receiving less than the market rate for commercial properties in situations in which a portion of residential premises is being used commercially weighs only as to the equities of the statute, and not as to its constitutionality.  Moreover, the same argument applies to petitioner's complaint that the resale value of his investment has been diminished and that he will not be able to obtain his expected rate of return on his investment, since there is no constitutionally guaranteed rate of return on investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Loft Law -- Constitutionality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Loft Law&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (Multiple Dwelling Law art 7-C) does not violate US Constitution, article I, &sect; 10 (1) because the statute is reasonable and necessary to serve an important and legitimate purpose for the general welfare; thus, although the statute may be said to impair contracts between landlords and tenants, it does not do so improperly because every contract is made subject to the lawful exercise of the police power. Neither is the statute violative of the equal protection clause: owners of commercial buildings which now house residential tenants are singled out because their buildings present particular problems in terms of fire and safety code violations, and because they have brought about extensive litigation, and have often colluded with tenants to bring about the conditions sought to be remedied.  Therefore, it is entirely rational that landlords who benefited from an influx of residential tenants now be made to pay the costs stemming from the presence of those tenants so that they may continue their residence in safety.  Finally, the statute affords building owners procedural due process in providing them notice of and access to a full and fair hearing, the right to call and cross-examine&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  witnesses, and to adduce and rebut evidence.  </SPAN></P>

The citizen alleged that N.Y. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 1, the &quot;forever wild&quot; provision, prohibited the lease of the public facilities to ORDA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that (1) the citizen had standing pursuant to N.Y. State Fin.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, officers of the New York City Housing Authority Police Department (HAPD), and residents of New Jersey, filed a motion for summary judgment against defendant New York City in the officers' action challenging the denial of veteran's credit for purposes of promotion on the ground that the officers were not residents of New York at the time the promotional list was established.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officers contended that the city's denial of veteran credits contravened N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 85(1)(a), the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the federal and state constitutions, the Privileges And Immunities Clause, the fundamental right to travel, and a certain order of the court and arbitrarily and irrationally discriminated against them. The court held in favor of the city. A state could constitutionally require local residence as a condition of entry level public employment. A fortiori, if a state could require a policeman, fireman, or other public employee to be a resident as an absolute condition of employment, it could legitimately adopt the far less coercive policy of favoring a resident veteran over a nonresident one who was seeking a supervisory promotion from the ranks. Therefore, so much of N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 6 as required state residency of an applicant at the time an eligible civil service list was established as a condition for an award of a veteran's bonus points was valid and the denial of veterans' credit to the officers was valid and in compliance with law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother was allegedly unable to care for her children because of mental disability for which she had refused medication. The matter was adjourned in contemplation of dismissal upon certain specific conditions, including a requirement that the mother continue in therapy and cooperate with supervision by the Commissioner. A petition alleging violation of the ACD was filed. The second sentence of Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 1039(e), which provided for disposition of a petition upon a deeming of neglect, was struck down as constitutionally offensive. The mother argued that the requirement of a hearing prior to restoration existed independently of the second sentence of &sect; 1039(e). The court disagreed and denied the requested hearing. To require proof of two separate sets of allegations where one ordinarily sufficed simply because an act of prosecutorial grace was extended was manifest absurdity. In no event could the court construe decisional law to require that a hearing be held simply to confer upon a petitioning child protective agency the right to prosecute its original case on the merits, a right incidentally, which was a statutory mandate under Fam.

According to the court, the legislature reduced the maximum period of imprisonment from one year to six months for all but 27 specifically designated Penal Law class A misdemeanors. The court noted that a defendant who was accused of violating a &quot;non-designated&quot; class A misdemeanor was entitled to a jury trial only when he was believed to be a &quot;second crime offender&quot; and the District Attorney filed a second crime offender information before trial. The filing of that information, per the court, entitled a defendant to a trial by jury. The court held that &sect; 340.40(2) was constitutional. The court held that the legislature was presumed to have gauged the locality's social and ethical judgments on the seriousness of the offense and weighed public opinion and history.

Exec. Law, art. 19-H, in a habeas corpus proceeding that sought an order directing respondent operator of a state-approved runaway youth program to transfer the children to the parent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parent's children ran away from home and were placed in the operator's runaway program without the parent being advised of the children's whereabouts pursuant to the Act. The parent obtained a writ of habeas corpus from the court and the children were returned. The court granted the parent's request to determine the constitutionality of the Act because mootness would likely be recurring. The parent contended that the children were being illegally detained because the Act impermissibly authorized an agency of the state to deprive him of the custody of his children without due process of law. The court held that the Act was constitutional and that the state had a duty as well as a right to protect the children's best interests where a conflict existed between the children and the parent. The court ruled that the state did not remove or detain the children but merely provided temporary refuge for the children when they left the parent's home without his consent. The court held that the children were the ones who sought refuge in the runaway program and that they were free to leave upon request unless a court order had been entered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an issue of first impression, the court addressed whether a court conducting a Wade hearing could consider the constitutionality of a stop which preceded the challenged identification in the absence of a defense motion The case resulted after defendant, a female, was forcibly stopped and arrested after the police had been informed that two males had committed theft crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for various theft crimes and the court held a Wade hearing. The court held that defendant's failure to timely raise the constitutionality of the police stop did not waive the determination of the illegal stop issue and that, since the stop violated the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend IV, the subsequent identification and evidence secured by the stop were suppressed. The court found that the police made no inquiry of other persons, and neither of the co-defendants behaved in a suspicious manner nor attempted to flee when the police approached. The court held that the bare description of race, sex, blue jeans and sneakers did not justify the stop and frisk, especially where the defendant did not match the sex description of the burglars that the officer was seeking. The court found no waiver by defendant where it was only upon the officer's testimony at the Wade hearing that the officer's knowledge and understanding was revealed and indicated that the stop was objectionable. The court held that defendant did not deliberately bypass the objection and met the &quot;good cause and interests of justice&quot; test for nonwaiver of the motion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Upon an evaluation of a police officer's demeanor, his mode of testifying, the inconsistencies in his testimony and its inherent improbability, it must be concluded that his testimony concerning the circumstances surrounding his stop and forcible arrest of two men suspected of having just robbed a computer store was inherently incredible and patently tailored to nullify constitutional objections; the testimony of the officer, who remembered virtually nothing else of the incident (including even who his partner was), was important to explain his actions and connect the defendants to the crime, since a logical link was needed between reportedly westward fleeing robbers and the defendants, who were apprehended east of the crime scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Search and Seizure -- Forcible Stop</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The act by police officers of immediately placing defendants &quot;against the wall&quot; on a street is clearly a forcible interference with their liberty as well as a humiliation which undermined their human dignity; therefore, it constituted a forcible stop notwithstanding the fact that the police did not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  have their guns drawn.  A forcible stop requires that the police have reasonable cause to believe that the persons stopped have committed, are committing, or are about to commit a crime, which is greater than the predicate needed to stop and inquire, where the police need only a justified suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Search and Seizure -- Forcible Stop -- Reasonable Cause</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Police officers lacked &quot;reasonable cause&quot; to believe that defendant had participated in a computer store burglary, and, thus, were not justified in forcibly stopping him on the street, where defendant and another were apprehended in the opposite direction from where a witness said the perpetrators had fled, where the description which the police officers had was as sparse, nonspecific and subject to mistake and abuse as is imaginable, lacking height, weight, physical disability, unusual clothing, facial characteristics or anything else capable of distinguishing between the men stopped and any other two black men within 20 blocks, and where the persons stopped engaged in no behavior, such as attempted flight, which might elevate suspicion or increase predicate knowledge; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  indeed, one of the officers testified that defendant did not even appear to the officer to be male (he was a transvestite), and that he believed the computer one of the men was carrying was a television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Search and Seizure -- Waiver of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Police Conduct</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The failure of defendant to make the appropriate motions pursuant to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Dunaway</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Mapp</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to object to the unconstitutional procedures employed by the police in effecting his arrest does not constitute a waiver of his objections; although defense counsel knew that the People intended to introduce physical evidence seized from the defendant, had access to the radio run heard by the arresting officer, and also knew that defendant was a transvestite, it was not until the arresting officer testified at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Wade</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hearing that the officer's knowledge regarding the gender of the men he sought, which would be critical to a determination of the officer's predicate/response vis-a-vis stopping defendant on the street, was revealed, and thus, it was at least arguable that the officer's belief that he was arresting a female -- like grounds first obtained through </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Rosario</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> material -- could&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not have been discovered until the officer actually testified at the hearing.  Accordingly, enough has been shown to meet the &quot;good cause and interests of justice&quot; test to deny any waiver of defendant's objections, and since the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Dunaway</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> motion was made immediately after the officer's testimony and a hearing was already underway, no delay resulted from consideration and determination of the additional constitutional claims.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There remained but one further determination to be made in the certiorari actions at bar before a final money judgment could be entered. Previous determinations had been made with respect to the value of the individual properties for the years in question, and the court, by a previously entered order, fixed the applicable equalization rates to be applied to said values for those years agreement could not be reached. Petitioners then made application to the court for an award of expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, for proving an equalization rate less than that contained in their demand served pursuant to &sect; 716. Petitioner, having the right to time his or her demand, was required in fairness to be bound by the facts then existing. Therefore, while not expressly stated, implied within &sect; 716 was the proposition that the reasonableness of the denial was required to be determined as of the time the denial was made. The court concluded that sufficient reason existed at the time the demand was made upon respondent to refuse to admit to a rate equal to the equalization rate found by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city published a list showing accumulated sick leave and vacation time of its police officers. The list gave credit for disability time, but it was later revised to delete all vacation and sick pay accrued during disability periods. The officers filed a proceeding seeking to annul the city's determination. The court held that the matter could be reviewed in a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding because there was no mandatory grievance procedure. The court also held that the city was correct in determining that its original computation of accumulated sick leave and vacation time was illegal because the legislature indicated no intention to include fringe benefits as an additional payment with respect to N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A municipal police officer's entitlement to receive full salary during the period of disability leave (General Municipal Law &sect; 207-c) does not include the right to also accumulate sick leave and vacation time during the disability period since the statute established a policy to guarantee a &quot;full annual wage not to be interrupted in any respect by an employment connected disability&quot; and there is no indication of a legislative intent to include fringe benefits as an additional payment.  Since there is no mandatory grievance procedure in the parties' collective bargaining agreement concerning the issue of accrual of sick leave and vacation time during disability periods, the city's refusal to give credit for disability time may be reviewed in an article 78 proceeding.  In any event, any contractual provisions for sick pay allowances and vacation pay provisions during disability periods would be violative of the clear intent of section 207-c and would be unconstitutional gifts of public funds. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes and to dismiss the indictment against him on the grounds that the evidence before the Grand July was not legally sufficient to support the charges of sexual abuse in the first degree and endangering the welfare of a child and that the Grand Jury proceeding failed to conform to the requirements of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law art. 190.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that because the testimony of the victims was uncorroborated, it was insufficient to support the charges against him. He argued that a statutory amendment to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 130.16 that removed the requirement of corroboration when the victim's lack of consent arose solely by reason of age was an ex post facto law, a violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court concluded that the change was not an ex post facto law because it was procedural only and defendant was not denied a substantial personal right within the meaning of the ex post facto clause. Defendant contended that the amendment altered the legal rules of evidence to receive less or different testimony than what was required when the offense was committed. The court doubted the vitality of that contention, but reviewed the issue further. Removing the corroboration requirement did not change the quantum or degree of proof essential to conviction. The change did not deprive defendant of any former right or advantage that would have enabled him to show his innocence, it only altered the mode of proof. The jury still had to determine what weight and credibility to give the victim's testimony.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amendment of Penal Law &sect; 130.16 to remove the requirement of corroboration as to sex offenses when the victim's lack of consent arose solely by reason of age, did not constitute an ex post facto law since it did not punish as a crime an act which was innocent when done, enhance the punishment for a crime after its commission, or deprive defendant of any defense available to him according to the law at the time the act was committed; no element of the crime of sexual abuse in the first degree has been altered and each factual element of the offense must still be proven by competent and admissible evidence evincing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The statute in question is procedural and merely renders wholly competent to testify those who were previously considered only partially competent; as such, it has no &quot;conduct-influencing&quot; effect, does not deny defendant a substantial personal right, and does no violence to instinctive feelings of justice and fair play. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a corporation, filed a motion in a trial court (New York), seeking to dismiss an information that charged defendant with violating Yonkers, N.Y., Code &sect; 103-1 (1961), by permitting noxious weeds, long grass, or other rank growths, or growths that were harmful, poisonous, or detrimental to health, on real property owned by defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought to have the information dismissed on the grounds that Yonkers, N.Y., Code &sect;&sect; 103-1, 103-2 (1961) were unconstitutional and that the information was insufficient and defective on its face. A sanitation enforcement officer of the city's department of public works observed that a strip of land running the length of the defendant's property had become overgrown with high grasses and weeds. The officer returned to the office and researched the tax records of the city to determine the owner of the property. The officer then issued a &quot;warning notice&quot; to defendant, which allowed defendant five days to correct the violation. About eight days later, the officer determined that the grass and weeds had not been trimmed. He then issued the summons. Defendant argued that the ordinance failed to provide sufficient notice of the forbidden conduct in terms that were understandable to a person of ordinary intelligence. The court denied the motion to dismiss the indictment because the challenged ordinances were not unconstitutionally vague and in fact provided sufficient and proper notice of the type of conduct that was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A municipal ordinance which prohibits a landowner from permitting &quot;noxious weeds, long grass or other rank growths, or growths which are harmful, poisonous or detrimental to health,&quot; to grow on his property is not unconstitutionally vague and provides sufficient proper notice of the type of conduct which is prohibited; when the ordinance is read in its entirety, it is abundantly clear that an owner of property is put on notice that he shall be penalized when he either consciously or through neglect allows grass, weeds or other vegetation to grow too long or to flourish to a point where they become harmful or detrimental to health; moreover, the ordinance in question provides a reasonable method and procedure of due process.  While defendant questions the definition of &quot;long grass&quot;, grass and weeds 2 to 2 1/2 feet high, which were on defendant's property, would be considered long to any person of ordinary intelligence, and vegetation of that length could also be considered unsightly, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  provide an area for vermin to nest, thus possibly causing a health problem, and could attract litter, all problems of legitimate public concern.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff loft landlords and defendant city loft board (board) filed cross motions for summary judgment in the landlords' declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of the Loft Law, N.Y. Mult. Dwell. Law art. 7-C, and its accompanying regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The loft law legitimated the conversion of commercial leases to residential purposes and provided for tenant status and landlord rights to collect rents. The loft law also created the loft board to provide regulations for the conversions and appropriate costs and fees that could be passed on to the tenants. The loft board promulgated interim rent guidelines when leases expired, which provided calculations of rate increases. The landlords sought a declaration that the loft law was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to the landlords. The landlords and the loft board both sought summary judgment. The court granted summary judgment for the loft board on the constitutionality of the statute. The court determined that the loft law was a valid exercise of police power, which did not offend the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2(b)(2), or any other constitutional provision. The court, however, required the loft board to promulgate &quot;hardship&quot; regulations and schedule hearings for the landlords, holding that three years was not a reasonable period to have to wait for the institution of &quot;hardship&quot; regulations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Loft Law (Multiple Dwelling Law art 7-C) is a valid exercise of the State's police power and does not offend either US Constitution 14th Amendment or NY Constitution, article IX, &sect; 2 (b) (2); the legislative findings which motivated the enactment of the statute indicate its legitimate concern with health, safety and reasonable rentals for both landlords and tenants, and a court should not substitute its judgment as to solutions and remedies where the legislation is reasonably related to the problem at hand, the test being whether the means adopted by the Legislature to carry out its avowed purpose was reasonable under the circumstances, and not whether it was the wisest course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Loft Law -- Constitutionality -- Permissible Delegation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Loft Law (Multiple Dwelling Law art 7-C) is neither an unconstitutional &quot;taking&quot; of a landlord's property nor an impermissible delegation of authority to an administrative agency (the Loft Board), since it attempts to strike a balance between the financial interests of loft owners and tenants by regulating the rent levels prior&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the owner's compliance with occupancy standards, and providing for &quot;pass through&quot; from owner to tenant of the reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the owner in achieving compliance; the statutory language provides a sufficient standard so as to validate the delegation of legislative discretionary power to an administrative agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Loft Law -- Constitutionality -- Equal Protection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Loft Law (Multiple Dwelling Law art 7-C) does not deny landlords equal protection under the State and Federal Constitutions since its legislative classification is reasonably related to several legitimate public purposes, is neither &quot;wholly irrelevant&quot; nor &quot;patently arbitrary&quot;, and distinguishes commercial buildings with loft tenants from others because the loft occupancy has endangered public health and safety, and has created chaotic and unsettled legal problems.  Moreover, assuming the statute impairs contractual obligations with respect to existing leases, the law is a valid exercise of the police power under a declared housing emergency, and is constitutional since it serves an important purpose for the general welfare.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Where the Loft Board has failed to act on any hardship applications or to promulgate regulations such as defining &quot;necessary and reasonable&quot; costs of legalization and the &quot;buy out&quot; provisions as required under the Loft Law (Multiple Dwelling Law art 7-C), plaintiff landlords are entitled to an order directing the Board to promulgate schedules mandated by the statute and commence holding hardship hearings, since the Board's three-year delay in complying with the mandatory provisions of the law is inordinate, unreasonable, and without legal justification.  </SPAN></P>

The putative father stated that his duties, which required direct contact with a prison population, subjected him to a high risk of contracting acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a fatal disease for which there was no known cure. The putative father testified that certain inmates at the prison suffered from AIDS. A medical expert testified that the putative father would not have been at risk of contracting AIDS by submitting to a blood test. Because the expert evidence before the court clearly and convincingly indicated that the taking of a blood sample from the putative father would not have jeopardized his health, such testing was ordered by the court pursuant to N.Y.

The court granted the motion and held that in an effort to save the jostling statute from constitutional challenges, some courts have read the additional element of intent to steal into the statute. The court held, however, that such a reading was an improper exercise of judicial power.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jostling statute (Penal Law &sect; 165.25), which only requires that one intentionally and unnecessarily place his hand in the proximity of a person's handbag or pocket without explicitly requiring an intent to steal, is unconstitutionally vague and violative of the due process standards of notice and definiteness since a person of ordinary intelligence receives no guidance from the statute as to when the placement of his hand near another's handbag constitutes a crime; in addition, the statute's use of the word &quot;unnecessary&quot; encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement by delegating to the police officer in the street the absolute subjective power to decide which hand movements should result in arrests; reading the additional element of intent to steal into the jostling statute in order to save the statute from constitutional challenges is an improper exercise of judicial power since it is the role of the Legislature to draft the necessary and proper statutory tools to assist in combating crime.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties' separation agreement provided that support for the daughters was to terminate at age 18 and support for the son was to continue until age 21. The separation agreement was incorporated into the divorce judgment. The parties signed a modification agreement regarding the amount of support. By mutual agreement, the son went to live with the father, and the weekly support payments were reduced. When the oldest daughter turned 18, the father reduced his payments and sought modification. The family court denied the modification, found the father legally chargeable with the support of his 18-year-old daughter still in high school, and directed him to pay support for both daughters. The father contended that the court was not able to require him to support his 18-year-old daughter and brought another petition for modification. The family court denied the petition and held that the agreement of the parties contravened public policy, such that parents were chargeable with the support of the child until the age of 21, N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 413, unconstitutionally discriminated against the daughters, and did not realistically constitute an allocation of the support burden.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon respondent father's petition for downward modification of child support in accordance with the parties' separation agreement, which provided that support for respondent's daughters was to terminate at age 18, the Family Court has jurisdiction to order respondent to support his 18-year-old daughter absent a showing of an unforeseen and unreasonable change of circumstances and a concomitant increased need; the agreement of the parties clearly contravenes the public policy of the State that &quot;parents of a child under the age of twenty-one years are chargeable with the support of such child&quot; (Family Ct Act &sect; 413) and unconstitutionally discriminates against respondent's daughters by terminating their support at age 18, whereas support for respondent's son continued until age 21.  The agreement did not realistically constitute an allocation of the support burden between the parties, and the fact that respondent's 18-year-old daughter failed a grade and is presently a high school senior constitutes a substantial change in circumstances which continues respondent's statutory duty to support her.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After refusing to allow the commissioner to make twice-daily inspections of a landfill, the landfill owner filed an action in a federal district court challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 3-0301(2)(g). After the commissioner filed a motion to enjoin the landfill owner from interfering with the inspections, the federal district court dismissed the landfill owner's action under the abstention doctrine. The court denied the commissioner's motion for an injunction and held that (1) although the regulation of landfills was pervasive, the court was unable to determine, as a matter of law, that landfills were not entitled to some expectation of privacy; and (2) although frequent and unannounced inspections of landfills were warranted, &sect; 3-0301(2)(g), and N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 6, &sect; 360.1(j), authorizing routine warrantless inspections, were facially unconstitutional because they lacked proper limitations of time, place, and scope, and failed to minimally establish some guidelines as to regularity and frequency of inspection.

However, the court held that fundamental notions of procedural due process required that before the state could deprive a person of a significant property interest in aid of a creditor, that person must be given notice and an opportunity to be heard. The court held that state involvement, as opposed to direct state action, was all that was required under the state constitution. The court found that by allowing both repossession and collection of any deficiency, the state had changed the law of conditional sales and had transferred the traditional roles of judge, jury and sheriff without providing for any judicial supervision or other safeguards.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant motor vehicle owner appealed from an order of the Syracuse City Court (New York), which granted plaintiff injured motor cycle owner's motion to videotape the plaintiff's physician witness' testimony and denied defendant's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was driving a motorcycle and was involved in a collision with defendant. The trial court granted plaintiff's motion to videotape the physician witness' testimony and denied defendant's motion for summary judgment. Defendant appealed from both rulings. The court found that the ruling as to the videotaped testimony was not appealable under N.Y. Ct. App. Rules of Practice 1702 (a) (2). The court also affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for summary judgment. Contrary to defendant's argument, plaintiff was not required to demonstrate &quot;serious injury&quot; prior to bringing suit for noneconomic loss under the state's no-fault statute, N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 671(4). The insurance laws clearly exempted motorcycles from the definition of motor vehicle and also excluded motorcyclists from the receipt of first party benefits. Because plaintiff was not a &quot;covered person&quot; within the meaning of N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 671(10), the state's no-fault statute did not apply to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the trial court's ruling as to the videotaped testimony was not appealable. It also affirmed the trial court's order denying defendant's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A ruling of the Syracuse City Court, following a motion by defendant for a trial de novo after an arbitration panel awarded plaintiff an amount in excess of $ 5,000, which permitted plaintiff to videotape the testimony of a physician witness in order to lessen the expense associated with the witness' appearance in court is not, on defendant's appeal to County Court, appealable as of right since none of the provisions of UCCA 1702 are applicable; moreover, the City Court ruling is analogous to an evidentiary ruling made during the course of trial and, thus, is not now appealable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- No-Fault Automobile Insurance -- Action for Noneconomic Loss by Motorcyclist -- Serious Injury</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The owner/operator of a motorcycle can bring an action for noneconomic loss against the owner/operator of a motor vehicle without having to show serious injury pursuant to Insurance Law &sect; 671 (4); inasmuch as motorcycles are clearly exempted from the definition of motor vehicle, a motorcyclist is excluded from receipt of &quot;first party benefits&quot; (Insurance Law &sect; 671 [2]) and, therefore, a motorcyclist is not a covered person within the meaning of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the statute which precludes recovery for pain and suffering unless plaintiff can establish serious injury (Insurance Law &sect; 673 [1]).  Thus, an order which denied a motion by defendant motor vehicle operator for summary judgment dismissing plaintiff motorcyclist's action for noneconomic loss on the ground that plaintiff's proof failed to rise to the level of serious injury is affirmed.  </SPAN></P>

The court determined that the legislature's &quot;delegation&quot; of the power to determine who could examine defendants was reasonable and that the statute was sufficiently clear. The court found that defendant's history of mental illness did not diminish his competency to stand trial and that other facts supported the psychiatrists' determination that he was fit to proceed. Defendant cogently narrated the events surrounding his arrests, he rationally articulated defenses to the crimes charged, and he demonstrated familiarity with the criminal justice system and the roles of the judge and the lawyers. The court found that defendant was able to understand the proceedings against him and to assist in his defense and that he was fit to proceed.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the motion to dismiss because it determined that: (1) the charges were not based on those portions of the statutes that borrowed from the federal regulations and the only borrowed aspect, a testing procedure, had no effect on the crimes charged; (2) it was inappropriate to consider the reliability of the scientific evidence; (3) the placement of waste in steel drums in a receptacle for a sanitation company constituted a prima facie attempt to make a disposal.

The court held, however, that the decision to demolish without notice and absent an opportunity to be heard was not a decision that was discretionary.

The court declined to grant the motion and ruled that the issue of whether &sect; 1192(2) was void for vagueness was premature and speculative. The court determined that if, by the conclusion of the case, there was an insufficient showing that defendant knew or reasonably could have known that his blood count was in the forbidden level, counsel could raise the issue at that time. The court held that &sect; 1192(2) was not facially void for vagueness because the controlling threshold contained in the statute was both explicit and unambiguous. The court noted that the only voluntary act required to be proven for conviction under &sect; 1192(2) was the act of operating an automobile and that knowledge was not required.

However, since the statute amounts to no-fault criminal law because knowledge by the operator of the condition of his or her blood is not required, defendant may challenge the constitutionality of the statute as applied to him if the prosecutor makes an insufficient showing that defendant knew or reasonably could have known that his blood was in the forbidden condition.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a passenger in a taxicab. Police officers assigned to a special taxicab crime fighting unit positioned themselves visibly near and behind the cab defendant was riding in. When he turned around three or four times to look at them, they stopped the taxicab. Defendant was found to be in possession of weapons and drug contraband. He moved to suppress that evidence on the ground that there was no probable cause for the initial stop. The court granted the motion. It considered the stop as a police/citizen encounter, under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 140.5(1), rather than a vehicle stop. In the court's opinion, the rationale for the stop was illogical because at the exact same moment of recognition, the officers gained and lost their stated reason for stopping defendant. There was no assertion that defendant had committed a crime, or was committing a crime. The court held that the police had seized defendant when they blocked him in the rear of the cab and that the seizure was not based on reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Accordingly, the largely manufactured stop was constitutionally impermissible and the discovered evidence had to be suppressed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, owner and tenants organization, filed motions to have a consent decree stayed or clarified to allow the tenants to remain in their buildings. The owner had entered a consent decree with the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (DHPD) that required the owner to conform its buildings to the requirements of N.Y.C., N.Y., Housing Maintenance Code &sect; D26-33.07 (Code) as the result of an enforcement action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DHPD treated the buildings as rooming units in a converted dwelling, whereas the owner and tenant organization argued that the buildings were dwelling units occupied by families. The tenant organization filed a motion to compel the department of aging (DA) and a private legal services organization to find housing for evicted tenants. On appeal, the court denied the motion because the DA only provided housing information, and it required specific statutory authorization to compel it to find housing. The court decided to stay enforcement of the consent decree and to allow the tenants to remain in their residences within the limits of the language &sect; D26-33. In so holding, the court found that: (1) Section D26-33.07 was constitutional. (2) The city's definition of &quot;family&quot; in the Code was within its police power. (3) The ambiguity of the statutory language allowed the buildings to be viewed in two different ways. (4) Accepting the tenant's argument that the Code could be interpreted so that a &quot;family&quot; of one or more tenants occupying a room could rent adjoining rooms to boarders, where a family consisted of three unrelated persons, would lead to the least injustice.</SPAN></P>

The court found that only where the state law was intended to occupy the entire field, marked by a pervasive scheme of state regulation, that the local legislation had to yield. The state law only prohibited the use of certain amounts of chemicals. There was no comprehensive and detailed regulatory scheme adopted by the state with respect to sewer system cleaners. The court noted that the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, the agency responsible for interpreting the state law, deferred to the county's acceptance of the product analysis and the county's compliance requirements in the county ordinance. There was no evidence that the state intended to preempt the area at issue by way of Envtl. Conserv.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ECL article 39 does not preempt a local law which prohibits the sale of certain cesspool additives. There is no clear-cut showing that the Legislature intended to occupy the entire field of sewage system cleaners and additives; ECL 39-0105 prohibits only the use of certain amounts of restricted chemical material; nowhere does the legislation touch on any other areas of potential restriction as does the local law in question.  Moreover, since there is no explicit preemption contained in the statute, and since the administrative agency charged with enforcing the statute has adopted a not unrational interpretation that ECL article 39 does not preempt the enactment or continued viability of the local law, the court will not rule otherwise.  Neither ECL article 15 nor article 17, which vests the power to regulate and control water resources of the State exclusively with the State, contains a clear-cut intent to preempt the field of sewage system cleaners and additives. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. It was a proper exercise of the power of the Board of Estimate of the City of New York to adopt a resolution designed to prevent discrimination in hiring based on sexual orientation and affectional preference, i.e., homosexuality, and to include provisions in extension contracts offered to plaintiffs which required them not to so discriminate. The Board of Estimate, pursuant to its power to approve contracts (NY City Charter, &sect; 349, subd a), necessarily has the power to modify the terms of a contract or to insist that particular clauses be included in contracts; the subject resolution satisfies section 343 of the New York City Charter, which requires specific action on each contract approved by the Board, since it is specific and limited in application to one group of similar contracts.  It is within the Board's power to determine that limiting the award of service contracts to agencies who will refrain from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  discriminatory practices serves the City's best financial interests by insuring that contract costs are not artificially and unnecessarily inflated as a result of a construction of the labor pool that is produced by discrimination.  Moreover, there is support for the proposition that arbitrary treatment of persons based solely on their sexual preference may constitute an infringement of their rights under the United States Constitution and the New York State Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Rights -- Discrimination Based on Sexual Preference -- Homosexuality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The right of individuals to be free of arbitrary and disparate treatment in their employment solely on the basis of sexual preference is one of constitutional magnitude both under the Fourteenth Amendment and under section 11 of article I of the New York State Constitution; homosexuality is a protected category under both the State and Federal Constitutions.  Thus, the Board of Estimate of the City of New York did not engage in legislative action by adopting a resolution designed to prohibit discrimination in employment based on sexual orientation or affectional preference; the resolution merely stated the law as it presently&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is.

Defendant City of New York is not barred under the doctrines of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and collateral estoppel from litigating the issue of the validity of a resolution of the Board of Estimate concerning the prohibition of employment discrimination on the basis of &quot;sexual orientation&quot; or &quot;affectional preference&quot; adopted independently of any executive order and directed at specific contracts with plaintiffs, by a prior court decision holding that an executive order which also attempted to proscribe discrimination based on sexual preference was invalid and that a Board resolution, which ratified the invalid executive order, was equally invalid. Despite the broad language in the prior court's decision to the effect that the Board cannot legislate and cannot create social policy, it is clear that the earlier court did not and could not consider the powers of the Board of Estimate to adopt a resolution&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of specific import that is presently before the court; although both resolutions involve an attempt to proscribe discrimination based on sexual preference, the issues presented in the two cases differ substantially and compel the result that neither </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nor collateral estoppel are applicable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiffs, private agencies who perform a public function and receive substantial funding from the City of New York, are performing a State action and, therefore, directly subject to the constitutional mandates ordinarily applicable only to government entities.  Thus, plaintiffs, who provide social services to children pursuant to contracts with the City of New York, are subject to the constitutional requirement not to discriminate based on sexual orientation or affectional preference in the hiring of personnel in violation of equal protection provided by the Federal and State Constitutions; the hiring of employees by plaintiff agencies is integrally related to their public function and is not a collateral function which would possibly negate a finding of State&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- New York City Board of Estimate -- Power to Include Clause in City Contracts Forbidding Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Board of Estimate, as the agency of the City of New York charged with the duty to approve contracts, has an obligation under the State and Federal Constitutions to ensure that the City's funds are not used to support, encourage or in any other way implicate the City in the discriminatory conduct of others.  Accordingly, consistent with its constitutionally imposed duty not to support private discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or affectional preference, the City, by the Board of Estimate, had the right to include a clause forbidding such discrimination in hiring in the contracts of plaintiff agencies who receive substantial financial funding from the City and who have openly admitted that they intend to practice such discrimination.  </SPAN></P>

The mother made a motion for a pretrial suppression hearing in accordance with &sect;&sect; 710, 60.45, which were the governing provisions to test the issue of voluntariness in a criminal action and proceeding. The court denied the mother's motion because the confession obtained during a custodial interrogation could not be challenged as involuntary upon the same grounds in a civil proceeding as in a criminal prosecution. The court held that the traditional standard of proof in a civil proceeding was prescribed as the preponderance standard for adjudication of abuse or neglect in a child protective proceeding.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant realty corporation, charged with the violation of six sections of article III of the Nassau County Fire Prevention Ordinance (ordinance), which pertained to the storage of flammable chemicals, sought an order dismissing the information on the grounds, inter alia, that the statute defining the offense charged was unconstitutional and that the prosecution constituted selective enforcement in violation of the right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that because the ordinance incorporated by reference certain standards of a private association, it failed to notify an individual of the conduct proscribed, and constituted an improper delegation of legislative authority in violation of N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 16. The court denied that portion of defendant's motion seeking a dismissal of the information on the ground of discriminatory enforcement, holding that the ordinance was constitutional; it provided adequate notice of the conduct proscribed and did unconstitutionally delegate legislative power. The ordinance survived a vagueness challenge because defendant, as both owner and operator of the facility where the violations were alleged to exist, had adequate notice that it was required to comply with the ordinance. The ordinance did not violate equal protection in providing for a greater maximum fine for a corporation than for an individual. Defendant proved its claim of discriminatory enforcement; a selective enforcement strategy could be directed at serious violations that had progressed beyond tolerable limits. The factual part of count six of the information was held to be insufficient on its face.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article III of the Nassau County Fire Prevention Ordinance, by incorporating by reference certain standards of the National Fire Protection Association on file with the clerk of the County Board of Supervisors, does not constitute an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority (NY Const, art III, &sect; 16) since the standards are on file with the legislative body for all to peruse and the ordinance thus provides adequate notice of the conduct proscribed; the ordinance is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant for failing to specify whether the owner and/or operator of a facility is required to comply with its provisions since defendant is both the owner and operator of the facility in question and it thus had adequate notice of the conduct proscribed; the ordinance is not violative of defendant's right to equal protection for imposing a larger maximum fine for a corporation than for an individual violator since the distinction has a rational basis in view of the fact that a corporation cannot be imprisoned; the fact that the fire marshal did not enforce the fire code against the prior owners&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the facility is insufficient to meet the burden of proof required to sustain a claim of discriminatory enforcement which requires proof that the prosecution is motivated by a constitutionally impermissible reason.  </SPAN></P>

Part of the court's decision declared the statute of limitations in the N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect;517(a)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The father appealed both orders. Because of the significant questions in the appeal and the father's substantial contributions toward support of the child, the court granted the request to hold court costs in escrow. The mother's attorney was assigned from the indigent defendants legal panel pursuant to N.Y. County Law art. 18-B. Pursuant to N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 536 the court ruled that the father was liable for that portion of the mother's counsel fee which he was able to pay, even though the attorney was not privately retained. The mother's attorney requested the hourly rate he charged private clients, which was more than four times the rate paid to attorneys from the panel. The court concluded that his work justified the higher rate, but because he was assigned the attorney undertook to represent the mother at the rate paid to panel attorneys and must be held to that commitment.</SPAN></P>

The stipulation also provided that upon receipt of the funds, the recipient would neither contest the termination of her public assistance case nor reapply for public assistance benefits in the United States for a period of two years from the date of such termination. Noting that the recipient was a citizen of the United States, the court held that the agreement violated her constitutional right to travel. The state could neither require her to remain in the Dominican Republic nor prevent her from returning to New York, even if her return resulted in her readmission to the public assistance rolls.

The United States Congress then passed the Low Income Energy Act of 1981, authorizing HEAP grants to states to assist eligible households meet the cost of home energy. 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 8624(b) provided that the HEAP funds could be used to meet the cost of heating or cooling and not for any other purposes. The State adopted 1953 N.Y. Laws 53, substituting HEAP funds for the previously awarded &quot;home energy&quot; grants. The court awarded summary judgment to the association because HR households receiving HEAP funds both for heating and for utilities were receiving a greater share of HEAP funds than non-HR households, contrary to the heating cost-to-income ratio mandated by federal law.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a citizen-taxpayer action brought under article 7-A of the State Finance Law, plaintiff taxpayers are entitled to summary judgment and defendant State Comptroller is enjoined from providing home relief recipients with Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP) funds as authorized by chapter 53 of the Laws of 1983; under section 8624 (subd [b]) of title 42 of the United States Code, States which receive Federal HEAP grants must use the funds only to assist eligible households with respect to home heating and cooling whereas chapter 53 authorizes HEAP funds to be used as a substitute for that component (home energy grant) of home relief covering utility costs for lights, hot water and cooking; consequently this misapplication of HEAP funds serves to diminish the amount available to other qualified classes and is in violation of the allocation requirements of the Federal law (US Code, tit 42, &sect; 8624, subd [b]); furthermore, although the Federal scheme permits transfer of up to 10% of the grant, such funds may not be permissibly transferred to utility&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  expenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter concerned a certain deed of conveyance of real property executed to the corporation by the property owner on the day of final judgment in the foreclosure proceedings. The city filed a motion to vacate the stay of an administrative hearing concerning the real property transfer taxes arising from the deed. The court denied the city's motion and found that the city's delay of nearly two and one half years in making a determination on the transfer taxes was unreasonable. The city had all the information from the foreclosure proceedings, of which the city was a party but the corporation was not, to make it's determination. Furthermore, it should have been clear that the deed in question, made subject to the mortgage foreclosed upon, was not executed in lieu of foreclosure as the city alleged. Though the corporation had the burden of proving any prior liens, that burden was met because the city had actual or constructive knowledge of all the facts relevant to the corporation's position. The court also denied the motion by the lienor's committee to vacate the deed because the corporation, as grantee on the deed, was a necessary party.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mother instituted a proceeding to establish that respondent individual was the father of her child. The court issued a written opinion regarding its jurisdiction to consider the matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother filed a petition stating that she and the individual had planned to be married, that she became pregnant by him, and that he was killed in a car accident prior to the birth of the child. She sought an order of filiation to ensure that the child would receive any benefits due to him as a result of the individual's death. The trial court determined that it had jurisdiction over the matter, holding that the right to establish paternity existed after the death of the putative father. The court further determined that the requirement that the proceeding be adversarial could be properly met by the appointment of a representative to conduct the proceedings on behalf of the individual's estate. The court also found that it was necessary to appoint a guardian to represent the interests of the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered an order declaring that it had jurisdiction over the matter, named the individual's parents as his representatives, directed the mother to obtain a new summons and petition naming the parents as respondents, ordered the mother to effect personal service on the parents, and appointed a guardian for the child.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Since the Legislature has vested exclusive original jurisdiction over paternity proceedings in the Family Court and the function of a declaratory judgment is to determine justiciable controversies between parties which either are not ripe for adjudication by conventional forms of remedy or for other reasons are not amenable to the usual remedies, a paternity proceeding in the Family Court is the appropriate remedy for controversies concerning the determination of fatherhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Children Born out of Wedlock -- Paternity Proceeding -- Death of Putative Father before Commencement of Proceeding</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A Family Court has jurisdiction to entertain a paternity proceeding against a putative father who died prior to the commencement of the proceeding since the Legislature, by its amendment of section 518 of the Family Court Act, made it clear that the right to bring a paternity proceeding exists after the death, mental illness or absence of the mother and to construe the legislative intent as being to exclude the survival of paternity actions after the death of the father would be inappropriate as the Legislature, which has expanded&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the obligations and benefits received by an order of filiation to include, among others, the right to inherit, the right to recover benefits under the Workers' Compensation Law, the Veterans' Benefits Act and the Social Security Act, and the right to recover serviceman's life insurance proceeds, would be providing rights to out-of-wedlock children that survive the death of the father and which attach by establishing paternity without providing a forum to obtain a remedy; furthermore, the requirement that the paternity proceeding be adversarial can be met by permitting an authorized person, such as the next of kin to the child, to conduct the defense of the proceeding and by appointing a Law Guardian to represent the interests of the child.  </SPAN></P>

Respondent tenant argued that the 30-day notice to terminate the tenancy was served in violation of an existing stay of a pending protest and that judgment of possession should not be granted to the landlord.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenant filed a timely protest after the landlords obtained a certificate of eviction. During the pendency of the tenant's protest proceeding, the landlords served upon the tenant a 30-day notice to terminate the tenancy. Thereafter, a notice of petition and petition in holdover was personally served on the tenant. The landlords filed a motion for summary judgment for an order of final judgment of possession pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3212. The tenant argued that the 30-day notice to terminate the tenancy was served in violation of the existing stay of the pending protest, and that judgment of possession should not be granted to the landlord. The court held that during the pendency of the protest determination, a statutory stay of the order of the certificate of eviction was in force. Thus, the court ruled that the 30-day notice to terminate, invalid at inception, could not be revived by a subsequent, favorable change of facts, i.e, the termination of the stay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the holdover procedure for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the proceeding was jurisdictionally defective by virtue of the invalid notice to terminate.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to section 101 of the New York City Rent and Eviction Regulations a tenant's timely filing with the Rent Commission of a protest against his landlord's certificate of eviction stays the order granting the certificate until final determination of the protest by the Commissioner and this stay is effective notwithstanding landlord's lack of notice of the protest; furthermore, landlord's service of a 30-day notice to terminate the tenancy during the stay is without force or effect; in addition, since the notice to terminate is invalid, the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the instant holdover proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Summary Proceedings -- Restoration to Calendar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Summary Proceedings -- Tenant's Right to Possession</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.

The court denied the applicant's application. Where there was neither a suspect classification nor infringement of a fundamental right, a classification would be sustained so long as there was a rational relationship between the classes established and a legitimate governmental interest. The age limitation furthered a legitimate state interest in assuring the physical preparedness of the police and did not violate equal protection. Age was a bona fide occupational qualification because it was related to ability to perform the rigorous tasks related to police work.

The commissioner filed an objection to the report, claiming that he was entitled to rely on the prima facie presumption contained in N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 437. The commissioner argued that the &quot;prima facie&quot; presumption allowed him to forego proof of the parent's income. The court dismissed the petition. The court held the parent's unsworn statements concerning his gross income, without an examination into his needs, were insufficient to meet the commissioner's burden of proof. Section 437 was a presumption of fact, which a trier of fact was authorized, but not required to draw from the evidence. It was not a conclusive presumption of law or a rebuttable presumption of law whose effect was to place the burden on the parent to come forward with evidence to rebut the presumption. The commissioner failed to prove whether the parent had enough income to support his wife and children.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presumption of sufficient means to support contained in section 437 of the Family Court Act does not relieve a petitioner in a support proceeding from demonstrating a respondent's ability to furnish such support for a spouse and/or children regardless of whether the gravamen of the support request is a &quot;public charge&quot; needs basis or a &quot;means&quot; basis; the sufficient means presumption is a presumption of fact which is not conclusive and may be rejected by the trier of the fact; moreover, in providing the presumption, section 437 does not distinguish between the bases for support.  Accordingly, the hearing officer did not err as a matter of law in recommending dismissal of the petition in a support proceeding due to failure of proof as to respondent's income, where petitioner Commissioner of Social Services relied solely on the prima facie presumption of section 437 and presented no further proof of respondent's financial circumstances; petitioner's failure to demonstrate respondent's ability to pay support and mere reliance on the statutory presumption warrant dismissal of the petition.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant illegitimate children had been issued a citation to show cause why they should not be barred from any distributive share of the decedent's estate. After two of the children defaulted, plaintiff administratrix sought summary judgment dismissing the objections filed by the guardian ad litem on behalf of the minor child on the grounds that the child did not qualify as an out-of-wedlock child under N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 4-1.2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In raising objections to the administratrix's accounting of the decedent's estate, the guardian contended that a child's legitimacy was determined by the law of his place of birth or domicile, and that under the law of Connecticut where the child was domiciled at the time of his decedent's death, the child would be considered legitimate. The court found that at the time of the decedent's death, the relevant statute in Connecticut was partially or wholly void by reason of that state's supreme court precedent. However, it also was the court's determination that the common-law classification of a child born out of wedlock as being a &quot;filius nullius&quot; was unconstitutional. Because no valid distinction could therefore be made in Connecticut between the legitimate and illegitimate children of a man at the time of the decedent's death, the court also declined to make such a distinction. The court thus concluded that because neither the amendment to &sect; 4-1.2 nor Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45-274 was retroactive, the child was considered the legitimate child of the decedent. Accordingly, the administratrix was not entitled to summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the administratrix's motion for summary judgment and directed the parties to complete what pretrial discovery was necessary regarding the other objections raised by the guardian ad litem to the account of the administratrix.</SPAN></P>

The court previously denied the commissioner's application for failure to provide adequate notice to the judgment debtor. The court denied the commissioner's application. The court held that the affidavit and papers submitted by the commissioner did not excuse the commissioner's failure to submit proof of service of notice of exempt property on the judgment debtor and that the commissioner was not prevented from bringing facts to the court's attention because of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The court held that, even if notice of exempt property were given to the judgment debtor at the time of service of the original warrant, procedural due process required that additional notice be given for any motion or application for an extension of levy because the judgment debtor may have acquired property after the initial levy. The court reiterated that N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 573(2) was unconstitutional for failure to require service of notice of exempt property on a judgment debtor.</SPAN></P>

The salesman filed a motion to dissolve the injunction and argued that the provisions of &sect; 359-g(3) that prevented a court from modifying an injunction issued under &sect; 353 were an unconstitutional limitation on the court's equity jurisdiction and that the certificate of relief from civil disabilities granted to him in his criminal conviction rendered the injunction ineffectual.

The court still retained the right to modify the injunction if the reason for its existence, the criminal conviction, disappeared.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vendors were licensed to sell food on the streets of New York City. The vendors argued that a local law and its amendments were arbitrary and capricious in that they limited the vendors' access to various streets. The law prohibited food vending in designated areas during specified times. An amendment to the law imposed a 30-foot rule to further restrict access to streets. In ruling on the vendors' petition filed under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 alleging lack of proper notice of the hearing and an opportunity to comment on the proposed amendments, the court found that the city had concluded that the presence of food vendors could pose a health and safety hazard to an already congested street. Although reasonable people might disagree, there was ample support in the record for such a conclusion, and it was consistent with the municipality's mandate to promote and preserve the public welfare. However, as to the 30-foot rule, the city and others made no effort to justify the rule's application by the introduction of evidence concerning the traffic at the designated streets or in any other manner. Therefore, the decision adopting the 30-foot rule was not supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A local law of the City of New York and the implementing regulation of the Department of Consumer Affairs which prohibit food vending in designated areas during specified times based upon a finding that the presence of licensed food vendors on a street already congested by pedestrian or vehicular traffic &quot;would constitute a serious and immediate threat to the health, safety and well-being of the public&quot; (Local Laws, 1983, No. 17 of City of New York), are not arbitrary and capricious since the conclusion of the City Council that the presence of food vendors may pose a health and safety hazard to an already congested street is consistent with the city's mandate to promote and preserve the public welfare and there is thus no need for the Commissioner of Consumer Affairs to demonstrate that the presence of food vendors in designated areas adds to existing congestion but only that the combination represents a threat to public health and safety; since the restrictions on the placement of vendors' &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  vehicles, pushcarts and stands are merely part of the city's continuing management of vending activity, the city was not required to prepare an environmental impact statement before promulgating the subject regulation (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 6 NYCRR 617.13 [d] [15]); although the Commissioner's factual determinations with respect to the designated streets were properly based on substantial evidence, the rule proscribing vending within 30 feet of restricted streets is unsupported by substantial evidence and must be set aside.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor ordered state agencies, which have regular contact with the public, to conduct voter registration projects to assist citizens in registering to vote. The chairman argued that the program was unconstitutional and illegal and sought a preliminary injunction to enjoin implementation of the program. The court determined that the chairman was likely to prevail in the litigation. N.Y. Const. art. II. set forth the qualifications necessary to vote and invested the legislature with control of the means and methods of conducting voter registration and elections. The legislature had exclusive jurisdiction in the area of voter registration and was able to tailor its plans to meet local needs. In response to its duties, the legislature enacted a comprehensive plan to govern voting in the state. The governor failed to cite any law authorizing him to establish a voter registration program. The absence of such authority established a likelihood that the chairman would prevail in the action. The irreparable injury to the chairman and all citizens of the state was manifest if the program was implemented and it allowed the executive branch to exceed its authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landlord, owner of commercial premises used as a club for clientele interested in sadism and masochism, brought a summary proceeding under N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord of commercial premises used as a club for clientele interested in sadism and masochism brought a summary proceeding against the tenant, seeking a judgment of eviction because the lease prohibited the tenant from using the premises for any unlawful purpose. The landlord presented evidence that the tenant maintained a house of assignation for lewd persons in violation of N.Y. Real Prop. Acts Laws &sect; 711(5) and staged obscene performances that violated the criminal obscenity statutes. The landlord also argued that the tenant permitted or promoted prostitution on the premises. The tenant asserted a constitutionally protected right of privacy as a defense, claiming that the club was a private accommodation. The trial court found that there was no evidence of prostitution, but the club was not a private accommodation and was not entitled to the constitutional protection sought. The trial court found that the landlord was entitled to a judgment of eviction because the evidence established that the tenant maintained a place of assignation for lewd persons and violated the criminal obscenity statutes. The trial court held that there was an independent basis for eviction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner, the owner of commercial premises, is entitled to a judgment of eviction against respondent tenant, which operated a &quot;club&quot; on the premises at which sadomasochistic and sexual conduct occurred, based upon the use of the premises as a &quot;place of assignation for lewd persons&quot; and for illegal business ( RPAPL 711, subd 5).  Although prostitution, in its commonly understood meaning, has not been established to have occurred on the premises, in view of the facts that the activities taking place at the premises appeal predominantly to the prurient interest in sex (the conduct depicts sexual intercourse, sodomy, sadism and masochism in a lewd and patently offensive manner) and the club lacks any serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value, respondent has produced, presented or directed obscene performances within the meaning of section 235.05 of the Penal Law. Respondent is actually maintaining a commercial establishment open to the public and not a private membership club and there is thus no constitutional impediment based on respondent's right to privacy to granting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a judgment of eviction in favor of petitioner.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 168-a, which prohibited ticket scalping, after he offered to sell the complainant a single ticket to a singer's performance. He filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first argued that &sect; 168-a was unconstitutionally broad and vague because the statute's heading, &quot;Ticket speculators,&quot; had no interpretative value and thus left the statute's parameters inadequately defined. The court held that the heading was not only part of the statute, but clearly reflected the legislature's intent. Moreover, the meaning and purpose of the statute, to curb the practice of selling tickets at exorbitant prices, was clear from its legislative history. Next, the court rejected defendant's argument that law enforcement officials had enforced the statute in a discriminatory manner. Absent any consciously illegal discrimination, selectivity in enforcing penal statutes was not in itself unconstitutional. Here, the coliseum where defendant had attempted to sell the ticket was an area known for illegal ticket scalping, and the enforcement of the statute there was a proper and expected means of police deterrence. Finally, the complaint was not insufficient on its face because it alleged only one solicitation. The legislature did not intend to limit the meaning of &quot;the business of selling&quot; within the statute to habitual transactions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Section 168-a of the General Business Law, the purpose of which is to curb the practice of &quot;hawking&quot; tickets at exorbitant prices, is not unconstitutionally broad and vague; the restraint or prohibition of &quot;hawking&quot; has been historically regarded as a justifiable exercise of the police power, and defendant's allegation of selective enforcement of the statute at the location where he was arrested is not of an invidious discriminatory nature but is rather a proper and expected means of police deterrence. Further, an allegation of one solicitation constitutes the &quot;business of selling&quot; within the meaning of the statute; the purpose of the statute was clearly to include individual solicitations. </SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. 7804(f), 3211(a)(2), (7), asserting nonjusticiability, failure to exhaust contractual remedies, failure of the petition to state a cause of action, and a lack of standing on the part of the employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees' petition alleged that the projected closing of the facility would inflict additional overcrowding on the remaining prisons and the concomitant creation of an unreasonably dangerous working environment in violation of N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 27-a. The court denied the officials' motion to dismiss. The court found that N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 27-a(6) and (7) permitted an article 78 action by public employees to enjoin conditions of public employment reasonably expected to cause death or injury. The court found that the matter's complexity did not make it nonjusticiable, and the court was competent to determine whether the officials had satisfied their statutory duty, and if not, to direct them to do so. The court found that the employees had standing under N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 27-a(7)(c), and that the requirement to comply with labor laws was not an &quot;encroachment&quot; into the officials' executive decision-making. The court noted that the petition challenged the actions as unconstitutional and beyond their statutory authority, thus exhaustion of contractual remedies was unnecessary. Assuming the employees' allegations to be true, the court found the petition stated a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a proceeding brought on behalf of employees of the Department of Correctional Services to enjoin respondents from closing a State correctional facility, respondents' motion to dismiss is denied.  Petitioners have standing to seek relief under section 27-a of the Labor Law, which requires employers to furnish a place of employment which is free from recognized hazards causing or likely to cause death or serious physical harm and providing reasonable and adequate protection to employees' lives, safety or health, and to comply with safety and health standards, and permits an action to be brought seeking injunctive relief to eliminate any conditions or practices in a place of public employment which could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious injury; claims do not present a nonjusticiable controversy merely because the activity contemplated on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the State's part may be complex and rife with the exercise of discretion, and if a statutory directive is mandatory it is within the courts' competence to ascertain whether an agency has satisfied the duty imposed upon it; and petitioners need not exhaust their administrative remedies since they challenge respondents' action as being unconstitutional and beyond the Governor's grant of power. Petitioners state seven causes of action and the motion to dismiss upon the ground that the petition fails to state a cause of action, which is addressed to the petition as a whole, must be denied in its entirety since it cannot be said as a matter of law that petitioners fail to state a cause of action under section 27-a.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor committed several burglaries in one neighborhood, where he worked as a paperboy, using the knowledge he gained to know when certain people would be gone so that he could burglarize their houses. Two victim homeowners brought civil actions against the minor and the jury awarded compensatory and punitive damages. The minor moved to set aside the award of punitive damages. The court held that minors could be treated as adults in civil actions, and punitive damages assessed against them, if there was evidence that the minor acted with malice or with deliberate knowledge of the rights of the plaintiffs and with the intent to interfere with them, or if the minor was guilty of other morally culpable conduct. The court held that the evidence presented showed a well thought out and deliberate plan, and that the jury considered defendant's age and his cooperation with police.

After the sentencing, the State discovered that defendant had been previously convicted of a predicate felony in another state.

The State argued that because defendant had not been sentenced under the second felony offender sentencing provisions of N.Y.

However, the court granted defendant's motion to dismiss his filed sobriety test because defendant was not warned that that anything he did or said may have formulated the basis for his arrest. The court held that a police officer had to inform defendant that he could legitimately refuse to submit to the test, and that his refusal would not be admissible against him in a court of law. The court found that sufficient warnings were given to justify the denial of the suppression of defendant's breathalyzer test.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Police officers may properly stop one or more lanes of motor vehicle traffic temporarily at a driving while intoxicated (DWI) safety check roadblock conducted in a nonarbitrary, nondiscriminatory manner; the danger to be prevented and the lifesaving aspects to the drivers and other citizenry outweigh the inconvenience and render the intrusion reasonable in such a properly conducted DWI roadblock. Accordingly, the stop of defendant, who had been driving in a normal manner, at a roadblock set up for the purpose of apprehending intoxicated or impaired drivers in which all of the cars of one or two lanes of traffic were stopped and the drivers were briefly questioned was constitutional, and the motion by defendant to dismiss the information charging him with violating subdivisions 2 and 3 of section 1192 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law on the ground that the initial stop was in violation of his constitutional rights is denied.</SPAN></P>

Further, where consent is obtained, the People have a heavy burden to prove that it was a voluntary and knowing consent.  However, the results of dexterity tests performed at the precinct after a breathalyzer test was administered to defendant need not be suppressed, since any defect arising out of errors during the field sobriety test is attenuated, sufficient time having passed and sufficient warnings having been given to justify the belief that defendant had been returned to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the status of one who was acting voluntarily.</SPAN></P>

The failure of the police department to preserve breathalyzer ampoules for retesting by a defendant charged with driving while intoxicated or impaired goes to the weight of the test evidence offered rather than to its admissibility and provides no constitutional impediment to prosecution; the People are not required either to preserve the original ampoule or breath sample or to produce and preserve a second ampoule or breath sample for the defense.  Accordingly, defendant's motion to suppress the results of his breathalyzer test in a prosecution on charges of violating subdivisions 2 and 3 of section 1192 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law on the ground that the evidence was not preserved for independent testing is denied.  </SPAN></P>

Finding nothing unconstitutional in the felony murder statute, the court denied defendant's motion in all respects. The court held that the higher courts of the state clearly held that the elements of intent, or malice, or malice aforethought were not elements of the statute, thus it did not have the liberty to interpret the statute as requiring intent.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subdivision 3 of section 125.25 of the Penal Law, the felony murder statute, is constitutional; the affirmative defense contained in subdivision 3 does not violate a defendant's right to due process, and the lack of the element of intent to kill is not violative of a defendant's due process or equal protection rights, since nothing in the United States Constitution deprives Legislatures of the power to impose upon those who kill their victims in the course of inherently dangerous felonies the same sanctions they choose for those who kill their victims after meditation.  Further, notwithstanding that the law &quot;presumes&quot; intent from the commission of the underlying felony, the statute is constitutional; since intent is not an element of the crime in reality there is no presumption of intent, and the presumption is not a true one but rather a rule of law. There is no equal protection violation because the statute specifies only certain felonies as underlying felonies for felony murder; there is a rational basis for distinguishing between the enumerated and the nonenumerated felonies. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed an indictment in the court (New York) against defendant accusing him of criminal possession of stolen property in the first degree, forgery of a vehicle identification number, and violation of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 415-a. Defendant argued that he was subject to an unlawful search and seizure and filed a motion to suppress various automobile parts. The state asserted that the seizure was incidental to a lawful arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court conducted a pretrial suppression hearing and held that in accordance with &sect; 415-a the police, in order to make a routine administrative inspection, entered defendant's premises, which was engaged in business as a vehicle dismantler. The court found that the police entered without a warrant. The court held that when a person entered the business of vehicle dismantling, he entered a general area that had long been regulated. The court held that in conducting the specific business of dismantling motor vehicles, a person accepted the burdens, as well as the benefits of his trade, and consented to the restrictions placed upon him. The court held that the inspections authorized by &sect; 415-a posed only a limited threat to a vehicle dismantler's justifiable expectation of privacy. The court held that the police were making a routine administrative inspection which did not run afoul of constitutional prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures. The court held that defendant had no objection to the inspection, showed his licenses, and cooperated with the police in their inspection. Thus, the police had probable cause to arrest defendant upon finding stolen property.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The routine administrative inspection by the police of defendant's premises, which housed a vehicle dismantling business, does not run afoul of the constitutional prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures since defendant, by entering into the business of vehicle dismantling, has entered into a general area -- motor vehicles -- which has long been regulated, and he has thereby effectively consented to the restrictions placed upon him by subdivision 5 of section 415-a of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, which authorizes the type of administrative search conducted herein and mandates the keeping of certain records; in conducting the business of dismantling motor vehicles, a person accepts the burdens, as well as the benefits of his trade, and the afore-mentioned statutory inspections pose only a limited threat to his justifiable expectations of privacy.  Consequently, where the police seized items pursuant to a legitimate administrative search which was consented to by defendant, who was no neophyte, having been previously convicted of a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  felony, those items need not be suppressed because their seizure was unaccompanied by a warrant; rather, those items, which had been reported stolen, gave the police both probable cause to arrest defendant and the right to seize property contemporaneously with the arrest without a search warrant. </SPAN></P>

The court granted the city's motion for summary judgment, holding that the corporate borrowers had no vested right in the rate of taxation. The court further found that the retroactivity of the tax at issue was not harsh or oppressive. The 10-week period of retroactivity was relatively short, the legislation was introduced prior to the date of its effectiveness, and the public purpose advanced for the tax was creditable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The retroactive application of a statute which more than doubled the rate of the mortgage recording tax in New York City (see Tax Law, &sect; 253-a; Administrative Code of the City of New York, &sect; W46-1.0 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.) is not unconstitutional since there is generally no constitutional objection to retroactive application of a tax statute, and no taxpayer has a vested right in the rate of taxation; so long as the proposed retroactive application is not unreasonably long, serves a public purpose and does not unreasonably disappoint the taxpayer's justified reliance on prior law, such application will not violate due process.  The retroactive application of the instant tax is not harsh or oppressive since the 10-week period of retroactivity is relatively short, the legislation was introduced prior to the date of its eventual effectiveness, and the public purpose advanced, to aid mass transit and to recoup revenue lost by the repeal of the city's gains tax on real property transfers, is creditable. In addition, there is nothing in the statute which nullifies provisions in any contractual agreements since the tax was in effect at the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  time the parties dealt with each other; a mere increase in rate did not impair contractual rights.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officers brought their complaint and request for declaratory and injunctive relief after the police chief issued a directive prohibiting off-duty officers from working at any establishment licensed to sell alcohol for on-premises consumption. The court granted a preliminary injunction in favor of the police officers. The court held that nothing in &sect; 128 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law prohibited the employment of off-duty police officers merely as guards or security personnel at local establishments licensed to sell alcohol. The court found that N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 9, &sect; 100.1 went beyond the legislative mandate of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law and appeared to be arbitrary and in excess of statutory authority. Thus, the action taken by the city was based on an invalid agency regulation and had to be enjoined.

Therefore, a municipal police department's rule restricting the off-duty employment of its officers in the manner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  suggested by the regulation in question must be preliminarily enjoined since the likelihood of the officers' success on the merits is of high probability and the irreparable injury that may be done to the public by enforcement of the rule is clear inasmuch as the employment of the off-duty officers contributes to public safety. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the husband was injured in a work-related accident, he received a 40 percent cut in salary for a time and received no pay for several months. During that time, the husband failed to make the court ordered support payments. Social services filed suit and sought to impose arrears. The husband filed a cross-petition, seeking a retroactive suspension of the order period for the time period that he was injured and claiming that he had good cause for failing to make the payments. The court ruled in favor of the husband. The court held that the husband presented a complete defense on the merits and a justifiable excuse under the surrounding circumstances for failure to come to court at that time to seek suspension of the support order. The husband, the court determined, was never advised and did not know that it was necessary for him to come to court to seek suspension of the support order based upon his inability to pay support in order to be excused from liability for such payments. Further, stated the court, the husband justifiably relied on the fact that the support payments were made by payroll deduction.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, the Commissioner of Social Services may not impose arrears on a respondent who failed to pay support for a brief period some six years earlier due to loss of pay occasioned by an accident; despite the repeal of section 458 of the Family Court Act (&quot;Cancellation of arrears&quot;) the court has inherent residual power to effect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">de facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cancellation of arrears in appropriate circumstances under the good cause mandate set forth in sections 455 and 460, and its continuing jurisdiction over its own support orders under section 451 of the Family Court Act.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that spikes were not metal knuckles within the meaning of the statute. The court was unable to find a definition of metal knuckles in the statute. Similarly, the legislative history was silent on the matter. Metal knuckles had never been defined by the legislature. The court, therefore, looked to the common dictionary definitions of metal knuckles. These definitions referred to &quot;metal finger rings&quot; or a &quot;metal device.&quot; Accepting these definitions, the court concluded that leather straps with spikes protruding from them were not included in these definitions.

Inasmuch as the information charging defendants with criminal possession of a weapon is defective, the court need not address the constitutional issue of vagueness which courts of original jurisdiction should pass upon only as a matter of last resort. </SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion to dismiss and asserted that the &sect; 1192(2) was unconstitutional because it defined criminal behavior solely in terms of a mathematical measure of blood alcohol content and that it failed to provide adequate notice of its prohibition to prospective violators.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with drunk driving under &sect; 1192(2) and filed a motion to dismiss. The court denied defendant's motion and found that &sect; 1192(2) was not void for preciseness. The court held the statute's absolute liability provision patently warned the drinking driver that his indulging must have stopped before his blood alcohol level exceeded the legal limit. The court ruled that the fact that &sect; 1192(2) did not specify the precise number of drinks permissible or that a drinking driver might not have been able to discern whether his blood alcohol level was above the legal limit did not invalidate the provision on vagueness grounds. The court held that fair notice was provided by &sect; 1192(2) and that a person who drank any alcohol was accorded an unambiguous warning that in order to avoid potential criminal behavior, he should have refrained from driving within a relatively short span of time. The court found no reason why a person of ordinary intelligence would have had any difficulty in understanding that if he had drunk anything containing alcohol and particularly any substantial amount thereof, he should not have attempted to take control of a motor vehicle.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subdivision 2 of section 1192 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, which sets a per se liability standard of .10% or more of alcohol in a driver's blood, reflects a legislative determination that when a defendant drives with that amount of alcohol in his blood, the question of guilt need not be defined by his subjective behavior and condition, and is not unconstitutionally vague for lack of notice of what is prohibited.  Since the .10 absolute liability provision patently warns the drinking driver that his indulging must stop before his blood alcohol content (BAC) exceeds the legally acceptable limit, the fact that the statute does not specify the precise number of drinks permissible, or that a drinking driver might not be able to discern whether his BAC is .09, .10, or .11, does not invalidate the provision on vagueness grounds.  The .10 BAC limit is a standard that an ordinary person can understand, and one need not be a mathematician or quantitative analyst in order to conform his behavior to the statutory limit.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Verdict -- Impeachment of Verdict -- Exception</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In New York, it has long been the general rule that jurors may not impeach their verdicts by affidavit or testimony, thereby fostering the public policies of finality of verdicts, open discussion among jurors in their deliberation, and protection from posttrial harassment; the rule against impeachment of verdicts encompasses the ways the individual juror was influenced or the effect on mental processes, and therefore, public policy reasons for not invading the jury deliberations must ordinarily override possible injustice to a defendant.  However, an exception to the rule has been recognized in cases involving the introduction of extraneous material before the jury, and CPL 330.30 permits vacatur of a verdict where there has been improper conduct which may have affected a substantial right of the defendant; in each case the facts and circumstances must be examined to determine whether defendant was prejudiced, and defendant has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence every fact essential to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  support a motion to vacate ( CPL 330.40, subd 2, par [g]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Jury -- Disqualification of Juror -- Physical and Mental Incompetence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant's posttrial allegation that two jurors were physically and mentally incompetent to deliberate as jurors must be rejected where those allegations were not supported by the record, and any inquiry would be beyond the permissible scope of the exception to the rule of nonimpeachment of jury verdicts; that a juror has a change of heart, or asserts that he was coerced into the verdict, or that he even believes in the defendant's innocence, shall not affect a verdict and must be ignored, since the appropriate time for the jurors to have raised these issues was when the verdict was announced in open court and the jurors polled. Moreover, defendant's contention that three jurors did not answer questions on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> truthfully, thereby depriving him of his right to make challenges, also must be rejected since there is no evidence in the record to support such a charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Setting Verdict Aside -- Juror and Other Misconduct</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant has met his burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he has been&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  prejudiced where, at a posttrial hearing, there was evidence that several jurors engaged in premature discussions of the case; that discussions of the case among four jurors took place outside the presence of the full panel after it had been charged; that some jurors viewed a newspaper headline dealing with the general subject of the case, and that there was an ex parte communication between a court officer and at least three jurors regarding the length of their sequestration.  Although some of the irregularities by themselves would not warrant the relief sought, cumulatively, the damage to defendant's entitlement to a fair trial was overwhelming.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord filed a holdover action against the tenant alleging that the tenant was precluded from assigning an apartment pursuant to the Omnibus Housing Act, 1983 N.Y. Laws ch. 403, which contained an amendment to N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 226-b that effectively abrogated the right to assign a lease without the landlord's consent. The landlord filed a motion for summary judgment and the tenant filed a motion to dismiss. The court denied both motions, but granted tenant a reverse summary judgment dismissing the landlord's petition. The court found the legislative purpose of the amendment to &sect; 226-b was not to reach back to invalidate assignments completed prior to the effective date of the amendment, but rather to ensure reaching later assignments even though the lease being signed predated the amendment. The court held that if the new &sect; 226-b were to be applied to an assignment completed prior to the effective date, it would have unconstitutionally impaired contract rights. The court concluded that because the old section of &sect; 112-b governed, the tenant was entitled to proceed with the assignment of the lease because the landlord's refusal to approve the assignment was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a holdover summary proceeding commenced upon grounds that respondent tenant assigned her lease on June 20, 1983 despite petitioner landlord's rejection of the proposed assignment, and such assignment was valid as a matter of law under former section 226-b of the Real Property Law, respondent is entitled to summary judgment dismissing the petition.  The new section 226-b, which limits a tenant's remedy for a landlord's refusal to consent to an assignment to a release from the obligations of the lease no matter how unreasonable such refusal, does not reach back to invalidate assignments completed prior to June 30, 1983; the purpose of the new statute's retroactivity is to ensure reaching later assignments even though the lease being assigned predates the effective date of the new section 226-b.  Moreover, application of the new statute to a valid assignment completed prior to June 30, 1983 would unconstitutionally impair contract rights. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the homeowners failed to pay a portion of a county tax due on their home, a tax sale was conducted and the property was sold to the purchaser. The purchaser then brought a suit against the homeowners to determine the ownership of the home. The homeowners failed to answer, and a default judgment was entered against them. The court granted the homeowners' motion to vacate the default judgment, holding that they may have been able to prove that the deed issued to the purchaser was invalid. The court held that because the county failed to notify the homeowners of their arrears as required by Nassau County, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 5-14.0, and failed to serve a redemption notice on them or their adult son as required by Nassau County, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 5-51.0, the tax sale proceeding was deficient. The court held that thus, the resulting tax deed given to the purchaser may not have been valid so as to pass title of the home to her. The court held that the homeowners should have been afforded an opportunity to plead their right to redeem.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an action to compel the determination of a claim to real property, a motion by defendants to vacate a default judgment which decreed that plaintiff, who had purchased a tax lien on defendants' residence, located in Nassau County, was the owner in fee simple and barred the defendants from any right, title or interest in the premises is granted.  A prerequisite for a purchaser to obtain good title in a tax sale is strict compliance with statutory notice requirements, and the Nassau County Administrative Code permits a defendant to make satisfaction &quot;as if no deed had been issued&quot; and compels the plaintiff to afford a defendant that right.  Accordingly, defendants should be afforded an opportunity to plead their right to redeem; they lost their home because of an inadvertent failure to pay part of one year's tax, and were denied notice of that default required by the code to be shown on subsequent tax bills; moreover, the fact that their adult son, who resided in the subject premises while defendants wintered in Florida, was not served with a notice to redeem&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as required in the case of an occupant, may upon a trial be found to be an additional defect in the proceeding.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer produced children's headwear and was engaged in interstate commerce.

The DOL notified the manufacturer that it had violated N.Y. Lab. Law &sect;&sect; 26, 661 by failing to permit employee interviews concerning wages paid and hours worked and for failing to allow inspections of payroll records. The board ordered the manufacturer to comply with the DOL's demand for compliance. The manufacturer argued that the Act preempted the state's regulation of wages and hours and that the state had no right to inspect its records or to interview its employees. The court dismissed the manufacturer's petition to set aside the board's ruling. The court rejected the manufacturer's supremacy clause argument because there was no direct conflict between &sect; 11 of the Act and N.Y. Lab. Law &sect;&sect; 26, 661. The court held that the state's record-keeping and reporting requirements were not preempted by the federal requirements because the state's right to regulate gave it the implied power to do what was necessary to enforce the regulations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court was the motion to dismiss filed by defendant board of elections in the action of petitioner prospective candidate to force the board to validate his designating petition under N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 2-122, as amended by 1983 N.Y. Laws 1000. Although he wanted to run as a candidate for delegate to the Democratic National Convention from the 16th congressional district, his designating petition showed the 17th district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the instant election proceeding, the prospective candidate sought to validate his designating petition. He had hoped to run in a presidential primary election as a candidate for delegate from the 16th district to the Democratic National Convention. However, his statement of candidacy indicated that he was seeking election from the 17th district, his designating petition showed that he was from the 16th district, and the correction allegedly filed could not be found. The court dismissed the petition because the discrepancy in the district designation between the statement and the petition was a fatal defect, which in and of itself disqualified the prospective candidate. Judicial intervention would have prejudiced substantial rights of others and might have unconstitutionally upset the delicate balance of interests protected by the statutes and party rules. The prospective candidate could not be certified in either district because he had not filed the proper documentation in either. Further, the validation proceeding was not timely commenced under N.Y.

Pursuant to Democratic Party rules promulgated in accordance with the current presidential primary law (L 1983, ch 1000), the filing of a valid statement of candidacy listing the correct Congressional district is a condition precedent to a permissible candidacy, and judicial intervention would prejudice substantial rights of others and might unconstitutionally upset the delicate balance of interests protected by the interrelated statute and party rules.  Accordingly, the discrepancy in district designation between the statement and petition is a fatal defect, and petitioner cannot be certified as a candidate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in either district, since in neither district did he file both a proper statement of candidacy and a valid designating petition. Moreover, even if the discrepancy in district designation were not a fatal defect, the proceeding would be dismissed as not having been timely commenced; petitioner's four-day hesitation between receiving notice of the Board of Elections' adverse determination and obtaining an order to show cause evinces the absence of the diligence and alacrity which the law requires.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Commissioner of Social Services of the City of New York filed a paternity proceeding against respondent father. The father admitted paternity and consented to an order directing support. The commissioner submitted orders of filiation and an order of support which contained a provision authorizing income deduction. The father alleged that the income deduction provision's notice requirement violated due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that an income deduction order was a prepared form declaring that its effectiveness upon (a) a finding by the commissioner's support collection unit that the father defaulted, and (b) service on the employer of a copy of the income deduction order. The court found that the proposed support order declared that there was to be no deduction until the support collection unit found an arrearage, the father was notified at least 15 days prior to service of the income deduction order, and he failed to pay the arrearages within this period. The court found that when the support collection unit was the payee of a support order, the unit itself was charged with finding good cause mandating an income deduction order. The court held that there was no provision for judicial review, and that the only due process right was the opportunity to pay within the 15-day notice period. The court held that blind application of the order resulted in a person being deprived of his compensation from employment. The court held the finding by the support collection unit was to be subject to judicial review on notice to the father with an opportunity to contest that finding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that to satisfy due process considerations, support orders were to contain a clause providing that respondents were to be advised within 15 days of their right to contest a determination by the support collection unit's determination, and if a respondent successfully contested such a determination, the income deduction order would not then be served.</SPAN></P>

The sheriff filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3211(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff seized the judgment debtor's vehicle pursuant to an execution filed by the judgment creditor. The sheriff's office contacted the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles requesting that it notify the vehicle's owner of the seizure. It also published a notice of the sale. The vehicle was sold at auction. In the judgment debtor's action for the alleged unlawful seizure, he filed a motion for summary judgment and the sheriff filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The court granted summary judgment in favor of the sheriff and denied the judgment debtor's motion, holding that the sheriff satisfied his duty to notify the judgment debtor of the seizure and sale as required by N.Y. C.P.L.R. 5232 since the sheriff was under no obligation to serve the judgment debtor with notice in Connecticut. With respect to the argument that N.Y. C.P.L.R. 5232 was unconstitutional, the court noted that the legislature had corrected the constitutional deficiencies of the statute, but it was not done until after the auction. Therefore, the court ruled that in the absence of constitutional guidelines, the sheriff's execution and judicial sale were proper.</SPAN></P>

Further, the named defendant, the Sheriff of the City of New York, is not liable for the acts or omissions of his deputies (see Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; 1032-12.0, subd b), and the City of New York would be singularly liable for any wrongful acts of defendant's deputies. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a criminal trial, defense counsel challenged for cause a juror from the pool that was deaf. The defendant argued that he would be denied a fair trial under the Sixth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. VI, if the juror were allowed to sit because he could not be sure that the translation by the interpreter was accurate; that the deaf person would lose words if more than one person spoke at a time; that the deaf person could not hear subtle nuances of vocal inflections which are crucial in determining the credibility of any witness; that the sanctity of the jury deliberations would be violated by the presence of the interpreter; and that the presence of the interpreter would be too disruptive to both the trial and the deliberative process. The court found that a deaf juror is a member of a protected class and could not be excluded from the jury pool under state and federal law. To challenge him for cause would circumvent the intent of the legislature. Because the juror understood signed English, he met the statutory language requirement for jury service.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to the city's solicitation of bids for a public contract, petitioner was informed that its low bid was rejected because of a failure to complete an employment report. The purpose of the report was to show the number of minorities and women in its work force. Petitioner argued that it was committed to a policy of nondiscrimination and that it would be a waste of funds not to give the contract to the lowest bidder. The city argued that could decline bids which did not comply with bid specifications.The court found that petitioner's bid was rejected because it failed to complete the information necessary for it to be awarded a bid. Petitioner's deliberate refusal to submit a completed employment report, although on notice that same was necessary to the submission of its bid, was a material variance of the bid specifications. Therefore, the city's rejection of petitioner's bid was proper.

Petitioner's deliberate refusal to submit the completed report, although on notice that same was necessary to the submission of its bid, was a material variance of the bid specifications; the requirement to fill out such report is not mandating a quota nor is it imposing on potential contractors the requirement to institute an affirmative action program.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent corporate controller brought a motion to dismiss petitioner New York Attorney General's proceeding against him and to quash a subpoena duces tecum served upon him in reference to his corporation's having fraudulently sold gold future contracts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A corporate controller's corporation was selling fraudulent gold future contracts. The New York Attorney General began his investigation of the matter and the controller quickly moved to Florida. Through the U.S. Post Office, the Attorney General effectuated service of a subpoena duces tecum upon the controller. The controller requested that the court quash the subpoena because service of a subpoena by regular mail violated his procedural due process rights per the U.S. Constitution. The court denied the motion to quash and motion to dismiss the Attorney General's proceeding against the controller. The court ordered the controller to appear before the Attorney General within three days of its order. The court held that there was no proceeding because it was an investigation and the subpoena's service was adequate under the circumstances. The court reasoned that a subpoena could be served in the same fashion as a summons, N.Y. C.P.L.R. 2303, and where the court was satisfied that traditional modes were or would be unavailing, it could fashion another, N.Y. C.P.L.R. 308(5).

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The target of an investigation by the Attorney-General into the fraudulent sale of gold future contracts may not avoid the investigation by removing himself from the State; his motion to dismiss is denied, since there is no proceeding to dismiss, and his motion to quash, as unconstitutional, a subpoena served on him by mail in Florida is denied since the Constitution, under the due process clause, does not prescribe a mode of service, but only requires that the method selected be reasonably calculated to give full and timely notice of the proceeding and an opportunity to be heard, and the instant motion demonstrated that the service by mail met constitutional standards.  As to the contention that the subpoena is invalid because it was made under section 352-b of the General Business Law, which is designed to reach nonresidents doing or soliciting business in the State, it should be noted that a subpoena may be served in the same fashion as a summons and where the court is satisfied that traditional modes are or will be unavailing, it may fashion another, it being unnecessary that usual methods be attempted first since the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  statute was designed for the impracticable case.  </SPAN></P>

Act &sect; 517(b) was constitutionally defective because it unreasonably discriminated against nonmarital children seeking support from their fathers. The court found that N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 348 gave the commissioner a separate and independent right to sue as the mother's assignee. As her assignee he succeeded to her rights under N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 517(a) and the statute of limitations, if any, set forth in &sect; 517(a) governed. Therefore, when the commissioner sued as the mother's assignee he was also not subject to any statute of limitations. The constitutionality of N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 517(b) was upheld.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subdivision (b) of section 517 of the Family Court Act, which provides that the Commissioner of Social Services shall have 10 years after the birth of a child within which to commence a paternity proceeding, is not unconstitutional, since it is within the purview of the Legislature to set reasonable limitations on actions and 10 years is not per se unreasonable; accordingly, when the commissioner sues on his own behalf, he is subject to the 10-year Statute of Limitations.  However, section 348 of the Social Services Law gives the commissioner a separate and independent right to sue as the mother's assignee and as her assignee, he succeeds to her rights under subdivision (a) of section 517 of the Family Court Act, which gives a mother five years after the birth of the child to bring a paternity proceeding; inasmuch as subdivision (a) has been declared unconstitutional, the commissioner is not subject to any Statute of Limitations when he sues as the mother's assignee. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion in the Supreme Court of New York, Bronx County (New York) to withdraw a previously entered plea of guilty to criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and for dismissal of the indictment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found that defendant was charged in a prior indictment with robbery in the second degree, grand larceny in the third degree, criminal possession of stolen property in the third degree, and criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree, a misdemeanor arising from the same transaction as that in the case at bar. The court found that the indictment to which defendant pled guilty was a superseding indictment. The court further found that the trial court before which the prior indictment was heard dismissed all counts due to the People's failure to obtain witnesses. The court held that defendant's guilty plea to a charge that arose from the same transaction as the dismissed indictment must be withdrawn on the basis that double jeopardy barred defendant's prosecution for this offense. The court held that N.Y. C.P.L. R. 40.20 prevented a second prosecution arising from the same transaction as did the United States Constitution. The court vacated defendant's plea and discharged defendant.</SPAN></P>

A motion to withdraw a plea of guilty to an indictment charging defendant with criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and for dismissal of the indictment is granted, where a previous indictment arising from the same transaction charging defendant with criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree and three other offenses resulted in dismissal of the weapons charge and a trial order of dismissal as to the remaining counts because the prosecution was unable to obtain its witnesses, and the superseding indictment elevating the degree of the purely possessory weapons charge was based solely and exclusively on the defendant's prior commission of a crime. The trial order of dismissal had the same effect as an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes, and CPL 40.20 guards against double prosecutions where the offense may be differentiated only esoterically in law; the only factual change is the prior conviction, which is such an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  esoteric difference.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed defendant rubbing his covered erect penis against the buttocks of three females, in a public place.

Plaintiff State of New York dropped the charges of sexual abuse in violation of N.Y. Penal Code &sect; 130.55, but filed a motion to reargue. Defendant sought to have the information against him declared defective and &sect; 245.00 declared unconstitutional and to have plaintiff's motion denied. The trial court denied defendant's motions and granted plaintiff's motion to reargue. The court determined that defendant's conduct fell within the purview of the statute and that although he had no standing to challenge &sect; 245.00, that provision and &sect; 130.55 withstood constitutional challenges because they defined prohibited conduct in sufficient detail to give ordinarily intelligent people reasonable notice and to preclude arbitrary enforcement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant's actions of rubbing his covered erect penis against the buttocks of three women at a subway station and repeatedly stroking his covered erect penis with his hand in public is encompassed by the public lewdness statute (Penal Law, &sect; 245.00) since the statute, which, in addition to proscribing the intentional exposure of the private or intimate parts of the body in a lewd manner in a public place, also proscribes the commission of &quot;any other lewd act * * * in a public place&quot;, is clearly not limited to acts of &quot;exposure&quot; alone; there is no requirement that defendant have acted &quot;with intent that he be so observed&quot; since any intentional lewd act committed in public can be proscribed regardless of whether the defendant intended that he be observed; even though defendant has no standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute on grounds of vagueness since his conduct falls within the prohibition of the statute, the statute is not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad in any event since the phrase &quot;any other lewd act&quot; gives a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of the type&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of conduct that is proscribed but the Legislature should consider drafting a more specific statute to assist in ensuring uniform law enforcement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, city investigatory agency and city officials, issued administrative subpoenas duces tecum to petitioner non-profit organizations for certain original records of the organizations and of petitioner executive director. The non-profit organizations and the executive director brought a motion to quash the subpoenas. The city investigatory agency and city officials brought a cross-motion to enforce the subpoenas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The non-profit organizations and their executive director argued that the subpoenas were overbroad and lacked the requisite probable cause, and disputed the city investigatory agency's power and authority to conduct a personal criminal investigation of the executive director. The court agreed with the non-profit organizations and the executive director. Initially, the court found that administrative subpoenas were subject to the requirements of relevance and materiality, but in a purely investigatory administrative situation there was no necessity for any showing of probable cause such as the Fourth Amendment required for a criminal or civil warrant. The court held that an agency that asserted its subpoena power had to show the relevancy of the items sought and some basis for inquisitorial actions. The city investigatory agency's subpoenas failed to demonstrate the required degree of materiality and relevancy. Further, there was evidence that the materials sought were not for an administrative investigation, but in preparation or in aid of a criminal prosecution, which was not within the purview of the city investigatory agency's jurisdictional power.</SPAN></P>

The federal list of hazardous wastes incorporated by reference into N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 27-0903 had not been filed with the Department of State.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, charged with criminal possession of stolen property in the third degree (N.Y. Penal Law &sect;165.40), fraudulent accosting (N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 165.30), and loitering (N.Y. Penal Law &sect;240.35), sought to dismiss the charges of loitering on the grounds that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.35(7) violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that &sect; 240.35 was unconstitutional because it violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as the Fourth and Fifth Amendment. The statute provided that a person was guilty of violating &sect; 240.35 if he loitered or remained in any transportation facility, or was found sleeping therein, and was unable to give a satisfactory explanation of his presence. The court ruled that in order for defendants to overcome the presumptive constitutionality of the statute, they had the burden of showing that the statute was invalid beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that defendants failed to discharge their burden. The court concluded that there was a reasonable relationship between the welfare of the public at large and &sect; 240.35. The court observed that &sect; 240.35 was enacted to insure the safety of the patrons utilizing transportation facilities, which often served as the setting of the most violent crimes. The court held, therefore, that defendants failed to prove the statute's unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. The court denied defendants' motions to dismiss the loitering charges.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subdivision 7 of section 240.35 of the Penal Law which prohibits loitering in transportation facilities is constitutional.  Statutes which prohibit loitering at a specific location are sustainable if the prohibited behavior is properly restricted to specific facilities where the likelihood of illegal activity is notorious; there is a reasonable relationship between the welfare of the public at large and the concern and efforts of the Legislature to insure the safety of the many patrons who utilize transportation facilities which too often serve as the setting of society's most violent crimes.  Accordingly, motions by two defendants to dismiss charges of loitering on the ground that subdivision 7 of section 240.35 is unconstitutional are denied.  </SPAN></P>

In their petition, the cooperatives argued the failure to include statutory provisions for the commission to rule upon applications to make alterations to a non-landmark building in a historic district made the issuance of the notice to proceed an ultra vires act.

The omission of specific words authorizing alterations to nonlandmark buildings from section 207-8.0 (subd a, par [1]) of the Administrative Code was a simple oversight, and it was the legislative intent to give the Commission power to afford lesser relief to the owner of a nonlandmark building in such a district than the permission to demolish. Moreover, inasmuch as the Commission determined that respondent's charitable purpose of providing a well-rounded quality education was being undermined by the lack of a gymnasium and that the education of the students was being hindered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by such lack, its decision to issue the notice to proceed with alterations to respondent had a rational basis and was neither arbitrary, capricious nor contrary to law; such determination meets the standard applicable to nonprofit institutions which is analogous to the insufficient return standard applicable to profit-making entities.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed Local Law 23, and the businesses brought the action to declare it unconstitutional. The parties both filed motions for summary judgment. The court granted summary judgment to the city. The court found that the state had not declared an intent to occupy the entire area of drug paraphernalia regulation and therefore had not pre-empted local legislation, even when provisions from several titles were considered jointly. The court found the state's approach was fragmented and piecemeal. The criminal penalties of Local Law 23 were not inconsistent with the civil penalties of state law because inconsistency required more than mere difference. The court found the businesses only had standing to attack the multi-use items of Local Law 23, because they did not sell single-use items. The court found that Local Law 23 had a sufficient core meaning that defined under its terms what constituted drug paraphernalia to withstand the facial challenge and deter arbitrary enforcement. The businesses' remaining challenges were without merit.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 131-a was unconstitutional to the extent that it denied public assistance to individuals solely on the basis of their gross income exceeding 150 percent of the established standard of need. The court concluded that it was irrational and ironic that if the recipient had not gone to work she would have received a full monthly welfare grant but because she had gone to work she could not even receive the necessary money to bring her available income up to the level of a welfare grant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff senior citizens sought a declaration that a portion of a zoning ordinance, Town of North Hempstead, N.Y., Code of Ordinance art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance provided for a Golden Age Residence District permitting only multiple residence dwellings and accessory buildings designed for use by &quot;senior citizens.&quot; Section 70-89 provided that &quot;senior citizens&quot; meant people of 62 years of age or more, and that senior citizens applying for residence in a Golden Age Residence District should have legally resided in the town for at least one year prior to the date of their application. The senior citizens challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 70-89 on equal protection grounds. The court held that the residency requirement of &sect; 70-89 was unconstitutional. The durational residency requirement was a &quot;suspect&quot; classification because it infringed upon the fundamental right of travel, and as such was subject to the strict scrutiny test under equal protection analysis. The burden was therefore upon the town to prove that the classification was justified by a compelling state interest. The durational residency requirement did not further the legitimate governmental objective of providing for the housing needs of the elderly.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a proposed Christian Science care facility (facility), challenged a finding by respondent, the Zoning Board of Appeals of the Town of Henrietta, Monroe County (board) (New York), that the use proposed by the facility was not a permitted use under Henrietta, N.Y., Zoning Ordinance art. V, &sect; 127-6A(6), and challenged the board's denial of the facility's application for a use variance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The facility sought to operate a care facility within an area that was zoned for, among other things, churches and public hospitals, pursuant to local zoning ordinance &sect; 127-6A(6). The board determined that the proposed use was not permitted and also denied the facility's application for a use variance. On appeal the court ruled that the board's determinations were not arbitrary or capricious or otherwise erroneous. The court ruled that the facility, which would have provided a place rest, relaxation, and contemplation and study of Christian Science tenets, all for the purpose of healing the physical maladies of fee-paying tenants, was not a church or a public hospital within the meaning of the zoning law. Moreover, the court ruled, the fact that religious tenets would be used for the purpose of healing did not render the facility a religious entity entitled to First Amendment protections for religious institutions. The use variance was properly denied, the court ruled, because the town officials' promise that a permit would issue did not constitute a right to such a permit and there was no evidence that the property would not yield a reasonable return if used for a permitted use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the board's determinations.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A proposed facility which is residential in nature, providing room and board to fee-paying individuals, does not contain a common area or sanctuary set aside for worship, is staffed by accredited Christian Science nurses and practitioners, and which is intended as a place for rest, relaxation and contemplation where the residents, all Christian Scientists, would study the tenets of their religion for the purpose of healing does not qualify as a church or a public hospital or conventional health care facility, so as to constitute a permitted use under a town zoning ordinance; the facility's purpose is not public worship, an activity typically associated with a church, and it does not take on a religious use simply because its residents pray and contemplate as part of the process of healing; moreover, the facility would not perform conventional medical treatment or surgery and, thus, is not a public hospital with all the manifold purposes and services such an institution provides.  Accordingly, the finding of the town zoning board of appeals that petitioner's proposed use was not permitted under the zoning ordinance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was not improper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Religious Use Immunity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner's proposed Christian Science accredited care facility intended for the curing of physical ailments through religious worship, study, contemplation and prayer does not qualify as a religious use so as to invoke First Amendment protection and immunity from a town zoning ordinance which prohibits the use intended by petitioner; the fact that religious study and prayer may be employed to achieve the purpose of healing does not thereby convert that intended result into a religious one, even though the means used conform to the beliefs and discipline of the church. Moreover, petitioner's CPLR article 78 proceeding is defective since the essence of petitioner's attack is the constitutionality of the ordinance itself rather than its application, and the court cannot convert the proceeding to the proper action for declaratory judgment due to petitioner's failure to make the town a party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Variance for Unnecessary Hardship</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Petitioner's application for a variance to permit the use of land for a Christian Science accredited care facility asserting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that strict application of a town zoning ordinance which prohibits such use would result in hardship because the land was acquired for the purpose of constructing such a facility and that in reliance upon the representation of town officials that the facility would be permitted, petitioner invested substantial sums to acquire the property and obtain architectural and site plans, was properly denied.  A landowner is not entitled to a nonconforming use simply because issuing authorities promised to issue a permit for such use; moreover, there has been no showing that the land cannot yield a reasonable return if used for any purpose permitted in the zone; it is not uniqueness of the plight of the owner, but uniqueness of the land causing the plight, which is the criterion for granting a variance due to unnecessary hardship. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agency sought to permanently terminate the parental rights of the natural parents of two children. The action was commenced in Queens County. A new administrative directive of the Family Court required that trials of all contested termination of parental rights cases be referred to a new city-wide trial part in New York County. The agency sought to keep the trial in Queens County. The court denied the agency's challenge and determined that venue in New York County was proper. The agency's contention that Queens County was the only county where the matter could have originated was without merit. Pursuant to N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 384-b(3)(c), the matter could have properly been originated in the Family Court of New York County by the Commissioner of Social Services (Commissioner) because the Commissioner was the true legal custodian of the children and the Commissioner's office was in New York County. The agency's reliance on &sect; 174 of the Family Court Act to keep the case in Queens County was misplaced.

The tenant kept a small dog open and notoriously for six years with the landlord's knowledge. New York City, N.Y., Admin.

But the law only applied to &quot;existing and future leases and renewals.&quot; The court dismissed the petition and held that because &quot;existing&quot; leases meant leases entered into prior to the regulation's passage, the law applied retroactively. Application of the law to current leases did not unconstitutionally impair the obligation of contracts and deprive the landlord of property without due process of law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A local law was enacted which prohibited a landlord from attempting to evict a tenant for violating a no pet clause in the lease when the landlord had knowledge that the tenant harbored a pet for three months but took no action to enforce the no pet clause. Relying on the law, the tenants claimed that the landlord waived its right to commence the proceedings against them because they had their dogs more than three months and the landlord took no prior action. The court rejected the landlord's argument that the local law was unconstitutional because its retroactive application violated the sanctions and restrictions of the Urstadt Law, 1971 N.Y. Laws 372, as well as due process and the impairment of obligation of contracts. First, it was clear that the local law was intended to apply retroactively. Second, the retroactive application of the local law did not violate the Urstadt Law either in spirit or in letter. Indeed, the only enactments invalidated by the Urstadt restrictions involved those restricting rents. Third, the constitutional provision against the impairment of contracts was not absolute, if the disputed legislation was for the general good of the public.</SPAN></P>

After being assessed a $ 15,000 fine by the county, the builder sought a declaratory judgment that the county law was unconstitutional. The court held that the county ordinance was void and unenforceable because the state law specifically and entirely addressed the matter of a builder selling or conveying plots or units before or without filing the plat. Furthermore, the county fine of $ 500 exceeded its authority when the state only imposed a $ 100 fine. The county had no authority to issue a fine except by a civil action, which was not a requirement of the ordinance. However, the ordinance was not beyond a reasonable doubt unconstitutionally vague as applied to the builder.

The State contended that pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 400.21(8), defendant was estopped by judgment from challenging the prior conviction. However, because both prior convictions were listed in enhancing his previous sentence and only one was required, it was unclear whether a challenge to the current predicate was also waived. On that matter, the court ruled that because the earlier court was free to rely on both convictions and neither was challenged, that was sufficient to conclude that both prior convictions were relied upon. The court concluded that if the issue of estoppel was one of fact, then the State met their burden of showing waiver.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A defendant whose 1970 conviction for manslaughter in the first degree was unconstitutionally obtained in that he was not advised before pleading guilty of his right to remain silent and to confront and cross-examine witnesses (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Boykin v Alabama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 395 U.S. 238) was not ineffectively represented by counsel in 1975, when, after pleading guilty to robbery in the third degree, he was sentenced as a second felony offender based upon the 1970 conviction; under the law as it stood in 1975, the failure of the court which accepted the 1970 plea to inform defendant of his &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Boykin</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights&quot; did not vitiate the plea as a predicate for second felony offender status because it was sufficient for the court to determine that the plea was voluntarily and knowingly taken without specific mention of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Boykin</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Persistent Felony Offender</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A 1975 adjudication of defendant as a second felony offender is held to be based upon both the 1970 and 1972 predicate felonies cited by the People where sentencing minutes are unavailable and it is not possible to reconstruct the sentencing proceeding; section&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  70.06 of the Penal Law, as it read in 1975, defined second felony offender as a person convicted of a felony after having previously been subjected to one or more predicate felony convictions, and since defendant did not challenge, in 1975, the People's predicate felony statement citing both prior convictions, it must be presumed that the sentencing Judge relied upon both prior convictions in adjudicating defendant a second felony offender. Either of the two prior convictions was sufficient to sustain the second felony offender adjudication, and the People have thus met their burden of proving that the defendant is estopped (see CPL 400.21, subd 8) to challenge the constitutionality of the 1970 conviction and he may be sentenced following a 1983 plea of guilty to criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, as a persistent violent felony offender. The fact that there may have been good cause for failure to challenge the constitutionality of the 1970 conviction in the 1975 proceeding does not permit the defendant to challenge the constitutionality of the same conviction as a predicate for persistent violent felony adjudication; the provision of CPL 400.21 (subd 7, par [b]) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that failure to challenge the previous conviction constitutes a waiver of any allegation of unconstitutionality unless good cause is shown for such failure is independent of CPL 400.21 (subd 8), which provides that a finding that a defendant is a second felony offender shall be binding upon the defendant in any future proceeding in which the issue arises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Persistent Felony Offender</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A defendant may be sentenced as a persistent violent felony offender for an offense committed after adoption of the violent felony offender statutes, where his predicate violent felony convictions were not defined as such by the law applicable when he committed or was sentenced for them; there is no objection to reliance on those convictions based on the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution, nor does section 70.04 of the Penal Law preclude their use as predicate violent felony convictions.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subject property was operated as a seasonal mobile home park and was improved by 75 trailer sites with underground water, sewer and electrical connections. The taxpayer contended that the report of the referee had to be rejected for two reasons. He argued that because the assessors' appraiser failed to testify to the market value of the first year and the fourth year, his appraisal had to be accepted for those tow years. Next he argued that the referee incorrectly utilized N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 102(12)(g) and, in so doing, contravened N.Y. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 2. Upon review, the court held that the assessors' failure to present appraisals for the two years was not sufficient to justify accepting the taxpayer's appraisal. In addition, the taxpayer failed to make out a prima facie case by showing that &sect; 102(12)(g) was unconstitutional as applied in his case. Finally, the report had to be modified for the last two years because it was inconsistent with the proof since there was testimony that there were fewer trailers on the premises for such years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he was legally with the victim and there was no formal separation agreement. The only restraint was a protective order by the court, which defendant claimed did not give him notice that the sexual intercourse that he had with the victim at knifepoint was an offense. He contended that for not requiring the notice, the statute under which he was charged violated the due process and equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court determined that defendant was not entitled to the spousal exemption to rape because he failed to provide any justification for excluding an estranged wife from gender-based statute that rendered her the protection.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the extent that subdivision 4 of section 130.00 of the Penal Law grants a husband immunity from prosecution for the rape of his lawful wife, it is violative of the equal protection clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions; a wife has a right to the protection the law provides for nonspouses, and has been denied equal protection of law by the existence of immunity; no governmental interest can be served by its continued existence and it bears no reasonable relation to the class it should protect; accordingly, defendant husband who, in violation of an order of protection which mandated that defendant remain away from his estranged wife's premises and person and refrain from any acts or threats of physical violence, engaged in sexual intercourse with his wife without her consent, may be prosecuted for rape; said order was sufficient to apprise defendant that he could be charged with rape if he thereafter engaged in unconsented to sexual intercourse with his wife; moreover, a husband possesses no right to engage in such unconsented to sexual intercourse with his wife regardless of the existence of an order of protection.  </SPAN></P>

In determining that dismissal was proper the court considered, in part, (1) the seriousness and circumstances of the offense; (2) the extent of harm caused by the offense; (3) the evidence of guilty; (4) the history, character, and condition of defendant; and (5) the impact of a dismissal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Kidnapping -- Restraining Victim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Evidence presented to a Grand Jury was legally sufficient, if accepted as true, to establish every element of kidnapping in the first degree (Penal Law, &sect; 135.25, subd 2, pars [a], [b]) where the victim was allegedly tricked into getting into defendant's car, and transported and confined under threats for a one-week period by defendants who physically violated and sexually abused her and intended to commit a felony, i.e., promoting prostitution in the third degree, since her initial confinement was accomplished by means of a cleverly concocted deception which overcame her ability to consent, and her freedom to move was intentionally restricted by threats and violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Kidnapping -- Jurisdiction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Geographical jurisdiction of a county to prosecute for criminal activity is a question of fact which need not be established beyond a reasonable doubt, and CPL 20.40 (subd&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1, par [a]) confers jurisdiction upon a county when conduct occurred within such county sufficient to establish an element of the crime charged; accordingly, where the evidence adduced before the Grand Jury permits a fair and reasonable inference that a kidnapping victim was restrained and abducted in Suffolk County and then transported by defendant's vehicle to Queens County and held for one week, jurisdiction properly lies in Suffolk County, and therefore, the private vehicle trip statute ( CPL 20.40, subd 4, par [g]), which confers jurisdiction where strict adherence to the common law would create insurmountable problems to prosecuting crimes whose sites could not be clearly identified, is inapplicable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Corroboration of Accomplice Testimony -- Kidnapping</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The testimony of an alleged kidnap victim need not be corroborated as a matter of law since she was not an &quot;accomplice&quot; within the meaning of section 230.35 of the Penal Law, despite defendants' arguments that their intentions to use her as a prostitute made her an accomplice, where there was not one scintilla of evidence which would warrant the assumption that she was a prostitute or that defendants&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were her pimps; a victim of a kidnapping was never intended by the Legislature, implicitly or otherwise, to be deemed an accomplice within the meaning of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Kidnapping -- Period of Restraint</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The more severe penalties for kidnapping in the first degree where the victim was abducted and held for more than 12 hours is not violative of due process since there is a rational basis for increasing the penalty when the statute requires not only that the victim be held for more than 12 hours, but that the prolonged abduction was for a specific and intentional criminal purpose.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bus dispatcher sought a default judgment following service of the complaint. The city and one correction officer made an appearance, but one correction officer failed to appear. The bus dispatcher then sought a default judgment against the party that failed to appear. The bus dispatcher claimed that the time for that party to answer had expired, so a default judgment was warranted under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3215(a). The court denied the motion. No notice of the default motion was served on the correction officer who failed to appear or on the city. The court held that a motion for a default judgment must be given to a codefendant who has appeared and could be adversely affected by the judgment, even if no default judgment was being sought against that codefendant. The city was entitled to the constitutional protection of the Due Process Clause. Without all revenant facts before it, the court could not state with certainty that the city would not ultimately be required to indemnify the correction officer who failed to appear.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a tort action, a motion by plaintiff for a default judgment against one codefendant on the grounds that his time to appear has expired and he has not answered or moved with respect to the complaint need not be prefaced by notice to said codefendant; notice need not be given to a party in default for less than one year, who has not appeared, even if he is the party against whom entry of the default judgment is sought; said codefendant was apparently validly served with process and chose to default and, thus, neither CPLR 3215 nor due process standards require any further warning to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judgments -- Default Judgment -- Notice to Codefendant Who Has Appeared</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a tort action against two individual codefendants and the City of New York in its capacity as the employer of said codefendants and as a tort-feasor itself, the city is entitled to notice of a motion for default judgment against one of the individual codefendants; CPLR 3215 (subd [f], par 1) requires that notice of a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  motion for default judgment be given to all defendants who have appeared, whether or not subsequent action or inaction has placed them in default, and whether or not a default judgment is being sought against them; moreover, the possibility exists that the city, as the codefendant's employer, may be held liable to indemnify him, and a judgment against him could have consequences which would effectively deprive it of a full and fair opportunity to defend on the merits; accordingly, fundamental fairness and due process require that the city be served with notice of the motion; where a municipality is a party to litigation not involving the State, due process operates to guarantee the municipality the same protection as any other similarly situated litigant.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with fraudulent accosting in that with intent to defraud, by means of trick or swindle, he offered to sell to passersby &quot;14 karat&quot; gold chains, when in fact, the chains were not 14 karat gold. Defendant sought to dismiss the charges, claiming that what he was doing did not constitute a confidence game, and that the statute was void for vagueness. The court denied the motion, finding that while the mere representation by defendant that the chains were gold did not make the scheme a confidence game, defendant's actions fell within the purview of the statute because it specifically prohibited people from accosting others in public places with intent to defraud by trick, swindle, or confidence game. The court also found that although the words trick and swindle had broad meanings, they were sufficiently definite and gave fair notice of what was prohibited under the statute. The court reasoned that a statute would not be struck down as vague when the language had a generally understood meaning, and found that an ordinary person could understand the words trick and swindle within the context of the statute and that defendant's alleged conduct violated the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature amended Real Property Tax Law &sect; 744(1). The amendment retroactively precluded a special franchise holder from resorting to the Real Property Tax Law &sect; 720(3), and restricted proof to the equalization rate used by the SBEA in determining the assessment at issue. The court denied the cross motion and granted the motion. Due process did not require the right to demonstrate the inequality of the assessment because the equalization rate was considered a legislative act, and therefore, no hearing, was constitutionally required. The evidence was insufficient to demonstrate that the energy utility was denied equal protection of the law. The energy utility failed to show that application of the amended statute would deprive it of a vested right, or would be so harsh and oppressive as to violate due process. The parties agreed that if the constitutionality of the amendment were upheld, then the SBEA's motion for partial summary judgment would be granted.</SPAN></P>

The retroactive application of a 1982 statutory amendment restricting proof of inequality of a special franchise assessment to the State equalization rate used by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment in determining the final assessment under review (Real Property Tax Law, &sect; 744, subd 1) is not violative of due process since the application of the amended statute does not deprive a special franchise holder, such as petitioner public utility, of a vested right inasmuch as reliance on prior judicial declarations giving&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  special franchise holders the same rights as conventional real property owners to contest their assessments on inequality grounds does not constitute a vested property right such as would preclude a change or repeal by the Legislature; retrospective application of the statute is not violative of equal protection by differentiating between conventional real property owners and special franchise holders since the differences between the two classes warrant the treatment of special franchises as a separate class.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two police officers observed defendant grabbing and tackling a female's buttocks, causing her to jump away and to express alarm.

The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the information. The court found that N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 130.00 and 130.55 were not unconstitutionally vague. A reasonable man would have known that the female breasts and buttocks were not touched or fondled without the female's consent; it was clear that the buttocks were an intimate part within the meaning of the sexual assault statute.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 130.55 of the Penal Law, which defines sexual abuse in the third degree as subjecting another person to sexual contact without the latter's consent, thereby incorporating the definition of sexual contact found in subdivision 3 of section 130.00 of the Penal Law, in particular, the words &quot;any touching of the sexual or other intimate parts&quot;, is not unconstitutionally vague when applied to a defendant who allegedly grabbed an unidentified woman's buttocks without her consent in public.  Though no explicit standard as to what constitutes a &quot;sexual or intimate&quot; part is contained anywhere in article 130 of the Penal Law, the test as to whether these ordinary terms are sufficient and clear is whether a reasonable man subject to the statute would be informed of the nature of the offense prohibited and that which is required of him.  A reasonable man in this society would consider defendant's act to be proscribed behavior under this sexual abuse statute.  In addition, courts in this jurisdiction have consistently&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  held the buttocks to be an intimate part within the meaning of subdivision 3 of section 130.00 of the Penal Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sexual Abuse -- Sufficiency of Accusatory Instrument</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In order for an information to be facially sufficient pursuant to CPL 100.40, it must state the offense with which the defendant is charged and the particular facts establishing each and every element of that offense.  The essential elements of sexual abuse in the third degree are sexual contact and lack of consent; where it is alleged by a police officer rather than the victim that defendant grabbed and tackled the victim's buttocks in public, these allegations are sufficient to establish the element of sexual contact, and intent may be inferred from the factual portion of the information.  Nonconsent need not be sworn to by the victim since section 130.05 (subd 2, par [c]) of the Penal Law provides that lack of consent may result from &quot;any circumstances, in addition to forcible compulsion or incapacity to consent, in which the victim does not expressly or impliedly acquiesce in the actor's conduct.&quot; Though the absence of the victim at trial may be a factor for the trier of fact to consider&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in determining whether the People have met their burden of proof, the victim's testimony is not essential for the limited purpose of establishing facial sufficiency of the information.  The policeman's observations, though hearsay, are admissible under the exceptions of nonassertive conduct, evidence of the victim's state of mind or as a spontaneous declaration.  </SPAN></P>

The court denied respondent's motion to dismiss an action filed by petitioner to adjudicate the paternity of a 16-year-old boy. In the absence of evidence that respondent had made any regular, consistent, or substantial contributions toward the basic items of support for the child, the court could not conclude that the payment of allowance constituted a clear and unequivocal acknowledgment of paternity. Thus, petitioner had not carried the evidentiary burden to establish an exception to the statute of limitations set forth in &sect; 517(a) of the Family Court Act.

Furthermore, although the Statute of Limitations is tolled during the minority of the mother, it is not tolled during the child's minority, as are most actions, and the many safeguards in the New York statutory scheme for the rights of respondents in paternity proceedings mitigate possible injustice to a respondent caused by a delay in the institution of a proceeding.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an affidavit in support of his position, respondent stated that submitting to the blood test was against his religious conviction because it was an integral part of his religion to follow his conscience as his convictions lead. But respondent did not suggest any scriptural or doctrinal basis for his refusal. The court held that because defendant's refusal was based on his conscience and personal convictions, the order did not violate his right to the free exercise of his religion. The court held that the two part test in determining whether a person's right to the free exercise of his religion was infringed, depended upon a finding that the belief was sincere, and it was rooted in theological conviction. In applying the above test to the instant case, the court held that assuming respondent had met the first prong, the second prong was not met because his choice was philosophical and personal, rather than religious.

The court dismissed the landlord's eviction action without prejudice pursuant to 22 N.Y.

The court advised the landlord that he could bring a common-law action for ejectment in a different court. The court also concluded that it could not transfer the action to another court because N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 19(f) only authorized transfer when the court lacked jurisdiction and the landlord's inability to comply with the pleading requirements regarding membership in the Rent Stabilization Association was not a jurisdictional defect.

Officers searched a console between the seats and found the weapon on which the indictment was based. The People relied on N.Y.

The grand jury was given instructions, which consisted of a recitation of the &sect; 265.15(3) and N.Y. Penal Law 265.02(4) relating to criminal possession. The grand jury was not given instructions that the presumption was not a conclusive presumption. The court held that the failure to so instruct the grand jury was reversible error. Without this explanation the instruction concerning the presumption was misleading.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner New York Commissioner of Social Services commenced a support proceeding against respondent father, which was referred to a hearing examiner for the court. The hearing examiner recommended that the father pay $ 50 weekly for the support of the wife and his child effective as the date of the hearing and the first return date of process. The Commissioner filed a motion to disaffirm the report.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hearing examiner denied the Commissioner's motion to make the order retroactive to the date the petition was filed as required by N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 449. The Commissioner contended that the hearing examiner improperly concluded that &sect; 449 was unconstitutional and that the more appropriate amount of weekly support was $ 70, not $ 50. The court held that the amount of support ordered was proper, and that the Commissioner failed to preserve the issue. Section 449, which mandated that a support order be made retroactive to the date of the filing of the petition, was constitutional, being based upon recognition of the fact that support was a continuing obligation. However, the court counseled that &sect; 449 should not be utilized as a &quot;strait jacket&quot; to impose undue, unjust, and unfair hardship on the father but must be read in conjunction with N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 458, which granted the court discretion to excuse support arrears for &quot;good cause&quot; shown. The court observed that consideration of the father's ability to pay and &quot;good cause&quot; for nonpayment prior to the imposition of retroactive payments avoided an unconstitutional application of N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 449.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court confirmed the hearing examiner's report insofar as the amount of weekly support was concerned and set the matter down for a hearing on the issues pertaining to retroactive support.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While section 449 of the Family Court Act, which mandates that a support order be made retroactive to the date of the filing of the petition, is constitutional, being based upon recognition of the fact that support is a continuing obligation, the statute should not be utilized as a &quot;strait jacket&quot; to impose undue, unjust and unfair hardship on a litigant but must be read in conjunction with section 458 of the Family Court Act, which grants the court discretion to excuse support arrears for &quot;good cause&quot; shown, so as to require consideration of ability to pay and &quot;good cause&quot; for nonpayment before imposition of any retroactive payment in order to avoid a violation of due process; the key to proper application of section 449 is the necessity for considering whether the respondent exhibited culpable conduct in the period for which retroactive support is claimed entailing scrutiny of the respondent's ability to meet his or her support obligation during such period since the court may not impose retroactive support for an amount certain which, at the effective date of the commencement of the period covered by such retroactivity, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  it could not properly impose prospectively; the &quot;good cause&quot; test, while permitting support to be retroactive to a date other than the filing date of the petition or prospective only, also permits the holding of retroactive support &quot;in abeyance&quot; where directing payment forthwith in periodic sums, even in miniscule amounts, would work an undue hardship.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was originally charged with assault and criminal possession of a weapon. On the brink of trial, the district attorney reduced both charges to attempts under Cal. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 110.00, 120.00 and Cal. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 110.00, 265.01, respectively. The legal aid society challenged the district attorney's practice of reducing certain A misdemeanor cases, punishable by a maximum term of one year, to B misdemeanors, punishable by a maximum term of three months. The reduction was to deprive defendants of their right to a jury trial. The court decided that the district attorney could reduce substantive offenses to attempts where the allegations in the original information made out a completed act. Therefore, defendant's motion, based on the argument that the charges were hypothetical, was denied. Defendant faced only a three month incarceration, the charges were petty, and she was not entitled to a trial by jury. Defendant's motion attacking the district attorney's reduction procedure was denied in all respects. However, defendant's Clayton motion warranted a hearing to determine whether compelling factors existed warranting dismissal because of defendant's sarcoidosis condition.</SPAN></P>

The alleged father denied paternity and interposed that the mother's claim was barred by the two-year statute of limitations. Fam. Ct. Act. &sect; 517(a). The mother contended that the limitation period was tolled because the alleged father acknowledged paternity by supporting the child. On consideration, the court set the case for trial on the issue of paternity. The court found that the statute of limitations was not tolled by payment of support, because the evidence did not establish a pattern of support by alleged father which would clearly and unequivocally constitute an acknowledgment of paternity. However, the court held that &sect; 517(a) which allowed only two years after the birth of a child for filing of a paternity petition, was unconstitutional, in that the limitation violated the child's right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. The two-year limitation on paternity cases was not substantially related to the state interest of avoiding stale or fraudulent claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the professor was denied tenure, pursuant to N.Y. Educ.

Thereafter, the professor brought another action against the university, claiming the university had breached the employment contract, had violated the professor's constitutional rights, and had failed to justify its tenure denial. In partially granting the university's motion to dismiss, the court held a university was not required to give a non-tenured teacher its reasons for denying reappointment. Moreover, the court held the professor's constitutional claim should have been raised in the art. 78 proceeding; thus, it was barred by principles of res judicata. However, because the professor's contract claim was not assertable in an art. 78 proceeding, the court held the contract claim was not barred by res judicata. Furthermore, because the essence of the contract claim was a violation of the professor's constitutional rights, the court held the six-year residual limitations period of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 213(1) was applicable, rather than the shorter periods for statutory actions and art. 78 proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The city filed a reverse class action suit against defendants seeking a judgment declaring whether it could formulate a method of payment by which it could refund the unconstitutional taxes that had been paid by all defendants. After it was determined that only those defendants who had protested the taxes had a legal right to a refund, the appellate division remanded the suit to the court for a determination regarding the nonprotesting defendants. The court entered a judgment declaring that the city could refund the unconstitutional taxes that had been paid by the nonprotesting defendants. The court held that pursuant to N.Y. Gen. City Law &sect; 20(5), the city could authorize the refunds as equitable claims against the city.

Remission was barred by one-year statute of limitations in N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 540.30(2); however, the motion to vacate was timely because it claimed that the forfeiture was void for illegality. Petitioner had standing as one entitled to receive proceeds of exonerated bail. However, depositors of cash bail had fewer rights than sureties of bail bonds. Statutory discrimination was permitted, because no fundamental right was involved, and a rational basis test applied. In cash bail, the law looked to money already in possession of the state to insure defendant's appearance. The depositor was not entitled to notice because there was no &quot;taking.&quot; Furthermore, the depositor was assumed to have consented to grounds for cash forfeiture.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Although an application for bail remission addressed to the discretion of the court made more than one year after forfeiture of bail is untimely ( CPL 540.30, subd 2), the one-year time limitation is inapplicable to an application to vacate the forfeiture of bail when the forfeiture of bail is claimed to be unconstitutional or illegal and therefore void; an application for bail remission must set forth the extent of the applicant's resources and bare allegations of severe hardship and affidavits by attorneys representing applicants are insufficient to grant remission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bail -- Remission of Forfeiture -- Standing of Depositor of Cash Bail</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A depositor of cash bail, as opposed to a surety, has standing to make an application for bail remission since the statute (Judiciary Law, &sect; 798) does not restrict the category of persons who may make a remission application; a depositor of cash bail, as a person entitled to receive the proceeds of any exonerated bail (see General Municipal Law, &sect; 99-m) whom the court is &quot;bound to protect&quot;, has standing to seek vacatur of a cash bail forfeiture since the cash bail is deemed to be owned by the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant rather than the actual depositor only for purposes of the deposit until the criminal proceeding has been terminated after which time the actual depositor is deemed to be the owner with a superior right to the return of cash bail as against the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bail -- Forfeiture -- Cash Bail</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The New York statutory scheme giving depositors of cash bail fewer rights than sureties of bail bonds (see CPL 210.10, 530.80, subd 2; 540.10) is not violative of equal protection since the differences in the underlying theories behind bail bonds and cash bail, the law looking to the surety to guarantee the defendant's appearance in bail bonds while looking to the money already in the hands of the State to insure the defendant's appearance in cash bail, supply a rational basis for the distinctions in the rights, duties and obligations between bail bondsmen and depositors of cash bail; the failure in the statutory scheme to require that either prior notice of forfeiture or notice of &quot;taking&quot; after forfeiture be given to the depositor of cash bail is not violative of due process since the depositor has a duty to know what occurs in open court and therefore has constructive knowledge&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the actual forfeiture and there is also no due process requirement for notice of the &quot;taking&quot; of the cash bail after forfeiture since the money is already &quot;in the custody and control of the court&quot; and there is thus no &quot;taking&quot; of the depositor's property; the depositor of cash bail is &quot;assumed&quot; to know the exact circumstances in which the deposit might be irretrievably lost at the time the cash bail is posted and the depositor cannot be granted surety status by judicial fiat contrary to the clear legislative mandate nor does the fact that the cash receipt given to a depositor of cash bail states &quot;surety&quot; give such depositor a legal right not granted by statute and case law; the statutory scheme with regard to cash bail should be changed to at least grant depositors of cash bail the opportunity to surrender defendants at any time.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An action brought by the Attorney-General under subdivision 12 of section 63 of the Executive Law alleging that defendant car manufacturer engaged in fraudulent and unconscionable business practices by installing defective transmissions in its automobiles which it knew would fail shortly after the expiration of its new-car 12,000-mile limited warranty period states a cause of action under the statute since the statute, although usually applied to activities such as pyramid sales, bait and switch sales and misleading advertising, also encompasses a consumer product complaint where the essence of the suit is not the quality of the product per se, but the knowledge of the defect and the attempt to limit liability by means of concealment and limited warranties for the defective product; the complaint also states a cause of action for an unconscionable contractual provision&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and a deceptive warranty practice since knowledge of the nature of the defect would have adversely affected a consumer's decision to purchase one of defendant's cars; the fact that statute has not previously been applied in the context of a breach of warranty in a consumer product transaction does not render the statute as applied unconstitutionally vague since the statute is sufficiently clear in describing the type of commercial activity which is to be enjoined; the action for breach of implied warranty for economic loss only must be dismissed since such an action could not have been brought against defendant by individual consumers due to the lack of privity between defendant and the consumers; the fact that there are several other suits pending involving substantially the same issues does not warrant a stay of this action at this time.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner niece brought an application against respondent, executrix and stepdaughter, seeking a determination that two Totten trust bank accounts established by decedent had been revoked pursuant to the terms of the decedent's will.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During his lifetime, decedent created two Totten trust bank accounts, the proceeds of which constituted substantially all of his assets. These accounts were established prior to the execution of the will and designated his stepdaughter as beneficiary upon his death. The niece argued that the Totten trust bank accounts were revoked by the provisions of the will. The niece conceded that the accounts at issue were not revoked in accordance with the requirements of N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 7-5.2 but argued that either the statute was inapplicable to the accounts, or, if applicable, it was unconstitutional. The court concluded that: (1) merely because a Totten trust bank account was created prior to the effective date of part 5 of N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts &sect; 7, the statute in no way impaired any vested right where the decedent had died subsequent to the effective date of the statute and left a will that was also executed subsequent to that date; and (2) the accounts were both payable to the stepdaughter without the stepdaughter's automatic right to the accounts upon the death of decedent being in any respect impaired by decedent's subsequent execution of his will.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A Totten trust bank account created by decedent after the effective date of part 5 of EPTL article 7 is not exempt from application of the article as a result of the language of EPTL 7-5.7 which provides that the statute is applicable to &quot;all funds in trust accounts * * * which are in existence on its effective date&quot;; such reference is not a limitation of the statute to only such accounts, but a simple explicit rebuttal by the Legislature of the presumption that all legislation is simply prospective, and to construe the statute otherwise would frustrate its clear purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trusts -- Totten Trust -- Constitutionality of Application of EPTL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The application of EPTL 7-5.2 to a Totten trust bank account created before the statute's effective date and allegedly revoked by the terms of decedent creator's will does not constitute, by ex post facto legislation, an unconstitutional impairment of a contractual relationship between the decedent and the depository where he created the account; the application of the statute to a trust account created by decedent who died subsequent to its effective date and left a will that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was also executed subsequent to that date did not impair any vested right since the decedent creator's right to revoke the designation of beneficiary at will at the depository did not confer upon decedent a vested right to revoke the account by testamentary instrument without regard to the statutory requirements for such an act, where such requirements were a part of the law at the time the instrument was executed, even if the requirements were created subsequent to the establishment of the account; there is no vested right in existing legislation or rules of law that precludes a change or repeal by the Legislature so long as it does not impair an already vested property right. </SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. 2214(d) and 7804(c). The court denied the county's motion to dismiss. The individuals erroneously brought their action under N.Y.

The court directed the proceed to be converted to a declaratory judgment action and issued a declaration of the parties' rights. 1983 N.Y.

Penal Law &sect; 221.30. At issue before the court was whether an incongruity in the law that required a more severe punishment for defendant than would be imposed on a similarly situated person in possession of the same drug in concentrated form rendered N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.00(4)&nbsp;unconstitutional as violative of the 14th Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to defendant's plea bargain, the prosecutor was to recommend five years' probation and six months' jail time. But before sentencing, it was found that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.00(4) did not apply to marihuana cases and that the minimum statutory prison term was one year. The trial court sentenced defendant pursuant to the prosecutor's recommendation, holding that it would violate the 14th Amendment to give the longer sentence. Applying the rational basis test, the court concluded that there was no legitimate State purpose in affording different and discriminatory treatment to persons sentenced for offenses under N.Y. Penal Law art. 221 as opposed to those sentenced for offenses under art. 220 for the commission of more serious crimes of the same general nature. The court held that unless N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.00(4) was read to include class C felonies under art. 221, such as defendant's, that &sect; 70.00(4) would be unconstitutional. The obvious legislative intent was to include those offenses, and they were excluded only because of a palpable legislative oversight.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the felony committed by defendant was intended to be included in the sentencing law and, accordingly, sentenced defendant to six months' imprisonment to run concurrently and as a condition of a sentence of five years' probation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sponsors brought an action against defendant mayor challenging the constitutionality of New York City, N.Y., Admin.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The code regulated the conversion of rental units in the city to co-operative or condominium status. The code required that the sponsor of a conversion establish a reserve fund for repairs or improvements and post housing violations. Under N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 352-e (statute), the attorney general promulgated rules for the submission of conversion plans. Those rules did not require reserve funds or the posting of violations. The court held that the code was neither inconsistent with nor preempted by state law. Only if the state evidenced a desire to exclusively occupy an entire filed was the city powerless to act. But the statute was essentially a disclosure law of facts needed to guide investors. The fact that state law did not require posting and reserve funds did not render the code inconsistent with state law. Inconsistency required that the municipal law contradicted or was incompatible with state law. The code supplemented the state regulatory process and met the city's special housing problems. Thus, the court denied the corporation's motion and granted the mayor' cross-motion.</SPAN></P>

A witness who would testify that defendant was at the scene of the crime was not such an alibi rebuttal witness.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the charges against him for obscenity in violation of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant operated a bar. A police officer entered the bar and observed naked dancers and a sexually explicit movie. Based upon the officer's observations and without obtaining a warrant, police officers entered the bar and seized videotapes containing sexually explicit material. Defendant was charged with promoting prostitution in violation of &sect; 245.02 and obscenity in violation of &sect; 235.05. Defendant filed a motion challenging the constitutionality of the statutes and seeking to suppress the videotapes from his trial. Upon review, the court upheld the statutes and granted defendant's motion to suppress the videotapes. The court held that defendant did not have standing to challenge the definition of obscenity in &sect; 235.05 based upon its inclusion of sadism and masochism because he was not charged with promoting sadism or masochism. The court ruled that &sect; 245.02 did not violate the equal protection clause by referring only to nudity by females. The court held that communicative materials could not be seized solely based upon a police officer's conclusion that the materials were obscene, so the warrantless seizure of the videotapes was unlawful.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant, charged with obscenity for showing movies depicting obscene sexual acts in his bar (Penal Law, &sect; 235.05, subd 1), permitting prostitution (Penal Law, &sect; 230.40) and promoting the exposure of a female (Penal Law, &sect; 245.02) for permitting females to walk naked about his bar, may not challenge the obscenity statute on the ground that the inclusion of sadism and masochism renders the statute overbroad since that part of the statute has no application to the charges against him; the use of the phrases &quot;contemporary community standards&quot; and &quot;patently offensive manner&quot; in the definition of obscenity (Penal Law, &sect; 235.00), consistent with the standards and guidelines established by the United States Supreme Court in obscenity cases, does not render the obscenity statutes unconstitutional for vagueness since the statutes are more than adequate to advise as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices; the statute proscribing promoting the exposure&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of a female is not unconstitutionally overbroad since the exposure of the female body in furtherance of artistic pursuits and endeavors is not threatened by the statute nor is the statute violative of equal protection for dealing solely with the exposure of females; the charge of aiding and abetting prostitution is not invalid merely because there is no allegation that defendant failed to make reasonable efforts to halt or abate the prostitution since that neglect is fairly implied from the claim that he facilitated prostitution on his premises.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Communicative materials such as writings and films, being protected by the First Amendment, may not ordinarily be seized without a warrant and warrants to seize such material may not be issued if the determination of obscenity is made solely by a police officer without close judicial supervision and scrutiny unless there are &quot;exigent circumstances&quot; in which police action must be &quot;now or never&quot; to preserve the evidence of the crimes; accordingly, films depicting allegedly obscene sexual acts which were seized from defendant's bar without a warrant by police officers who had&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  previously watched the films on the bar's television screen must be suppressed since there were no &quot;exigent circumstances&quot; which justified the warrantless search and seizure inasmuch as the police officers had ample opportunity to describe the films to a Judge and to thereby obtain a warrant for the seizure nor were the films so unidentifiable that they were incapable of being specifically described in a warrant.  </SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. 6515, to cancel the notice of pendency plaintiff company filed against a building owned by defendant. Plaintiff opposed the motion to cancel and cross-moved for leave to conduct discovery regarding the circumstances surrounding defendant's acquisition of the subject building.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff company sought to impose a constructive trust upon the property of defendant property owner, but provided no allegations as to how the corporate funds were diverted to enable defendant to purchase the subject property. Defendant came forward with substantial evidence indicating that no such diversion of funds took place and made a motion pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 6514(b) or alternatively N.Y. C.P.L.R. 6515, to cancel the notice of pendency. In its cross-motion, plaintiff acknowledged the court's authority to consider the merits of its claim, and requested leave to conduct further discovery to adequately respond to the allegations raised by defendant. The court held that where a substantial question was raised by a defendant intent on selling as to whether the property which was the subject of the lis pendens was also, truly, the subject of the plaintiff's action, a court was constitutionally required to determine that claim. The court granted the cross-motion for leave to conduct discovery and stated that upon completion of the discovery, defendant could renew her motion to cancel the notice of pendency.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that it had a constitutional obligation to provide defendant property owner with an opportunity for a review of the notice of pendency on the merits.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent father's application to vacate the registration of a foreign child support order is denied and the order is confirmed (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 37-a), where a Maryland court filed and forwarded to a New York Family Court a divorce decree which incorporated but did not merge the parties' separation agreement containing a specific provision for child support; whether Maryland law permits the parties to modify the support obligation in the separation agreement without court approval is not relevant in the instant case, as the filing and forwarding of the papers containing the separation agreement indicates that the particular modification bears the imprimatur of the Maryland court.  Further, the fact that arrears may eventually be sought also does not preclude registration and, in any event, registration would not entitle petitioner to arrears, which may be sought in a supplementary proceeding following registration. Finally, section 37-a of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Domestic Relations Law is not unconstitutional on the ground that it permits enforcement without due notice or an opportunity to be heard, since the statute affords a respondent mail notice of registration; moreover, a respondent against whom a judgment was entered in another State was presumably subject to the jurisdiction of the foreign court and given a full and fair opportunity to defend the underlying action.  </SPAN></P>

In so ruling, the court observed that the property owner did not plead that he was not diligent in the payment of his taxes or that the property was exempt. As such, the city made out a prima facie case. The court rejected the property owner's claim that he was entitled to a set-off noting that New York City, N.Y., Admin.

The court rejected the natural father's constitutional arguments. The court then held that, upon the evidence, including that there had been a prolonged interruption of the natural father's custody and visitation that was not entirely attributable to blameworthy conduct by the natural mother, that the child was integrated into a new family unit, and that it was doubtful that the child had any recollection of the natural father, the best interests of the child required that an order of adoption be entered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People requested that a hearing be held pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 400.16 to determine whether defendant was a persistent violent felony offender. Defendant, through his attorney, answered the motion contending that the persistent felony offender statute was unconstitutional as violative of the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted, after a nonjury trial, of attempted murder in the second-degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the second-degree, grand larceny in the third degree, and criminal mischief in the fourth degree. Accordingly, the People requested that the court find defendant to be a violent felony offender. A two-prong test had been established to assist in the determination. The two-prong test asked whether defendant was convicted of a N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.02(1) violent felony offense; and had defendant previously been subjected to two or more predicate violent felony convictions within the meaning of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.04(1). Since both attempted murder in the second degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree were violent felony offenses as defined in N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.02(1), the first prong of the two-prong test had been satisfied. However, the court found that defendant was not a violent felony offender at the time of his hearing because defendant's manslaughter convictions did not meet the second prong of the test; the sentence for the latter two convictions was imposed contemporaneously with the first.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that defendant did not qualify for treatment as a persistent violent felony offender. Based upon that determination, it was unnecessary to address defendant's contention that a determination of persistent felony offender was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant cannot be sentenced as a persistent violent felony offender (Penal Law, &sect; 70.08) on the basis of three prior manslaughter convictions for which he received concurrent sentences upon his guilty pleas to three counts of a single indictment since a prior conviction is deemed a predicate violent felony conviction only if sentence &quot;upon such prior conviction&quot; was imposed &quot;before commission of the present felony&quot; (Penal Law, &sect; 70.04, subd 1, par [b], cl [ii]) and defendant's convictions do not, therefore, constitute &quot;two or more predicate violent felony convictions&quot; necessary for persistent violent felony offender treatment inasmuch as the sentence for the latter two convictions was imposed contemporaneously with the first.  </SPAN></P>

The corporation requested a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was unconstitutional. It contended that the ordinance denied it from carrying on its brick restoration business and that the ordinance had no rational basis in its application. The city moved to dismiss the action. The court granted the motion. The evidence demonstrated that the city had a reasonable apprehension that abrasive methods to remove paint from brick surfaces damaged the bisque or outer covering of the brick and thereby were harmful or destructive to rehabilitation and renovations to brick buildings. Although the corporation's method caused less damage than other abrasive methods, it fell within the category of abrasives and did in fact remove the bisque. The corporation failed to overcome the presumption that the ordinance was constitutional. Further, that the ordinance did not prohibit other methods was not an equal protection violation. The evidence was that the abrasive method was entirely different from other methods.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state enacted a tax law on certain capital gains and the taxpayers paid the taxes. Thereafter, the state repealed the law and made the repeal retroactive to the effective date of the law thereby wiping it out as if it had never existed. Two of the taxpayers filed written requests for return of the taxes paid and one filed an action, prior to the laws repeal, to have the statute declared unconstitutional. Thereafter, all of the taxpayers filed actions for repayment of the tax. The State admitted the taxpayers were entitled to a refund but asserted that no mechanism was in place to refund the money and that the court lacked jurisdiction because the law was never declared unconstitutional. The court granted the refunds and held that it had jurisdiction to grant a money judgment because the actions for money had and received, though based upon equitable principals, were deemed actions in law. The failure of the State to put in place an administrative provision for the refund of the taxes did not prevent the court from granting the refunds, which were admittedly due.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff tenant brought an action against defendant landlord to declare that the landlord waived any breach of the lease and that the Loft Law, N.Y.

The landlord filed motions to dismiss the harassment and fraud causes, to strike the attorney's fees demand, and to direct the tenant to pay use and occupancy. The tenant obtained an order to stay eviction proceedings and sought an injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties' lease required the tenant to use the premises as a photo studio. The tenant converted the space for joint living-working use. The landlord served a notice to cure. The court stayed the landlord from taking any steps to evict the tenant and tolled the running of the time under the notice to cure, provided that the tenant posted a bond and paid current use and occupancy and any arrears. The court found that (1) the tenant's motion for a preliminary injunction was viable, (2) the landlord's motion to dismiss the tenant's original complaint was moot, (3) his motion attacking the tenant's amended complaint was procedurally proper, (4) the landlord's constitutional attack on the Loft Law was both theoretical and premature, (5) injunctive relief for the landlord was not proper, (6) the landlord was estopped from relying on the lease's no-waiver clause, and (7) the tenant's harassment and fraud claims failed. The landlord allegedly instigated and participated in the tenant's breach of the lease's use and occupancy covenant by telling the tenant at the commencement of the lease that he could reside on the premises and by taking rent knowing that the tenant lived there.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the tenant's motion for a preliminary injunction with conditions, granted in part and denied in part the landlord's motion to dismiss, and denied the landlord's motion challenging the constitutionality of the Loft Law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff tenant's service of an amended complaint does not affect the viability of his motion for a preliminary injunction brought under the original complaint requiring defendant landlord to stay efforts to enforce a notice to cure or to evict plaintiff because of his residential use of commercial loft premises since the pleading need not be annexed to the motion for a preliminary injunction when it is not sought on the basis of a cause of action for a permanent injunction and, consequently, the amendment of the pleading during the pendency of the motion, in a manner of no consequence to the application for a preliminary injunction can have no effect on its consideration; service of the amended complaint does not circumvent the motion addressed to the sufficiency of the original complaint and the court should address the amended pleading especially where defendant has made a second CPLR 3211 (subd [a], par 7) motion attacking the amended complaint; the single-motion rule of CPLR 3211 (subd [e]) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is not offended when the second motion raised the ground of CPLR 3211 (subd [a], par 7) since a motion on this ground may be made at any time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiff tenant, who was served with a notice to cure his residential use of the demised loft premises in violation of the lease which provided that the premises were to be used only for a photo studio, has adequately pleaded the applicability of the new Loft Law (Multiple Dwelling Law, art 7-C) since the Loft Law, designed to protect residents of certain &quot;interim multiple dwellings&quot; that had previously been used for commercial purposes from eviction, is not limited to only artists and the question of whether three families lived in the building and whether residential use could be permitted by administrative certification cannot be resolved on the face of the pleading; defendant landlord's constitutional attack on the Loft Law based upon the claim that the law &quot;denies the landlord the right to collect rent unless interim multiple dwelling status is conceded&quot; is both theoretical and premature since the landlord's interest can be protected by conditioning injunctive relief&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in favor of tenants upon their payment of rent; plaintiff is entitled to injunctive relief in order to preserve his right to cure should he be in error regarding his joint living-working uses of the premises since plaintiff can cure without vacating the premises by simply discontinuing his residential use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Loft Law -- No-Waiver Clause -- Retaliatory Eviction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A no-waiver clause of a lease of loft premises which provides that the landlord's receipt of rent knowing of a breach does not constitute a waiver of that breach, the lease having limited the use of the premises for a photo studio, does not mandate dismissal of plaintiff tenant's waiver claim based upon defendant landlord's acceptance of rent with knowledge of plaintiff's residential use of the premises since defendant's alleged instigation and participation in the offending condition from the inception of the lease is so pervasive and active that it may be estopped from relying on the no-waiver clause; plaintiff, who was only served with a notice to cure his residential occupancy, does not state a cause of action for retaliatory eviction or harassment (Real Property Law, &sect;&sect; 223-b, 235-d) based&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  upon his efforts to secure protection under the new Loft Law (Multiple Dwelling Law, art 7-C) since the prohibited conduct does not embrace the landlord's attempt to enforce its legal rights under the literal wording of the lease; plaintiff's allegations that defendant falsely represented that his residential use would be permitted does not state a cause of action for fraud and since plaintiff is not alleging the breach of any covenant under the lease by the landlord, the existence of a clause in the lease in favor of the landlord for attorney's fees does not trigger plaintiff's right to recover attorney's fees (Real Property Law, &sect; 234).  </SPAN></P>

Laws 598 were invalid on the grounds that they were violative of the Urstadt Amendment, 1971 N.Y. Laws 372, they exceeded the authority granted the city by N.Y. Real Prop.

Laws 598 were unconstitutional because they did not fully reimburse the landlords for the rent exemptions required therein.

The City of New York should fully subsidize housing for its senior citizens by spreading the cost among the public taxpayers versus singling out individual landlords particularly in the event that the dollar amount of rent increase exemptions exceeds the total real estate tax offsets allowed in one year, thus causing landlords to incur losses that may not be recouped in a carry over tax abatement for the following year.

The landlord claimed that he never received this notice and that he first became aware of the violation when he received an order to show cause. The administrative code, New York City, N.Y. Admin. Code. &sect; D26-51.01(k) (1981), created a legal presumption that a condition constituting a violation continued from the day when the notice was posted until the landlord proved it had been corrected. The landlord argued that merely posting the sticker in the public hallway was not adequate notice for due process purposes to subject him to penalties based on the presumption of a continuing violation from the date of that notice. The court agreed. The court noted that, in addition to the posting of notice, there had previously been a requirement that notice be mailed to the person in charge of the premises or the owner or agent of any violation but that such requirement had been eliminated. Absent such a requirement, the court held that &sect; D26-51.01(k) did not meet the test of procedural due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery in the second degree and assault in the second degree and faced sentence as a persistent violent felony offender pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.08. Defendant objected to being so classified arguing the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him because it was in effect an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced in June 1977 and received 2 to 6 years on each indictment, said terms to run concurrently. On September 1, 1978, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.02 was enacted defining violent felony offenses which required minimum sentences. Although criminal possession of a weapon, third degree, was not at that time included, further amendment of the statute in 1980 did include that crime. The court stated that both &sect; 70.02 as amended and N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.08 were enacted after defendant was sentenced. The issue was whether subjecting him to a persistent violent offender sentence for the conviction that occurred in November of 1982 was in fact ex post facto because it unconstitutionally elevated the degree of his punishment. The court held that it was not. There was no difference in legislative intent between the persistent violent offender statute,&nbsp;&sect; 70.08, and N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.02, which defined violent felony offenses requiring minimum sentences of imprisonment. Both enhanced punishment to recidivists - a compelling State interest. The manner in which defendant's prior sentences were imposed was totally irrelevant for the purpose of determining violent felony offender status.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court adjudicated defendant as a persistent violent felony offender and he was sentenced to a term of 8 years to life imprisonment, the minimum for a class D felony under the statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree was not defined as a violent felony offense under section 70.02 of the Penal Law at the time of defendant's conviction of three counts of said crime; however, these convictions may properly serve as prior violent felony convictions under the amended statute, subjecting defendant to enhanced sentencing as a persistent violent felony offender pursuant to section 70.08 of the Penal Law upon his subsequent conviction of robbery in the second degree and assault in the second degree. The statute is not an ex post facto law as applied to defendant, since section 70.02, as amended, and section 70.08 of the Penal Law were in force and effect prior to defendant's commission of the act for which he now faces sentencing and section 70.08 increases punishment for the present violation only; further, the fact that the sentences imposed upon defendant's prior, multiple convictions ran concurrently, does not alter his status as an individual with two or more previous violent felony convictions.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislation provided for transfer of monies from the SIF, which provided workers' compensation insurance, to the New York State General Fund. Upon consideration, the court granted the administrators' motion for summary judgment. The court held that ch. 55 and ch. 404 did not impair any contractual obligation to the policyholders because prospective losses of dividends under future policies were not within the impairment clause. The court also held that the policyholder had no protected property interest in the SIF because it was a state agency whose monies belonged to the state. The court additionally noted that property was not being taken but only transferred. The court found that an improper debt was not created because the SIF was a state agency so, therefore, no debt was created by the state in favor of a separate entity. The court held that the legislation did not create an improper tax because the policyholders were not forced to make a contribution. The court noted that, even if the legislation created a tax, it would be permissible as a special tax on one class of property.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the accused's guilty plea barred a cause of action for malicious prosecution. The court denied summary judgment on the claims for negligence and a violation of &sect; 1983 because proper issues of material fact were demonstrated by the accused. The court found that the negligence alleged was not the mistaken issuance of a summons, but rather the failure to make known to the accused that the summons with appearance was required. The court held that the fact that there were grounds for the summons issuance and that the accused pled guilty did not bar her from contending that the warrant which resulted in her detention would not have been issued if defendants acted properly, including informing her that a dog license was required.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Sentencing of a defendant who pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a weapon, third degree, as a second violent felony offender based upon a conviction obtained prior to the effective date of the violent felony legislation does not violate defendant's due process rights or the ex post facto prohibition since reliance upon the prior conviction serves only to enhance defendant's sentence for his present crime and not to retroactively increase the penalty for the predicate offense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Second Violent Felony Offender -- Constitutionality of Previous Conviction -- Burden of Proof</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The ultimate burden of proof as to the constitutionality of a conviction relied on as the basis for sentencing a defendant as a predicate violent felony offender is upon the People since the fair import of CPL 400.15 (subd 7, par [a]) is that the defendant is first required to specify the nature of his constitutional challenge and offer proof in support thereof and, at that point, the People's burden to disprove the challenge becomes operative.  Accordingly, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the court found that the defendant had been properly subjected to a predicate violent felony conviction for the purpose of sentencing him as a second felony offender where defendant failed to come forward with any proof as to the unconstitutionality of the predicate conviction thereby never making operative the People's burden to disprove defendant's challenge to the conviction's constitutionality; moreover, even if defendant was to have no burden of coming forward, his challenge must fail since, whether the People's burden of proof is held to be one of &quot;clear and convincing evidence&quot;, or a &quot;preponderance of the credible evidence&quot;, that burden is met by the presumption of regularity in court proceedings as buttressed by the testimony of the Justice who presided at the taking of defendant's plea that, although he had no specific recollection of the proceeding, it was his unvarying practice in accepting guilty pleas to advise a defendant of those constitutional rights which he waives by a guilty plea.  </SPAN></P>

Penal Law &sect;&sect; 220.25(1) and 265.15(3), to dismiss an indictment accusing him of possessing a controlled substance and weapon found in an automobile that he was driving for hire, while operating on a suspended license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for criminal possession of a controlled substance and a weapon, after police retrieved the items from the vehicle that defendant was driving for hire. At the time, defendant's license was allegedly suspended. Defendant claimed that the statute afforded him an exemption from the presumption that the presence of a controlled substance and a firearm in a vehicle was evidence of its possession by all of its occupants. The prosecutor argued that while defendant's license was suspended at the time of the incident, he was not duly licensed and therefore was not exempt from the statute. The court held that the statutory presumption could not be sustained if there was no rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed. The court found that defendant was a duly licensed operator within the purview of the exceptions. Thus, the presumptions were not applicable and the indictment, based on erroneous legal instructions, had to be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presumption of knowing possession of a controlled substance (Penal Law, &sect; 220.25, subd 1) and of a firearm (Penal Law, &sect; 265.15, subd 3) by all who occupy a vehicle at the time such contraband is found is inapplicable to a duly licensed driver for hire since there is no reasonable basis to presume that such a driver is aware of the presence of contraband and culpably involved in its possession in a vehicle not necessarily owned by him, not accessible exclusively to him, and used by passengers not ordinarily known to him.  Accordingly, said presumption is inapplicable to such a driver whose license has been temporarily suspended since such a driver can no more reasonably be said to have been aware of and culpably involved in the possession of such contraband than his counterpart with a currently valid license and, therefore, it was error for the District Attorney to instruct the Grand Jury that it could apply said presumptions in indicting such a driver for possession of an unlicensed firearm and a quantity of a controlled substance allegedly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  recovered by police from the rear of the vehicle he was operating.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner individuals sought review of respondent Department of Consumer Affairs of the City of New York's (department) revocation of the individuals' common show licenses for the operation of video games. The individuals challenged the constitutionality of the department's regulation governing the city's licensing of common shows, contending that the regulation was unconstitutionally vague and its application had been arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the petition, holding that the regulation was not void for vagueness. The court held that the test for determining whether a regulation was void for vagueness was whether persons of common intelligence must have necessarily guessed at its meaning and differed as to its application. The court held that the regulation clearly set forth that no common show license should have been issued for an establishment within 200 feet of an elementary or secondary public or private school. The court concluded that the fact that a precise method of measurement was not contained in the statute did not render the regulation unconstitutionally vague. Further, the court held that the application of the regulation was not arbitrary or capricious. The court held that there was a rational basis for the regulation because it was not unreasonable or irrational for the department to restrict the licensing of the games near schools.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A regulation of the Department of Consumer Affairs of the City of New York stating that no license for common show games, which include video games (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; B32-40.0), shall be issued for an establishment located within 200 feet of a private or public elementary or secondary school, is constitutional: (1) the regulation does not infringe upon conduct protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution; (2) there is a rational basis for the regulation, and (3) the regulation is not unconstitutional for vagueness by reason of the fact that no method of measurement is contained in the regulation. Furthermore, the Commissioner of the Consumer Affairs Department acted within his authority in directing that said distance be measured from building line or property line to building line, whichever is the shortest distance between the licensed premises and a school, rather than from door to door. Accordingly, since it is undisputed that petitioners' premises are within 200 feet of a school, as measured by respondent's inspectors, the revocation of their common&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  show licenses was not arbitrary or capricious and will not be disturbed; petitioners' CPLR article 78 proceeding was converted into a declaratory judgment action insofar as it challenged the constitutionality of the regulation. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayers brought the action for assessment review against respondent Commissioner of Assessment of the City of Syracuse, New York. The taxpayers filed a motion for summary judgment on issues involving State equalization rates applied to the City of Syracuse for nine years, the constitutionality of limiting interest on tax refunds, and their entitlement to additional allowances under N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 722(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers brought the challenge to their property assessments and filed a motion for summary judgment. The court first found that proof of the State equalization rate was sufficient to establish a prima facie case of the validity of the assessment ratio, pursuant to 1981 N.Y. Laws ch. 1057, &sect; 7, but that evidence of the State rate was not conclusive of the validity of the ratio. The City was not precluded from questioning the validity of the State rate. The court also ruled that the City was not estopped from challenging the State rate, except with regard to years in which it was deemed valid through litigation. Because the State rate was deemed valid for four of the years in question, the court granted the taxpayers' motion for summary judgment for tax assessments issued during those years. The court then concluded that the taxpayers were entitled to be made whole for any overassessment. This included interest on the overpayments, at a reasonable rate that was not limited to 3 percent under N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 3-a. The taxpayers were also entitled to additional allowances after offering sufficient proof, as required under N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 722(2).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a real property tax assessment review proceeding, petitioners' contention that the State equalization rates for the years 1972 through 1980 are the proper rates to be applied to the City of Syracuse on the ground that existing court decisions have established that the proof of the State rate is conclusive is without merit since existing authority provides that the State rate alone is sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case but does not preclude the taxing authority from questioning the validity of the State rate and, thus, it is not conclusive ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Guth Realty v Gingold</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 34 NY2d 440); however, the taxing authority is estopped from contesting the State rate for those years in which that rate has been fully litigated or for which the taxing authority has admitted its validity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Assessment -- Court's Power to Compensate for Overassessment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. There is no indication that in enacting section 3-a of the General Municipal Law the Legislature intended to pre-empt the field of compensation for overassessment of tax and, in addition, the court has general equitable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  power, which the Legislature may not usurp, to provide just compensation for an overassessment of tax regardless of the taxing authority's motive in levying such overassessment. Accordingly, in a real property tax assessment review proceeding, the court is competent, pursuant to said equitable power, to provide just compensation, as equity requires, in the form of a fair and reasonable interest rate for any amounts improperly collected, and the readily determinable interest rate for the tax anticipation notes with which municipalities often fund their everyday operations provides a reasonable basis for establishing the interest rate for the tax refunds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Assessment -- Additional Allowance for Unlawful Overassessment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A municipality's failure to comply with the statutory mandate to assess real property at its fair market value and its repeated imposition of unlawful assessments against a petitioner's property represent precisely the abuse which the Legislature sought to correct when it enacted subdivision 2 of section 722 of the Real Property Tax Law which provides an additional allowance for a taxpayer whose property has been wrongfully overassessed and, therefore, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in a real property tax assessment review proceeding, petitioner may establish its right to such penalty allowance by offering proof that it has been so treated by respondent municipality. </SPAN></P>

Soon after, the process server mailed a copy of the summons with notice to the address given by plaintiff. The driver filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff's complaint because the trial court did not obtain personal jurisdiction over him because the address that plaintiff gave to the process server was correct, but the city was incorrect. The court granted the driver's motion for an order dismissing the complaint and denied plaintiff's cross motion for an order dismissing the third and fifth affirmative defenses set forth in the driver's answer. The court took judicial notice of matters that related to the mail.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with criminal possession of a weapon, stolen property, and bribery. He sought to suppress evidence of a weapon obtained from the trunk of a car, as well as a statement he made, claiming they fell within the exclusionary rule.

The court found that the police acted in good faith in relying on defendant's act of consent in opening the trunk and permitting them to look inside. The good-faith error by the police, which was judgmental, did not require application of the exclusionary rule. Moreover, in such cases, there was a societal interest in the prosecution of a person charged with possessing and transporting automatic weapons. Also, there was a diminished right of privacy in a parked vehicle. The bribe offer was not suppressed because it was an independent act, and was not a spontaneous reaction to an unlawful search after arrest.</SPAN></P>

The People filed a persistent violent felony offender statement under &sect;&sect; 400.15, 400.16(2), and defendant objected on the grounds that his two prior violent felony convictions had been obtained unconstitutionally. Specifically, he alleged that he had not realized the constitutional rights that he was waiving by negotiating the pleas and bargaining sentences in the prior proceedings. The trial court concluded that the two prior violent felony convictions could not be used in a determination that defendant was a persistent violent felony offender because the prior convictions were constitutionally infirm. Both times that defendant pleaded guilty, he was not advised of each of his constitutional rights. His lack of knowledge rendered those convictions unconstitutional. Defendant testified that he had not been aware of the constitutional rights that he was waiving; he only knew that he was being offered shorter sentences and that had been the basis for his acceptance of the pleas. The People failed to introduce any evidence to controvert the contention that he had not knowingly waived his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant's sentence upon his third violent felony conviction is subject to enhancement since the offense for which he currently stands convicted was committed at a time when violent and second felony offender laws had become effective ( CPL 400.15, 400.16); such a sentence does not increase the punishment for acts committed prior to the effective date of said laws in violation of the constitutional prohibition of ex post facto laws.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant's failure to challenge the constitutionality of his original violent felony conviction when he was arraigned as a second felony offender would ordinarily be deemed a waiver of his right to challenge that conviction; however, where defendant asserts that he was told by his attorney that he could only challenge whether he was the person named in the predicate felony statement and this is supported by the fact that the court did not inform him that he had a right to controvert the constitutionality of the prior conviction, defendant did not waive his right to challenge the constitutionality of the prior convictions and he&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  can raise the issue upon his third violent felony conviction when a persistent violent felony offender statement is filed against him.</SPAN></P>

When a defendant pleads guilty to a crime, no special litany or specific allocution of the constitutional rights he is waiving is required; however, the waiver of those rights must be knowing and voluntary.  Accordingly, defendant's prior convictions cannot be used in a determination that defendant is a persistent violent felony offender ( CPL 400.16) where he asserts that he was not made aware of the constitutional rights he waived by negotiating pleas on two prior violent felony convictions, stating that he knew only that the sentences offered were less than the sentences he might receive if he were found guilty at trial, and the People have failed to controvert this contention.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted New York City, N.Y., Local Laws No. 74 (1982) as a means of protecting tourists, who frequented the midtown Manhattan area, from being overcharged for camera and video equipment and Persian rugs. The association filed an action contending that New York City, N.Y., Local Laws No. 74 (1982) was unconstitutional and moved for an injunction to restrain its enforcement. In denying the motion, the court held that the association was not likely to succeed in the action. In so deciding, the court held that: (1) the city's use of size and geographic location in New York City, N.Y., Local Laws No. 74 (1982) did not violate equal protection; (2) although the licensing requirements of New York City, N.Y., Local Laws No. 74 (1982) only pertained to smaller merchants within a three square block area, the city was entitled to implement its program step by step with the ultimate goal of enacting regulations to eliminate the overcharging problem in all areas; and (3) the association was unlikely to have been able to sustain its burden of proving that the city's economic regulation was not reasonably calculated to serve a proper governmental purpose.</SPAN></P>

Section 147-2 mirrored the language of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.25(2), the State statute defining the offense of harassment, except that the ordinance was confined to police officers while the State statute made no distinction. The ordinance was enacted to fill a perceived gap in the law created by judicial interpretations of the State statute, which required measurement of the offensiveness of the language against the sensibilities of the ordinary, reasonable police officer, rather than the ordinary reasonable man. Defendants argued that the city council had no authority to enact the ordinance. The court found no intention either legislatively or judicially to confine the protection of &sect; 240.25(2) to private citizens, and thus concluded that the State had preempted the entire area of offenses covered by that statute.

The court found that the employees were not entitled to summary judgment, noting that the statute was constitutional on its face, and there was no evidence that the employees' dues were being impermissibly used to further the association's ideological activities or that resort to the association's refund mechanism would have been inefficacious or inequitable.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. With respect to plaintiff nonunion employees' contention that by allowing the deduction from wages of agency shop fees equal to defendant union's dues, section 208 (subd 3, par [b]) of the Civil Service Law permits agency shop fee deductions exceeding plaintiffs' pro rata share of collective bargaining expenses to be used by the union, at least temporarily, for impermissible purposes, it is clear that there is no constitutional infirmity in the authorization by section 208 (subd 3, par [b]) of an agency shop fee equal to the union's dues ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Railway Employees' Dept. v Hanson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 351 U.S. 225). The present record is devoid of hard evidence showing how defendant union actually used the agency shop fees of plaintiff nonunion employees. The holding in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Hanson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) requires the presumption that fees will be used only for permissible purposes and, accordingly, the exaction of an agency shop fee equal to union dues is not unconstitutional per se.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Service -- Employee Organizations -- Agency Shop Fee Deduction Refund Procedure -- Constitutionality </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiff&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  nonunion employees' contention that the agency shop fee deduction refund procedure authorized by section 208 (subd 3, par [b]) of the Civil Service Law inhibits their First Amendment rights and is equivalent to a prior restraint upon speech, and that agency shop fees should be deposited in escrow until the union proves to a court, or to the New York Public Employment Relations Board, how much of the fee represents plaintiffs' pro rata share of the collective bargaining expenses which are properly deductible, misperceives the nature of plaintiffs' rights.  A dissenting nonunion employee is aggrieved not by the union's receipt of his agency shop fee, but only by its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">use</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for impermissible purposes, and until a prima facie showing of unauthorized use is made there is no reason to deny the union control over the full agency shop fee.  The escrow requirement which plaintiffs seek to engraft upon the statute would amount to a forbidden injunction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Service -- Employee Organizations -- Agency Shop Fee Deduction Refund Procedure -- Constitutionality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It cannot be determined, on the present record, whether the defendant union's internal agency shop fee deduction rebate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  procedure impermissibly shifts the burden of proof to plaintiff nonunion employees, since the record lacks evidence that plaintiffs' agency shop fees are improperly used and is also devoid of proof as to the efficacy of the union's rebate procedures.  Section 208 (subd 3, par [b]) of the Civil Service Law neither expressly limits dissenting nonunion employees to an internal union remedy nor purports to shift the burden of justification from the union to plaintiffs; moreover, the burden of justification is a condition precedent to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">use</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, not the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">receipt</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, of plaintiffs' agency shop fees.  That the statutory directive is capable of being administered in an unlawful manner is not sufficient to render it unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Service -- Employee Organizations -- Agency Shop Fee Deduction Refund Procedure -- Constitutionality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiff nonunion employees' contention that section 208 (subd 3, par [b]) of the Civil Service Law is unconstitutional because it requires the union to refund only that portion of plaintiffs' agency shop fees which represent their pro rata share of &quot;expenditures by the organization in aid of activities or causes of a political or ideological&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  nature only incidentally related to terms and conditions of employment&quot;, which phrase omits numerous causes to which nonunion employees may not constitutionally be compelled to contribute, is rejected as premature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Service -- Employee Organizations -- Agency Shop Fee Deduction Refund Procedure -- Constitutionality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Plaintiff nonunion employees' contention that section 208 (subd 3, par [b]) of the Civil Service Law unconstitutionally permits the defendant union to require plaintiffs to register their objections annually with the union through a cumbersome and costly union-operated procedure, is rejected.  The statute requires neither repeated objections nor that the agency shop fee deduction refund procedure it mandates be administered by the union; moreover, even if the statute were construed to permit the union to administer its refund procedure, this alone would not be a constitutional infirmity. </SPAN></P>

The court determined that &sect;184 did not tax plaintiffs on gross receipts not having a nexus with the State of New York.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The backyard of two apartment buildings and a deserted loading dock in the area in back of a closed supermarket are &quot;public places&quot; for purposes of the harassment statute, for which a &quot;public place&quot; is defined as a &quot;place to which the public * * * has access and includes, but is not limited to * * * hallways, lobbies and other portions of apartment houses * * * not constituting rooms or apartments designed for actual residence&quot; (Penal Law, &sect; 240.00, subd 1), since the backyard of an apartment building constitutes an &quot;other portion * * * of an apartment house&quot; within the meaning of the statute and the loading dock is an area to which the public has access; in view of the heavy presumption of constitutionality which attaches to all statutes, the definition of &quot;public place&quot; is not unconstitutional insofar as the backyard of an owner-occupied one- or two-family dwelling would not be deemed a &quot;public place&quot;; accordingly, defendants were properly convicted of harassment for using abusive and obscene language to police officers in the above-described &quot;public places&quot; (Penal Law, &sect; 240.25, subd&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2), since verbally abusive conduct by individuals against police officers is prosecutable as harassment inasmuch as a police officer is &quot;another person&quot; and there is thus no justification for creating a judicially imposed exception or defense to the statute when the complainant is a police officer. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to suppress cocaine and marihuana seized from his person by the police incident to his arrest for possession of a &quot;billy&quot; in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 265.01(1). Defendant argued that the item at issue was not a &quot;billy&quot; under &sect; 265.01(1) and that &sect; 265.01(1) was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a passenger in an automobile stopped by a trooper for speeding. While checking the driver's registration and operator's license, the trooper saw a stick 24 to 30 inches in length, taped on both ends, located on the floor of the car. He identified the instrument as a &quot;billy,&quot; the possession of which was prohibited by &sect; 265.01(1), and arrested the vehicle's occupants for possession of the billy. The drugs found on defendant were incident to that arrest. On appeal, defendant argued that the search was illegal because the arrest was illegal in that the stick was not a &quot;billy&quot; under &sect; 265.01(1). The court held that the instrument was a &quot;billy.&quot; A broomhandle had been sawed-off and taped at both ends. It looked identical to the billy clubs carried by police. When defendant was asked about the weapon, he said it was a &quot;billy.&quot; The determinative factor controlling the classification of the stick as a &quot;billy&quot; was the purpose for which it was designed, which was as a weapon. The transformation of the broomhandle to look like and serve the purpose of a &quot;billy&quot; made it a &quot;billy&quot; under &sect; 265.01(1). The term &quot;billy&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, a passenger in a vehicle stopped by a State trooper for speeding, was properly arrested for criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree pursuant to subdivision (1) of section 265.01 of the Penal Law when the trooper spied a &quot;stick&quot; 24 to 30 inches in length, taped at both ends, on the floor of the car between the front seat and door while he was seeking to check the driver's license and registration; the &quot;stick&quot;, a broomhandle adapted to serve solely as a weapon, using a design which was the same in all material respects as a manufactured policeman's club, is a &quot;billy&quot; within the meaning of the statute.  Accordingly, since the trooper had probable cause for stopping the vehicle and probable cause for believing that the instrument he observed was a prohibited &quot;billy&quot;, he had probable cause for the arrest of defendant, and defendant's motion to suppress cocaine and marihuana seized from his person as an incident to said lawful arrest is denied.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating the Martin Act, N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 352-c, for insider trading. Defendant moved to dismiss on the grounds that the Act did not apply to insider trading and that it was unconstitutional. In particular, defendant contended that the Act was limited to those transactions where privity existed between the buyer and seller and that its application beyond that scope was unconstitutional for vagueness. As to clarity, the court held that there was nothing unclear or ambiguous in the language of the Act. The terms employed by the Act had an accepted meaning long recognized in law and life and could not be held to be so vague and indefinite as to afford defendant insufficient notice of what was prohibited. In light of the Act's legislative history, the court found that there was no sufficient basis upon which to limit the Act's application to transactions where privity exists.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The antifraud provisions of the Martin Act (General Business Law, art 23A) apply to insider trading; moreover, criminal prosecution to punish frauds perpetrated on the general public under section 352-c of the General Business Law is proper.  Accordingly, defendant, an attorney and member of a law firm representing issuers of securities in takeovers and mergers, can be prosecuted by the Attorney-General for acting on secret, advance information of such transactions by buying &quot;target&quot; company securities on the open market through a broker and, after the transactions were announced, liquidating his position at elevated prices to realize huge profits; section 352-c of the General Business Law is not unconstitutional for vagueness as applied to defendant, who is charged with intentional fraud in violation of a fiduciary obligation owed to his law firm and its clients, nor does such an application of section 352-c burden interstate commerce or offend Federal legislation under the Williams Act (US Code, tit 15, &sect;&sect; 78m, 78n).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant brought an action to recover on a claim bill, N.Y. S.B. S-6883, 1981 N.Y. Laws ch. 608, that awarded claimant the right to seek damages because of the wrongful prosecution and conviction of claimant for first-degree murder. Claimant sought a partial summary judgment as to liability, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3212.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An appellate court had determined that a key witness had testified falsely and that the prosecutor had known of the false testimony, failing to correct the falsehood. The claim bill waived the State's sovereign immunity and conferred jurisdiction on the court to determine damages to claimant. The State conceded liability but stated that the bill was required to be constitutional at its inception. However, the State also claimed that it was the attorney general's duty to defend the action, and thus he chose not to take any position. Therefore, the court found that the State's argument was a nullity and that there was no material issue of fact before the court on the issue of liability. Nowhere in the oral argument or in the answer did the State allege that the statute might be unconstitutional. In fact, the attorney general had recommended that the statute be enacted into law. The court lacked jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality in the first instance. Further, the court had no authority to render a declaratory judgment. The court could not sua sponte declare unconstitutional a claim bill that was duly passed by the legislature and signed by the governor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband argued that the sheriff's sale should be permanently enjoined because he had a vested equitable interest in the residence, the sale would contravene the divorce order prohibiting his wife from transferring her interest in the property, and it would work an unconscionable result upon him and his children. The court rejected these arguments, declared that the husband had no interest in the property, dismissed the petition, and vacated the stay of the sheriff's sale. The court held that the sheriff's sale would not violate the divorce order because it only precluded the wife's voluntary conveyance of the property and it did not restrain her judgment creditors. The court also held that the husband had no vested interest in the property because the wife acquired her interest free and clear of his control when he placed it in her name. The court also held that the sale would not harm the husband and his children. The court held that the bank was entitled to recoup the money the husband borrowed but failed to repay and that there was no showing that the husband or the wife would be unable to meet their child support obligations from income or other assets.</SPAN></P>

The court treated the action as one for summary judgment and determined that the election had to fail because the voter qualification was improper as was the disparity in notice.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The building owner obtained an alteration permit to convert a hotel on Manhattan's upper west side into a class A multiple dwelling, but the city revoked the permit two weeks later without giving the building owner notice or an opportunity to be heard based on political pressure from the mayor's office. The building owner filed suit to challenge the revocation and the city counterclaimed for injunctive relief to abate the harassment of tenants. The court granted relief to both parties. The court found that the city's revocation of the permit was arbitrary and contrary to law and an abuse of discretion because the stated reasons were vague and conclusory, because the building owner's supposed failure to file rent control documentation was no failure at all, since none was necessary in light of the entire premises being subject to rent stabilization, not rent control, because there was no evidence that the projected cost was underestimated, and because the summary disposition without notice or a hearing violated due process. The court also granted injunctive relief to the city on its tenant harassment claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord filed a complaint for a permanent injunction and punitive damages against defendants, tenants and tenant association, to enjoin them from collecting and holding the tenants' rent during a rent strike and displaying rent strike signs on apartments inside and outside the building. The landlord filed an order to show cause that contained a temporary restraining order to prohibit the actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As to the collection of rent by the tenant association, the court found that the landlord failed to show a probability of success on the merits. The landlord failed to demonstrate any irreparable injury resulting from denial of the preliminary injunction. The court found that the equities favored the tenant association because of the burden on their First Amendment rights of association which would have resulted from an injunction and the undermining of their ability to organize effectively as protected by the legislature, under N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 230 (1975). As to the rent strike signs, the court found that the tenants sought to engage in a virtually pure form of speech. They wanted to inform other tenants of the rent strike and communicate to the community at large the deprivation of their right to decent housing conditions, to force the landlord to accord them those rights. The court found that the First Amendment protections extended to the signs in the windows and on the apartment doors, which were private areas used by the tenants. The court found that the protection did not extend to hanging banners out of the building's windows that involved public areas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dissolved the temporary restraining order staying the tenant association from continuing solicitation and collection of rents from individual tenants, and from releasing any rent moneys already on deposit. The court denied the landlord's motion for a preliminary injunction on the collection of rents by the tenants association. The court enjoined the tenants from displaying rent strike signs on areas outside the building.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner landlord may not enjoin a tenants' association from soliciting additional members and collecting and holding the rent moneys of its members during a rent strike organized to protest conditions in the building since the tenants' association acted legally in holding rent moneys that the individual tenants would have a right to withhold because of the landlord's violation of the warranty of habitability (Real Property Law, &sect; 235-b) and any attempt to deny the tenants' association the right to solicit members for such lawful activity would undermine the tenants' statutory right to form, join or participate in tenants' groups (Real Property Law, &sect; 230) and would place an undue burden on First Amendment rights of association; in addition, petitioner may not enjoin the members of the tenants' association from displaying &quot;Rent Strike&quot; signs in the windows and on the doors of their apartments since the tenants' right to air grievances and to demand that legally created rights be accorded constitutes speech which is protected from prior restraint by the First Amendment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  notwithstanding its economically coercive effect; the tenants' constitutional rights of association and free speech in regards to such &quot;public&quot; areas of the building outweigh the landlord's already circumscribed private property rights but the draping or hanging of signs or banners out of windows over the building's facade must be prohibited pursuant to a prior appellate decision (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Alcoa Residences v Association of Tenants of Lincoln Towers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 28 AD2d 831). </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the mother was afforded an adequate opportunity to establish paternity and seek support. The court found that the mother was not provided with a sufficient opportunity to bring a paternity proceeding on behalf of her child. The court determined that her attempt to file a petition was frustrated by the inadequacy of the court's procedure made available to her by the state. The court ruled that the state's inadequacy did not bar the mother and her child from seeking financial support from the child's alleged father. Accordingly, in consideration of the best interests of the child, the court held that the mother's petition related back to that date when the mother first appeared at the court's department to commence the proceeding. The court further ruled that the N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 532 stated that the HLA test was available as a matter of right to both parties and that the result of the HLA test, based upon a proper certification the report alone, was admissible as evidence of the probability of paternity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner tenants sought review and annulment of a determination of respondent, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD), by which rentals in tax foreclosed properties were increased by 50 to 108 percent per month. Petitioners were tenants in these properties when their private landlords defaulted in property tax payments and respondent, the City of New York, took over. The court granted the petition to the extent of annulling respondents' determination of rent increases. Tenants of in rem housing had a property interest in their own apartment units sufficient to trigger the rights and protections afforded by both the state Constitution and the New York City Charter. The city and its agencies, while acting as a landlord, did not have unlimited discretion to raise the rents. Respondents' actions in formulating massive rent increases for in rem tenants without published rules, regulations, standards or guidelines, without proper and lawful notice, and without fair and adequate opportunity for tenant consultation, explanation and contravention, were arbitrary, unlawful, unreasonable and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the petition to the extent of annulling respondents' determination by which petitioners' rental charges were increased, of staying respondents from collecting such rent raises, and of declaring respondents' procedures for determining rent increases for in rem tenants administratively unlawful and state constitutionally infirm.
