<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent members of the state tax commission refused to direct the payment of interest on the refund of the mortgage taxes required in an earlier proceeding. The special term held that petitioner taxpayers had no right to interest absent a provision therefor in the mortgage tax refund statute. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York) affirmed on a procedural ground, and the taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an earlier proceeding, it was determined that the mortgage taxes were erroneously imposed on a supplemental mortgage that was entitled to an exemption under N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 263. The court affirmed. The court discussed the rule that interest was required where the tax imposed was void and had no support except an unconstitutional statute. The court held that this rule did not apply to taxes erroneously collected under an otherwise valid statute. In such cases, there could have been many countervailing circumstances for the erroneous collection and payment, not always the responsibility of the tax collector. Thus, the court held that where the tax was erroneously imposed under a valid statute, interest was only authorized if explicitly provided for by statute. Because &sect; 263 was silent on whether interest should or could be paid on tax refunds, interest was not authorized in this case. The court did not reach the procedural issue addressed by the lower court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant warden challenged a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which reversed the trial court's judgment dismissing a writ of habeas corpus brought by respondent relator and granted the application to the extent that bail was fixed in the amount of $ 125,000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator sought a writ of habeas corpus. The trial court dismissed the writ, and relator appealed. The appellate court reversed and granted the application to the extent that bail was fixed in the amount of $ 125,000, and the warden appealed. The court held that the appellate court did not err in fixing bail instead of upholding the denial of bail. The critical support for the denial of bail was the danger to potential witnesses. Considering the conspiratorial nature of the alleged crime and its perpetrators, it was not rational to believe that the witnesses would be safer if the 60-year old relator, long-time resident in his community, and a grandfather, steadily employed, were kept in prison. The court held that in consideration of the fact that relator was in a position to put up high bail and of the nature of the crimes, relator's background, and of other information, the appellate court did not err in fixing the amount of bail at $ 125,000. The judgment of the appellate court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bail -- denial of bail -- in habeas corpus proceeding, court may review denial of bail by criminal court if constitutional standards inhibiting excessive bail or arbitrary denial of bail are violated; here, Appellate Division properly exercised discretion in habeas corpus to admit relator to bail in sum of $ 125,000 on finding that reasons for denial of bail were inadequate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a habeas corpus proceeding, the court may review the action of the criminal court at nisi prius in denying bail or fixing the amount of bail if it appears that the constitutional or statutory standards inhibiting excessive bail or the arbitrary refusal of bail are violated.  The nisi prius criminal court (County Court) here denied bail to relator, held on an indictment for robbery, kidnapping and other related crimes arising out of a serious and involved offense, the court stating that it was taking into consideration the danger of defendant's flight. Special Term, in denying the writ, took into consideration the danger to potential witnesses.  Since it is not rational to believe that witnesses would be safer if this 60-year-old relator, a grandfather steadily employed, were kept in prison, the Appellate Division properly fixed bail, although because of other elements in the case and in the exercise of discretion, in the amount of $ 125,000.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted in separate cases of unauthorized use of a vehicle in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 165.05(1). The Appellate Term of the Supreme Court for the Second and Eleventh Judicial District in the Second Judicial Department (New York) reversed, and the state sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each defendant was found in vehicles which had been taken and moved without the owners' permission. One defendant was found in the rear seat with the engine off, and the other defendant was found asleep in the passenger seat with the motor running. The state claimed that defendants' conduct constituted unauthorized use of a vehicle as there was a presumption one who used a vehicle without the owner's consent knew he did not have consent. Under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 165.05 a person was guilty of unauthorized use of a vehicle if knowing he did not have consent of the owner took operated, exercised control over, rode in or otherwise used a vehicle. Defendants alleged that &sect; 165.05 should have been narrowly construed and only referred to vehicles in motion. The court reversed and remanded for new trials finding there was a fair, natural, and rational connection between the fact that the cars were used without the owners' permission and the presumption that those in a car were aware they did not have permission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's decision that reversed defendants' convictions and remanded the cases for new trials.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Convictions of defendants for class A misdemeanor of unauthorized use of a vehicle (Penal Law, &sect; 165.05, subd. 1) were improperly reversed on the law.  New trials are ordered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New York City, N.Y., Local Law 41 (1967) provided that only in the case of property sold after a certain date could the purchase price paid be used in determining the net return therefrom. The owner's properties did not qualify. On appeal, the court held that (1) the dissent's position was virtually identical to one rejected in previous precedent, and in response to its contention that the use of special equalization ratios was somehow inconsistent with the use of property's assessed value to determine a fair return, it sufficed to point out that the equalization ratio, a borough-wide average, did not purport to measure or reflect the value of any particular property; (2) the court could not conclude, merely on the basis of the special equalization ratio, that one owner's property was actually worth its equalized assessed value or that its return would only amount to 4.7 percent; and (3) although the special equalization allowed the city to impose a higher tax rate than was otherwise constitutionally permissible, real estate taxes were part of the operating expenses of a building, passed directly on to tenants under New York City, N.Y., Admin.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for unlawful loitering, contending that his guilt was not established beyond a reasonable doubt and that the statute he was convicted of violating was unconstitutional because it penalized noncriminal behavior. The court rejected both arguments, and affirmed defendant's conviction. Defendant, a known narcotics addict, was charged with having loitered for the purpose of using or possessing narcotics after he was seen holding, and then dropping upon police arrival, a bottlecap containing a liquid while seated inside a building's stairwell. The court held that this evidence was sufficient to permit the inference that defendant's purpose in loitering was to use narcotics, irrespective of what was actually inside the bottle cap.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment upholding defendant's conviction was affirmed.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- loitering for purpose of using narcotic drug -- defendant's conviction of loitering for purpose of possessing or using narcotic drug in violation of subdivision 5 of section 1533 of former Penal Law was properly affirmed -- unnecessary for People to prove that liquid spilled by defendant when he saw police officer was heroin -- prosecutor's consent to dismissal of charges against defendant's companion who had empty glassine envelopes does not require that possession of drug be proven -- circumstances of gathering, possession of narcotic implements by defendant's companion and expert testimony of police officer as to use of &quot;cookers&quot; by addicts support</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> inference that defendant and companions had gathered to take narcotic drugs -- subdivision 5 of section 1533 of former Penal Law is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was convicted of loitering for the purpose of possessing or using a narcotic drug in violation of subdivision 5 of section 1533 of the former Penal Law. An officer came upon defendant and two others on a stair landing in a building.  Defendant had a bottle cap containing a liquid in his hand and one of the others had a hypodermic needle and an eyedropper. A third had glassine envelopes which were empty. When defendant saw the officer he dropped the bottle cap, spilling the liquid, none of which was recovered.  The officer testified that bottle caps are used as &quot;cookers&quot; in which heroin and water are mixed, and the mixture is then drawn up into an eyedropper and injected into the vein by means of a hypodermic needle.

While the People were unable to actually prove that the liquid in the &quot;cooker&quot; was a narcotic drug, the circumstances of the gathering, the possession of narcotic implements by one of defendant's companions and the expert testimony of the police officer as to the use of &quot;cookers&quot; by narcotic addicts support the inference that defendant and his companions had gathered to take narcotic drugs.  While the evidence is circumstantial, the facts support no other inference but guilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Subdivision 5 of section 1533 of the former Penal Law provides that a person who &quot;loiters about any stairway * * * or any passageway of a building for the purpose of unlawfully using or possessing any narcotic drug&quot; is guilty of a misdemeanor. The statute is not unconstitutionally vague and is a reasonable restriction upon the individual for the public good. The statute sought to prevent idle persons engaged in the unlawful traffic in narcotics from gathering together for that purpose in places frequented by other citizens, thereby endangering public health, morals and tranquility.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board was order to devise a plan the would satisfy the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause and to submit the plan to the voters of the county for their approval. Pursuant to that order, three plans were devised and submitted to the voters but were rejected at the polls. A taxpayer then filed an action to compel the board to reapportion in accordance with constitutional requirements. The board submitted a plan, but that plan was rejected at Special Term. The board then submitted another plan, that the lower court approved. The taxpayer appealed and the court affirmed. The court found that the population variance contained in the plan was within permissible limits and the practical and historical justification for the variance was sufficient because the plan did not ignore population equality, but achieved substantial equality within the context of a long established town government framework, thus accommodating both constitutional and practical considerations. Also, the court held that the plan was constitutional because the taxpayer failed to show that the plan's multimember districts constituted an invidious discrimination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A plan of apportionment of a county provides for a County Legislature composed, on the basis of population, of 18 members chosen from 5 districts which correspond to the county's 5 constituent towns.  The smallest district receives one representative.  The population of the 4 remaining districts is divided by that of the smallest district and receives the number of representatives equal to the whole number resulting from the division plus any major fraction. There is a variation of 12% in the number of people per legislator.  Deviations from strict population equality may be broader in scope when dealing with local, intra-State legislative bodies. Accordingly the population variance here is within permissible limits in view of the objective of retaining the outlines of the long-established town government.  The plan represents a balanced, bona fide application of the &quot;one man-one vote&quot; principle to the needs and circumstances of local government and is not unconstitutionally defective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The largest district has 6 representatives while the smallest has one.  Since each voter in the largest district votes for 6 representatives to represent his interests, his vote is equal in weight to that of any other citizen in the county.  No showing has been made that the plan operates to minimize or cancel out the voting strength of a racial or political element of the voting population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The plan provided that a person elected to the office of Town Supervisor would automatically be entitled to a seat in the County Legislature.  Special Term properly modified this provision so as to require that, if a Town Supervisor also wished to be a County Legislator, he must be elected separately. Section 10 of the Municipal Home Rule Law provides that &quot;a plan of apportionment adopted by a County * * * may provide that * * * supervisors of towns * * * shall be eligible to be elected as members of the county legislative body&quot;.  The use of the term &quot;elected&quot; indicates a legislative intent that a Town Supervisor could serve as a County Legislator only if he prevailed in an election for the office of County Legislator.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of assault in the second degree and of impairing the morals of a minor. The crimes were committed on petitioner's 11-year-old daughter. The assault as a felony depended upon an intent to commit a crime, incest. The lower court denied petitioner's application for habeas corpus relief. On appeal, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction for assault and for impairing the morals of a minor. However, the court found that there was a jurisdictional defect in that the assault charge should have been tried in the Family Court. The court explained that the Family Court had exclusive original jurisdiction over any proceeding concerning acts that would constitute an assault between a parent and a child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed petitioner's conviction for assault and remanded the case for a new trial.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Family Court -- assault -- Family Court had exclusive original jurisdiction over assault as felony which depended on intent to commit incest -- Family Court did not have exclusive original jurisdiction of charge of endangering morals of minor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant was convicted in the County Court both of assault and of impairing the morals of a minor.  The assault as a felony depended on an intent to commit a crime -- incest. The Family Court &quot;has exclusive original jurisdiction&quot; over &quot;any proceeding&quot; concerning &quot;acts which would constitute * * * an assault * * * between parent and child&quot; (Family Ct.  Act, &sect; 812; cf. N. Y. Const., art. VI, &sect; 13, subd. b).  If there is to be a prosecution for an assault within the enumerated family group of any degree or for any purpose, the prosecution must begin in the Family Court.  The judgment of conviction for assault should be reversed and that charge should be transferred to the Family Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since the offense of endangering the morals of a minor does not itself come within the statutory definition of either assault or disorderly conduct and was essentially a different crime from either, the Family Court did not have exclusive original jurisdiction of that charge.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant brought a motion to suppress the evidence, which the trial court denied. Defendant was convicted for possession of narcotics.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was improperly convicted of illegal possession of narcotics.

The police officer had neither an arrest nor search warrant for the defendant, and the burglary case was apparently dismissed for lack of evidence. The evidence should have been suppressed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y.

The court reversed the decisions of the lower courts and held that Rule 3216 constituted a valid exercise of the legislative power.The court found that the procedural device of dismissing complaints or actions for undue delay was a legislative creation and not, as was urged, a product of the court's inherent power.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  CPLR 3216 provides that a defendant, before moving to dismiss the complaint for failure or neglect to prosecute the action, must serve upon the plaintiff &quot;a written demand * * * requiring [him] * * * to serve and file a note of issue within forty-five days after receipt of such demand.&quot; The opportunity which the statute affords to correct a procedural default presents no significant constitutional issue.  There is no language in the State Constitution which limits the legislative power to act in this area.  On the contrary, section 30 of article VI of the Constitution explicitly grants the Legislature broad power to formulate rules of procedure, restricting the courts to &quot;the adoption of regulations * * * consistent with the general practice and procedure as provided by statute or general rules.&quot; It does limit the Legislature's power to that which it &quot;has heretofore exercised&quot;.  Nevertheless, the language of the Constitution leaves little room for doubt that the power to make rules of procedure lies principally with the Legislature and not with the courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The particular procedure involved is not such a fundamental part of a court's inherent power that it is beyond the competence of the Legislature to limit or circumscribe its availability.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. To hold CPLR 3216 invalid because it interferes with court calendars would throw into jeopardy numerous other provisions of the broad and comprehensive procedural scheme which constitutes the CPLR.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appeals were filed in three separate criminal prosecutions that took place in three separate trial courts (New York), wherein a determination concerning the retroactive applicability of new case law precedent, which related to the disposition of addiction hearings, was sought.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In each of the three cases, defendants were convicted upon their plea of guilty to a drug possession violation and a hearing, pursuant to N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 208, was held before a judge sitting without a jury. In each case, defendant was certified an addict and committed to the custody of the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission. The issue on appeal was whether new case law precedent, which declared that it was a constitutional equal protection violation to deny such defendants an opportunity for a jury trial in criminal narcotics commitment cases, when such opportunity was afforded in civil narcotic commitment cases, applied retroactively? The People argued that the hearings at issue were fairly conducted; that retroactive application of the relevant case law would have imposed severe additional burdens on the courts; and, that law enforcement officials and courts had relied upon a statute which was presumptively constitutional. None of those arguments, however, was sufficient to overcome the considerations militating towards the retroactive application of the applicable case. The court therefore gave the case retroactive effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments in the first and second action were affirmed. The judgment in the third action was reversed and the matter was remitted to the appropriate trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the decedents were killed when defendant airline's plane crashed into Lake Michigan within the territorial boundary of the state of Illinois, plaintiffs, decedents' representatives, filed separate wrongful death actions in New York against defendant airline. In two actions, the trial court ruled against defendant's motion for summary judgment in order to dismiss all claims in excess of the $ 30,000 limitation imposed by the Illinois wrongful death statute. In the other two actions, plaintiffs' motion to dismiss the affirmative defenses alleging the same limitation was granted. The appellate court considered plaintiffs' appeals together, reversed the denial of defendant's motions, and granted partial summary judgment dismissing all claims in excess of $ 30,000. The appellate court certified questions for review. The court held that actions for wrongful death, whether or not they were classified as a maritime tort, were not restricted by the Illinois $ 30,000 limitation. The court held that the location of the accident was not the sole factor for applying the wrongful death statute of a particular state and that Illinois did not govern these actions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's judgment in favor of defendant airline and answered certified questions in the negative.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs' decedents were killed when defendant's airplane which was on a regularly scheduled nonstop commercial flight originating at New York and terminating in Chicago, Illinois, crashed into Lake Michigan, within the territorial boundary of the State of Illinois.  One of the passengers resided in New Jersey, and was employed by a New York concern and worked in New York.  Another lived in Connecticut and commuted each day to his place of employment in New York.  Two others were resident of Iowa and were returning home from New York.  The appeals were taken on certified questions, limiting the court to a determination of whether the Appellate Division properly concluded that the Illinois wrongful death statute, with its $ 30,000 limitation, is applicable to each of these actions.  An examination of Federal law, the law of this State, and the law of Illinois requires the conclusion that the Appellate Division was in error in determining that the law of Illinois applies to these four actions.  </SPAN></P>

A regulation of the Department of Licenses prohibiting a licensed broker from consigning or selling tickets to an &quot;unlicensed person&quot; for resale has the effect of proscribing the sale of tickets to any ticket broker or agency located in any place outside of New York City.  This exercise of power exceeds the authority delegated to the Commissioner of Licenses to make rules and regulations &quot;as may be deemed necessary for the protection of the public&quot; (General Business Law, &sect; 169-b) against &quot;fraud, extortion, exorbitant rates and similar abuses&quot; (General Business Law, &sect; 167).  A statute, the sole object of which is to assure that licensed ticket brokers do not resell tickets at amounts in excess of a specified price, does not authorize a city official to completely prohibit trade in such tickets with agencies located outside the City of New York.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, who had previously been convicted of assaulting a witness, were granted immunity to testify before a grand jury which was investigating a conspiracy to intimidate witnesses who were to testify at a probe of violations of law. They answered all of the questions and admitted that they had been hired to commit the assault. However, they denied that they knew who their principals were. Four days after defendants testified, the policeman who arrested them was called before the same grand jury. The policeman testified that defendants had attempted to bribe him not to be a witness against them and to get rid of the evidence. Defendants were then indicted for bribery and convicted, on their pleas of guilty, of attempted bribery. On appeal, the lower court affirmed the convictions. The court affirmed the judgment by holding that defendants' Fifth Amendment rights were not violated by their bribery indictments, pursuant to the former Penal Law &sect; 2447, because whatever evidence might have been revealed by their grand jury testimony was wholly insubstantial, in that the indictments were the result of the policeman's testimony based on his personal knowledge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, which affirmed the trial court's judgment that convicted defendants, upon their pleas of guilty, of attempted bribery as a felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- attempted bribery -- defendants properly convicted on pleas of guilty of attempted bribery -- immunity granted before Grand Jury did not encompass crime here charged -- section 2447 of former Penal Law bars only use of witness' testimony and any evidence derived therefrom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendants, called before a Grand Jury investigating a conspiracy to intimidate witnesses who were to testify at a probe of violations of law involving public contracts, were granted immunity. They answered all questions and admitted they had been hired to commit an assault, but denied that they knew who their principals were.  The policeman who had arrested defendants later testified to the same Grand Jury that defendants had tried to bribe him.  Defendants were properly convicted on their pleas of guilty of attempted robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The immunity granted before the Grand Jury did not encompass the crime charged in the present indictment. The police officer's testimony was in no way derived from anything said by defendants' to the Grand Jury and it established a prima facie case of bribery. The indictment was, therefore, based on sufficient and untainted evidence.  Even if it be assumed that defendants' testimony was related to the bribery, the indictment was not the product of that testimony.  Section 2447 of the former Penal Law bars only the use of the witness' testimony and any evidence derived therefrom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It is immaterial whether or not defendants were the &quot;targets&quot; of this investigation.  Although a defendant here did not assert his privilege against self incrimination, he was granted immunity before he could.  This action of the Grand Jury could not operate to deny this defendant complete protection from any use of his testimony against him.  His testimony could not furnish the basis for a finding of an indictment, and the record demonstrates that it did not.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city and intervenor town challenged a judgment from the Supreme Court at Special Term, New York County (New York), which had ruled that authorization to build bridges was in contravention of the state constitutional requirement that the public corporation authorized to do so must have been created by special act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature had amended the Public Authorities Law. Among other things, it created the Metropolitan Transportation Authority or continued a previously created authority under this name, N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 83. Appellant city and intervenor town sued the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for declaratory judgment, contending that ch. 717 of N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 96 was unconstitutional because it did not conform to the mandate of N.Y. Const. art. X, &sect; 5, which provided that no public corporation having authority to contract indebtedness and to collect fees and charges shall have been created except by special act of the legislature. The trial court found for respondents, city and town, on the ground that the authorization to build bridges was in contravention of the constitutional requirement that the public corporation authorized to do so must have been created by special act. The court reversed, and held that it was manifest that appellant Metropolitan Transportation Authority was created by special act and that the implementation of its powers, including the right to build bridges, was a valid exercise of legislative authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment from the trial court, which had ruled that the public corporation authorized to build bridges must have been created by special act, because the legislature had legal authority to implement the powers of its transportation authority to build bridges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public authorities -- general or special act -- chapter 717 of Laws of 1967 which created Metropolitan Transportation Authority not in conflict with article X (&sect; 5) of New York Constitution requiring creation of public corporation by special act -- Authority was created by special act within intention of constitutional provision -- additional asserted grounds of constitutional invalidity properly before court although not passed on at Special Term -- no separate causes of action -- act was not local bill (N. Y. Const., art. III, &sect; 15) nor law in relation to property, affairs or government of town</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> (N. Y. Const., art. IX, &sect; 2, subd. [b], par. [2].)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Chapter 717 of the Laws of 1967 which created the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is not in conflict with the provisions of section 5 of article X of the New York Constitution which provides that no public corporation having authority to contract indebtedness and to collect fees and charges shall be created except by special act of the Legislature, and is not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. What was intended by the constitutional provision was a requirement that the State Legislature itself create public corporations of the type described and that their creation not be left either to administrative officers or to local governments.  The term &quot;special act&quot;, as it is used here, can only mean that a public corporation of this type must be created by a particular enactment of establishment by the Legislature.  It cannot mean that only one subject could be stated in the statute by which the corporation is created; or that in the statute creating the corporation the Legislature could not deal additionally with other matters, including the kinds of powers to be exercised or duties to be performed by the public corporation thus created.  The Legislature created the Metropolitan Transportation Authority by a special act within the intention of section 5 of article X and the incidental power to build a State bridge was relevant to its corporate function and within the frame of legislative power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The court at Special Term did not pass on additional asserted grounds of constitutional invalidity to the 1967 statute, but the additional grounds have been argued by the appellants, by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">amicus curiae</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, by the intervenor town and by the plaintiff city.  These additional objections are properly before the court and they should be determined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The separate &quot;causes of action&quot; based on different constitutional provisions are not different causes of action but different legal and constitutional arguments based on precisely the same factual allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Chapter 717 of the Laws of 1967 is not a &quot;local bill&quot; within section 15 of article III of the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Nor in authorizing a State corporation to build a State bridge or in describing where a State highway is to be located is it a law within article IX (&sect; 2, subd. [b], par. [2]) in relation to the property, affairs or government of the Town of Oyster Bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  The defendants' mistaken concession that the act was not a special act, not repeated in the Court of Appeals, does not bind the court to hold it unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State Liquor Authority (authority) sought review of orders of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First and Fourth Judicial Departments (New York) in three cases consolidated on appeal. In the cases, the appellate court on the basis of evidence seized illegally under U.S. Const. amend. IV annulled the authority's determinations that suspended or cancelled the liquor licenses held by appellee licensees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The authority contended that that the appellate court erred in applying an exclusionary rule to the administrative license proceedings. On appeal, the court held that the appellate court properly annulled the authority's determinations. The court found that the logic of the exclusionary rule for illegal searches and seizures under U.S. Const. amend. IV applied to administrative proceedings. Specifically, the court held that (1) an authority investigator impermissibly searched the pockets of a coat hanging in the rear of a liquor store, discovered credit sales slips and used the slips as evidence to suspend a liquor store license for making unlawful liquor sales on credit, (2) the authority improperly cancelled a hotel liquor license on the basis of evidence of gambling that had been determined by a county court in a criminal proceeding to have been the product of unauthorized wiretaps, and (3) the authority improperly suspended a liquor license on the basis of evidence of betting slips that was suppressed in a criminal proceeding brought against the license holder because the evidence was seized pursuant to an illegal search.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate court's orders in each of the three cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Intoxicating liquors -- licenses -- evidence -- exclusionary rule of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Mapp v. Ohio (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">367 U.S. 643)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> applies to administrative proceedings before State Liquor Authority as well as to criminal prosecutions -- broad grant of statutory authority to State Liquor Authority to conduct searches without warrant would be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- State Liquor Authority's determination suspending liquor license, based on evidence which was product of unlawful search and seizure, properly annulled -- where, with regard to another petitioner,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> County Court had voided eavesdropping order and subsequently issued search warrant, petitioner not required to litigate validity of order and warrant again before State Liquor Authority -- in third proceeding, also, State Liquor Authority may not disregard court determination that evidence was fruit of illegal search and seizure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The exclusionary rule of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Mapp </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Ohio</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (367 U.S. 643) applies to administrative proceedings before the State Liquor Authority as well as to criminal prosecutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Two inspectors from the State Liquor Authority entered a liquor shop and asked the store manager, the only person present, if they could inspect the premises.  When the manager told them to &quot;go ahead,&quot; one of the inspectors went immediately to a room in the rear of the liquor store where a coat was hanging and went through the pockets of the coat and found sales slips indicating that sales had been made on credit.  It is not clear that the Authority has a broad statutory power to make an administrative inspection of the licensed premises, including all items of personal property such as the coat in the rear room.  In any event, such a broad grant of statutory authority to conduct warrantless searches would be unconstitutional.  The investigator's entry into the back room of the store and, particularly, his search of the coat may not be constitutionally justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. No basis exists for disturbing the conclusion reached by the Appellate Division that the questioning of the liquor store's principal, like all of the other items in evidence, was the product of the unlawful search and seizure, and that the Authority's determination, grounded on such evidence, must fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In the case of another licensee, evidence from his home was seized during a search made pursuant to a search warrant obtained after interception of telephone conversations pursuant to an ex parte eavesdropping order. A court thereafter voided the eavesdropping order and the search warrant. Since the search was unlawful per se in the absence of a valid warrant, the evidence obtained as a result of the search was inadmissible for any purpose and the Authority's determination based upon such evidence was, therefore, properly annulled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Similarly, in the case of another licensee, from whose premises evidence was seized during a search which was made incidental to an arrest, the Authority may not disregard a court determinaton, made upon a motion to suppress the use of said evidence in criminal proceedings against the licensee, that the arrest to which the search was incidental was made without probable cause and the evidence must be suppressed. The court's decision is determinative of the issue and, although it is reviewable through the normal appellate process, neither the administrative hearing nor the article 78 proceeding to review it constitutes an appropriate proceeding to pass upon its propriety.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which reversed a judgment dismissing respondent supreme court justice's action to recover that portion of his salary payable from the date of his removal to the date of the filing of the claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent supreme court justice brought an action to recover that portion of his salary payable by the state from the date of his removal to the date of the filing of the claim. The lower court granted the state's motion to dismiss the claim, and respondent appealed. The appellate court reversed, and the state appealed. The court held that the doctrine of res judicata did not estop respondent from collaterally attacking the subject matter jurisdiction of the Court on the Judiciary because there was no available means of appeal to review that question and because the determination as to its jurisdiction was a mere legal conclusion, not based upon any litigated fact. The court held that the claim failed to state a cause of action because respondent's removal was valid. The order appealed from was reversed and the order and judgment of the lower court dismissing the complaint was reinstated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's order and reinstated the lower court's order dismissing respondent supreme court justice's claim to recover that portion of his salary payable by the state from the date of his removal to the date of the filing of the claim, holding that the judgment of the Court on the Judiciary was not res judicata, and that the claim did not state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- removal -- legal conclusion of Court</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> on Judiciary that it had jurisdiction of proceedings to remove claimant as Justice of Supreme Court, since constitutional provision under which claimant was removed provided no right of appeal, is subject to collateral attack in claim by Justice for unpaid salary from date of his removal; Court of Claims had jurisdiction of subject matter -- on direct appeal to Supreme Court of United States, that court's dismissal for want of substantial Federal question is equivalent to affirmance on merits; accordingly, removal was valid and claim fails to state cause of action -- assuming that Supreme Court's decision is not res judicata, procedural defects on which claimant attacks his removal do not reach jurisdictional dimensions -- phrase &quot;for cause&quot; in constitutional provision providing for removal is not vague and means legal cause -- Court on Judiciary was not at once complainant, prosecutor and judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Claimant, an elected Justice of the Supreme Court, was removed from his office by the Court on the Judiciary.  By this claim, claimant seeks to recover that portion of his salary payable by the State from the date of his removal to the date of filing the claim, alleging that he was never legally removed from office.  Since no appeal from the Court on the Judiciary is provided by section 9-a (now &sect; 22) of article VI of the State Constitution, under which claimant was removed, the determination of the Court on the Judiciary is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  While a court's determination sustaining jurisdiction against attack is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a collateral action, it is not where a court's determination as to subject-matter jurisdiction is a legal conclusion. Accordingly, claimant is not prevented from asserting the instant claim, and the Court of Claims had jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Claimant took a direct appeal from the Court on the Judiciary to the United States Supreme Court.  That appeal was dismissed for want of a substantial Federal question.  Such dismissal is equivalent of an affirmance on the merits insofar as Federal constitutional questions are involved.  Accordingly, claimant's removal was valid and having had a final determination on the merits claimant is estopped from again litigating them and this claim fails to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Assuming that the Supreme Court's dismissal is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the procedural defects on which claimant attacks his removal do not reach jurisdictional dimensions and in no way deprived him of a fair trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. That the term &quot;for cause&quot; is not defined by the constitutional provision authorizing the removal of a Judge does not render it void for vagueness. The phrase &quot;for cause&quot; means &quot;legal cause&quot; affecting or concerning the ability or fitness of the incumbent to perform the duty imposed upon him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The functions of complainant, prosecutor and judge were not combined in the Court on the Judiciary in violation of claimant's constitutional rights.  The Court on the Judiciary was not the accuser, for it was the report of a Supreme Court Justice which served as the complaint.  Such court had no interest in the outcome of the case because it reviewed the allegations to determine whether basis existed for preferral of charges.  The final charges were preferred by counsel designated by the court.  It cannot be assumed that, because the court designated the attorneys, it became so intimately involved with the case as to deprive claimant of an impartial tribunal.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the only incident during the trial on which there was disagreement by members of the court as to whether its occurrence required a new trial was the anonymous communications by telephone with several of the jurors following the close of the People's case and before submission of the defense.

The questioning and admonition of the jurors cured the possible harm under the accepted precedents because it served a real purpose in drawing their attention to the unfairness of their considering anything but the record evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state trooper witnessed defendant walking in the early morning hours and asked him certain questions regarding defendant's identity and his destination. Defendant refused to answer the trooper's questions and was subsequently convicted of loitering in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.35(6). On appeal, the lower appellate court affirmed. On further appeal, the court reversed the conviction and ordered the information dismissed. The court held the information did not state that the trooper was justified in suspecting defendant might have been engaged or was about to engage in crime as was required by &sect; 240.35(6). The court stated the trooper's testimony that defendant was walking in an area in which there had been frequent burglaries was insufficient to establish a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the lower appellate court, which affirmed defendant's conviction for loitering. The court ordered the information dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- loitering -- defendant improperly convicted of violation of section 240.35 (subd. 6) of Penal Law -- information failed to refer to provision of section allegedly violated which states that loitering, remaining or wandering must be under circumstances which &quot;justify suspicion that he may be engaged or about to engage in crime&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a State trooper observed defendant walking along a highway in the early morning hours, the trooper stopped his vehicle and asked the man to come over to the car and tell him where he was going, where he was coming from and his identity and where he resided.  The man replied that he did not think he had to answer the questions.  The trooper informed the man that his refusal to answer the questions could result in his being arrested for loitering and when the man still refused to answer the questions, he was arrested and charged with violation of section 240.35 (subd. 6) of the Penal Law in that he &quot;did remain &amp; wander about in a public place without apparent reason under circumstances which justify suspicion&quot; and that, upon inquiry of a peace officer, he refused to identify himself and failed to give a reasonable credible account of his conduct or purpose.  The subdivision of the statute under which defendant was convicted contains clauses which are conjunctive, rather than disjunctive, and, in order to sustain a conviction under it, each of the conjunctive elements must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The information under which he was tried failed to refer to the terms of the section allegedly violated which states that the loitering, remaining or wandering must be under circumstances which &quot;justify suspicion that he may be engaged or about to engage in crime&quot;.  Defendant's failure to answer the trooper's questions did not constitute a violation of subdivision 6 of section 240.35.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York) which sustained his murder conviction. He claimed that he was deprived of a fair trial by pretrial publicity and by denial of his motion for a change of venue, and that evidence of his sanity at the time of the commission of the crime, found during a N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 658 hearing, was improperly admitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for murder in the first degree. His motion for a change of venue due to pretrial publicity was denied. Upon motion of counsel, he was committed for psychiatric evaluation under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 658. The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the appellate court affirmed. On review, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that the pretrial publicity was not of such a character as to require a change of venue because there was no evidence that newspaper coverage prejudiced his chance for a fair trial, and further, defense counsel did not use all his peremptory challenges and pronounced himself satisfied with the jury. The court further held that procedure employed in the examination of the prosecution's expert witnesses satisfied the requirements of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 4515, and that defendant could not complain that the &sect; 658 psychiatric evaluation violated his right against self-incrimination or to counsel because he himself requested it. Finally, the court affirmed the constitutionality of N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 663 because it did not allow a jury to fall short of the impartiality guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. VI, XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment convicting defendant of murder in the first degree. The court held that the pretrial publicity was not of such a character as to require a change of venue, that procedure employed in the examination of the prosecution's expert witnesses satisfied statutory requirements, and that, having requested a mental examination, defendant could not complain that it violated his right against self-incrimination or to counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- murder in first degree -- on defendant's conviction for murder in first degree, denial of motion for change of venue did not deprive defendant of fair trial -- proof of defendant's sanity not required on direct case -- report of psychiatrists was not received in evidence by &quot;indirection&quot; -- use upon trial of defendant's statements to psychiatrists while mental examination requested by defendant's counsel was going on was not objected to -- by requesting examination, defendant's privilege against self incrimination was not violated -- defense counsel knew that examination would cover defendant's mental condition at time crime was committed -- section 663 of Judiciary Law dealing with jurors who have conscientious scruples against death penalty is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. On defendant's conviction for the crime of murder in the first degree, defendant was not deprived of a fair trial by the denial of his motion for a change of venue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. It was unnecessary for the People to prove on their direct case that defendant was sane. Proof of sanity upon rebuttal was sufficient to establish that fact upon the whole case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There was more than sufficient evidence from which the jury could conclude that defendant was sane and able to premeditate the crime and intend to kill the victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. There is no support for defendant's claim that the report of the psychiatrists was improperly received in evidence by &quot;indirection&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. After he was indicted, defendant, at the request of his counsel, was committed to a State mental hospital for a mental examination under section 658 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  His failure to object to the use upon the trial of his statements to the psychiatrists precludes him from now complaining that his privilege against self incrimination or his right to counsel was thereby violated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Defense counsel, when he requested the mental examination, could not have been unaware that the examination would cover defendant's mental condition at the time of the crime as well.  Defendant may not be permitted to invoke the defense of insanity and foreclose the People from the benefit of a mental examination to meet this issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  Section 663 of the Judiciary Law, which prohibits the selection of a person for a jury in a criminal action who states that he has conscientious scruples against the death penalty which would prevent him from finding a verdict of guilt of any crime punishable by death, is not unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, convicted drug addicts, sought review of decisions of the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court for the Second and Eleventh Judicial Districts in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which failed to give appellants a jury trial on the issue of their addictions pursuant to the Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 208(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, convicted drug addicts, attacked the constitutionality of the provisions of the Mental Hygiene Law (Law) after being denied a jury trial by the lower court. They were ultimately convicted of possession of narcotic instruments under the Law. The court reversed, holding that &sect; 208 (2) of the Law was unconstitutional because it failed to accord a convicted addict a jury trial on the issue of his addiction. The court held that there was no rational basis for denying a jury trial. Appellants' privilege against self incrimination and right to counsel were not violated when evidence was received of admissions of addiction made to examining physicians during the course of court ordered examinations. The court held that the applicability of constitutional rights and privileges was equally suitable for the statements made to a police officer, such as an admission of addiction, and having concluded that the protections of the criminal law were not required here because of the nature of the program, the statement to the police officer was admissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate courts' convictions of appellants, convicted drug addicts, because the section of the Mental Hygiene Law that did not allow appellants' a jury trial on the issue of their addiction violated the Equal Protection Clause and was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Mental health -- drug addiction -- privilege against self incrimination and right to counsel of appellants were not violated when evidence was received, at hearings to determine whether appellants were drug addicts, of admissions of addiction made to examining physician -- addiction may be found on preponderance of evidence -- appellants were </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutionally</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> denied jury trial on issue of their addiction -- physician-patient privilege inapplicable -- defense counsel was improperly prevented from cross-examining People's expert about criteria used to determine addiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Under the Narcotics Control Act of 1966 (Mental Hygiene Law, &sect; 200 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.), appellants' privilege against self incrimination and right to counsel were not violated when evidence was received, at the hearings to determine whether appellants were addicts, of admissions of addiction made to examining physicians during the course of court-ordered examinations and by one appellant made to a police officer upon her arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since the purpose of certification is a rehabilitative one, addiction may be found on a preponderance of evidence rather than beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The requisites of a criminal trial are not applicable to these proceedings.  Appellants are entitled to a jury trial on the issue of their addiction and subdivision 2 of section 208 of the Mental Hygiene Law (providing for a hearing without a jury) violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Because of the rehabilitative purposes of the treatment afforded under the Narcotics Control Act, the physician-patient privilege ( CPLR 4504), which would normally protect medical records and statements made to physicians, is inapplicable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The trial court improperly limited the scope of one attorney's cross-examination of the People's medical expert about the criteria the expert used in reaching his conclusion that his client was an addict. It was proper cross-examination to ask the doctor what his interpretation of addiction was and, in reaching his conclusion, what weight he gave to each criterion.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile sought review of an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which unanimously affirmed an order of the family court adjudging the juvenile to be a juvenile delinquent following a finding of fact made at a hearing that the juvenile had committed an act which, if committed by an adult, would have constituted the crime of larceny.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was adjudicated a delinquent upon facts that he had removed money from a pocketbook and stolen it. The family court held that the finding met the preponderance of the evidence standard, as required under &sect; 744(b) of the New York Family Court Act. The appellate court affirmed, and the court, on appeal under constitutional grounds, affirmed. After a comprehensive overview of the objectives of the juvenile offender system, the court held that the preponderance of the evidence standard was expressly stated in &sect; 744(b) and went a long way toward providing due process safeguards for children in delinquency proceedings in family court. There was no constitutional violation because the delinquency status was not made a crime and the proceedings were not criminal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the appellate court, which, in turn, had affirmed the juvenile's adjudication as a delinquent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Infants -- juvenile delinquency -- sufficiency of proof -- section 744 (subd.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 744 (subd. [b]) of the Family Court Act, which provides that any determination at the conclusion of an adjudicatory hearing that the child did an act &quot;must be based on a preponderance of the evidence&quot;, is not unconstitutional.  In the procedure governing juvenile delinquency it is not necessary that the proof be beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The finding by the Family Court, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, that the allegation against the 12-year-old child to the effect that he had removed $ 112 from a person's pocketbook and stolen it was true was a constitutionally sufficient finding.  There is no deprivation of due process in the statutory provision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Since the proceeding is different from a criminal prosecution, there is no substantial equal protection question in the case.  It is not an absence of procedural due process that a noncriminal status determination have a different measure of proof than that required for conviction of crime.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of a decision of the Supreme Court, New York County, Special Term (New York), which dismissed the State's petition under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 that prohibited enforcement of a trial court's order mandating that a young adult defendant required a jury trial. In another case, defendant sought review of a decision of the Supreme Court, New York County, Appellate Term, which affirmed his conviction for the crime of jostling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For one appeal, the defendant was convicted of jostling, a misdemeanor carrying a maximum term of one-year imprisonment, and the trial court denied the right to a jury trial under New York City, N.Y., Crim. Ct. Act &sect; 40. The court held that those crimes termed as misdemeanors in New York were not characterized as serious and thus those charged with such crimes were not entitled to a Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. The court further found that &sect; 40 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because territorial discrimination was permitted to meet the demands of a large metropolitan area. The other defendant was charged as a young adult with a possibility of receiving a reformatory sentence of up to four years. The court found that &sect; 40 was not unconstitutional, but it held that the trial court had no jurisdiction to impose a reformatory sentence pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law art. 75. However, the trial court was able to prosecute any defendant, including a young adult, for any misdemeanor and was further able to impose an authorized sentence not greater than one year, without a jury. Therefore, the appellate court erred in dismissing the State's petition for prohibition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for the crime of jostling. The court reversed the appellate court's dismissal of the State's petition to prohibit enforcement of the order requiring a jury trial and granted the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- right to trial by jury -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 40 of New York City Criminal Court Act</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> which provides for trial without jury of misdemeanors for which punishment is not more than one year in prison is constitutional -- section does not violate equal protection clause</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> because persons outside City of New York charged with misdemeanors do receive right to trial by jury -- as to defendant charged with misdemeanor who, because he is between ages of 16 and 21, can receive sentence of four-year imprisonment in reformatory, section 40 is constitutional but court lacks jurisdiction to impose reformatory sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A defendant charged with the class A misdemeanor of jostling for which the maximum term of imprisonment is not more than one year is not entitled to a trial by jury as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, and section 40 of the New York City Criminal Court Act, which provides for trial of such misdemeanors without a jury, is not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Nor does section 40 violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because elsewhere in the State defendants charged with identical misdemeanors receive the right of trial by jury.  Such territorial discrimination is proper and, moreover, the caseload in the criminal courts of the highly populated City of New York requires the distinction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. With respect to respondent in the above-entitled proceeding, who is charged with a misdemeanor and a violation but who, because he is between the ages of 16 and 21 and thus subject to treatment under article 75 of the Penal Law, can receive a four-year term in a reformatory, section 40 is constitutional but the New York City Criminal Court lacks jurisdiction to impose a reformatory sentence on young adults, in the absence of legislation authorizing a jury trial in such cases and providing procedural machinery therefor.  Accordingly, since respondent is still awaiting trial and cannot receive a reformatory sentence, he is not entitled to a trial by jury.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grand jury was investigating possible drug abuse on the university campus and the subpoenaed faculty members were targets of that inquiry. The faculty members sought further review after the lower court affirmed the initial denial of their motion to quash the subpoenas. The court affirmed the denial, holding that the protections of U.S. Const. amend. V did not extend to the situation at bar. The court concluded that the fact that the faculty members were prospective defendants was not a reason to excuse them from being compelled to appear before the grand jury. Further, the court determined that the proposed questions concerning advocacy of drug use did not violate the faculty members' U.S. Const. amend. I right of academic freedom and, accordingly, there was no reason to strike them. The court noted that the grand jury was inquiring into matters that the faculty members freely discussed in their classrooms and that was relevant to an investigation of misconduct.</SPAN></P>

The issuance of the subpoena does not of itself constitute a violation of the teachers' Fifth Amendment rights, and they may be compelled at the very least to attend the Grand Jury investigation.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the trial court's judgment dismissing defendant's petition alleging that he was denied parole in violation of his constitutional right to counsel and due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the crime of attempted grand larceny in the first degree and sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment. After defendant became eligible for parole, he was examined by the Board of Parole (board) and subsequently denied parole on the ground that he was then a poor risk. Defendant filed a petition for judicial review in the trial court to challenge the board's action as unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the petition and the court of appeals affirmed. The court affirmed and held that the trial court correctly refused to review the merits of defendant's claim. The court held that the parole release proceeding did not require an adversary hearing and that it did not involve constitutional due process. The court held further that defendant had no right to counsel, to confront and cross-examine witnesses, or to present evidence in his behalf in a parole release proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner distiller appealed from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which reversed a trial court order granting the distiller's petition to the extent of remanding the matter to respondent State Liquor Authority and dismissed the petition challenging the Authority's disapproval of an application for a brand label registration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Authority withheld approval of a brand label registration under N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect; 107-a with regard to the distiller's eight-year-old bourbon on the ground that shortly before the date of the application, the distiller had withdrawn from sale in New York a six-year-old bourbon bearing a similar brand name and sold at lower prices. The distiller brought a proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 to compel the Authority to approve the label. The trial court held that the denial of registration was arbitrary and capricious and remanded to the Authority. The appellate court reversed, holding that &sect; 107-a gave the Authority discretion so as to give effect to N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect; 101-b, and that the Authority's action was not reviewable. Reversing, the court held that as the two products were different from each other, the Authority's attempted regulation was beyond the scope of its statutory powers. As the proposed label was not deceptive or incomplete, and the products were different, there was no lawful basis to deny the application.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Intoxicating liquors -- brand label registration -- State Liquor Authority lacked power to prevent distiller from withdrawing from sale in New York six-year-old bourbon and offering at higher price similarly named but different eight-year-old bourbon instead -- Authority's attempted regulation is reviewable under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 121 of Alcoholic Beverage Control Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Nothing in paragraph (a) of subdivision 4 of section 107-a of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, which provides that no liquor &quot;shall be labeled, offered or advertised for sale&quot; unless done in accordance with regulations of the State Liquor Authority and unless &quot;the brand or trade name label&quot; affixed to the container of the beverage &quot;shall have been registered with and approved by the authority and the appropriate fee paid&quot;, prevents petitioner from withdrawing its six-year-old bourbon from the New York market and offering, at a higher price, a similarly named but clearly labeled and concededly different eight-year-old bourbon whiskey instead.  There is nothing in the affirmation section (Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, &sect; 101-b, subd. 3, pars. [d]-[i]) which requires a distiller of whiskey to offer its products in New York at prices not higher than the lowest prices at which it sells them in any other State, that confers on the Authority the power to forbid a distiller to withdraw one of its products from sale in New York or to make the offering of one of a distiller's products a condition to the approval of a label for a different product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since the Authority's attempted regulation lies beyond the scope of its statutory powers, its action, purportedly under section 107-a, is reviewable. Moreover,  even if its action were within section 107-a, its action would constitute the &quot;[refusal] * * * to issue * * * a permit&quot; within section 121 and thus be reviewable. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation sought review of an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which unanimously affirmed an order of the trial court in a proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78(1) denying the corporation's application for a refund of mortgage recording taxes from respondent Register of the City of New York, County of New York.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation applied to the register for an exemption from the mortgage recording tax, which was denied. The corporation then applied to the state tax commission for a refund of the taxes. On March 20, 1967, the commission ordered a refund and directed the recording officer of New York County to make the refund, which he refused to do. Shortly thereafter, the legislature amended N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 251 to grant the city a right to seek review of adverse commission determinations. The law was made retroactive to commission determinations made after January 1, 1967. The corporation then filed for a proceeding in the trial court under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78(1), which the trial court dismissed. The appellate division affirmed the order of dismissal. On appeal, the court reversed the order of the appellate division and granted the corporation's petition. The court held that the corporation had obtained a &quot;vested right&quot; in the refund and that the statutory amendment could not alter the right to repayment. The court stated that the retroactive provision was enacted without any discernable reason and that its application to the corporation constituted a due process violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order that denied the corporation's application to compel the register to refund mortgage recording taxes, and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An amendment to section 251 of the Tax Law which authorizes the City of New York to obtain judicial review of determinations of the New York State Tax Commission is unconstitutional when applied retroactively to determinations which were unreviewable on the date the amendment was enacted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Accordingly, where the State Tax Commission ordered respondent on March 20, 1967 to refund to petitioner a mortgage recording tax in the amount of $ 67,500, collected over petitioner's application for an exemption on the ground that no loans of new money were involved, and it is conceded that such order was final and not subject to review, an amendment of section 251 of the Tax Law effected by the signing into law of chapter 499 of the Laws of 1967 on April 24, 1967 authorizing the city to seek review of an adverse determination of the State Tax Commission retroactive to January 1, 1967 cannot alter petitioner's right to payment. Courts view with great suspicion the type of retroactive legislation here involved and, absent any showing of public interest to be served by this retroactive legislation, it should not be sanctioned. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant village sought review of a decision of an appellate court (New York) which affirmed an opinion holding that an amendment to a zoning ordinance that barred the construction of multiple dwellings was constitutionally invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village asserted that its amendment to its zoning ordinance was proper because its purpose was to prevent an increase in the amount of effluent discharged into its sewer system until construction of improved sewer facilities was completed. The court rejected the village's contention, finding that the amendment was an improper use of zoning power because the amendment was not properly related to zoning purposes and because it restricted the use of respondent property owner's land to a use for which it was not adaptable. The court ruled that the amendment was impermissible because it singled out the property owner's land on the basis of a general condition in the community rather than a condition caused by the nature of the property owner's land. The court noted that the amendment constituted a taking of the property owner's land that was permissible only through the power of eminent domain because the amendment destroyed the value of the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the lower court. The court held that the village's amendment was improper because the amendment was not within the limits of necessity and permanently prevented the property owner from the use of his land for the only purposes to which it was practically adapted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- amendment to zoning ordinance of Village of South Nyack, which barred new construction of multiple dwellings throughout village in order to alleviate burden on village's sewage disposal plant, was not properly related to zoning purposes and restricted plaintiff's property to use for which it is not adaptable and is, therefore, invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An amendment to the zoning ordinance of the Village of South Nyack, which barred the new construction of multiple dwellings throughout the village in order to alleviate the burden on the village's sewage disposal plant, was not properly related to zoning purposes and restricted plaintiff's property to a use for which it is not adaptable and is, therefore,  invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The village concededly rezoned plaintiff's land to prevent an increase in the amount of effluent discharged into its sewer system, pending the construction of improved sewer facilities.  The sanitation problem that would be created by the construction of a garden apartment development was not due to the inadequacy of the sewer lines and pumping station.  Rather, the problem was the hazard of increased pollution of the Hudson River, after inadequate treatment of the sewage effluent. The sanitation problem is general to the community and not caused by the nature of plaintiff's land.  It is not permissible to make this plaintiff bear a heavy financial burden because of a general condition in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The amendment was also improper because it was not adopted in furtherance of a comprehensive plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The amendment, which is not limited to any period of time, effectively prevents plaintiff from using its land for any purpose to which it is reasonably adapted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The village may, pursuant to its other and general police powers, impose other restrictions or conditions on the granting of a building permit to plaintiff, but the restraint must be kept within the limits of necessity and may not prevent permanently the reasonable use of private property for the only purpose for which it is practically adapted. </SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court has jurisdiction of the present proceeding brought by her committee against the director of the hospital for a declaration that the change of her status was null and void (Mental Hygiene Law, &sect; 100).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The detention of an involuntary patient is subject to court review (&sect; 73), and he or a relative or friend may obtain a jury trial on the issue of his sanity (&sect; 74).  In addition, the Mental Health Information Service, which performs services for the voluntary patient only upon his request, must be notified of an involuntary patient's admission and is charged with a duty to study and review his admission and retention and provide him and other interested parties with advice and relevant information (&sect; 88).  A withholding of these safeguards from those converted to voluntary status would deny them the equal protection of the laws and, perhaps, due process of law.  The constitutionality of the statute is preserved by reading into it a requirement that a mentally ill patient, converted from involuntary to voluntary status, must be accorded these rights which are available to those who are in hospitals on an involuntary basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer sought review of an order from the lower court ordering the Superintendent of Insurance (Superintendent) to take possession of appellant's property. Appellant asserted that it was denied due process and not given an opportunity to dispute whether it was insolvent. The Superintendent argued that it had the power to take appellant's property without affording appellant a hearing. The appeals court reversed the lower courts' judgment holding that appellant was entitled to a full hearing and an opportunity to offer proof regarding its insolvency. The appeals court held that a fair reading of N.Y. Ins. Law &sect;&sect; 23, 30, 512, 521, and 526 resulted in the conclusion that an evidentiary hearing was required. The appeals court expressly rejected the Superintendent's argument. The appeals court further held that the offer of proof at the trial level was insufficient because appellant was prevented from introducing any contradictory evidence of solvency.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Superintendent of Insurance determined after an examination that an insurance company was insolvent and brought a proceeding under article XVI of the Insurance Law to rehabilitate the company.  Section 526 thereof provides that after a &quot;full hearing&quot; the court shall either deny or grant the application to rehabilitate. At the hearing, the Superintendent offered in evidence the report of insolvency but the insurance company was not allowed to introduce any evidence in support of its claim that it was solvent.  The company was denied a &quot;full hearing&quot; and the order should be reversed and the case remitted for further proceedings.  Analysis of the provisions of the Insurance Law indicate that section 526 was not intended to provide a summary proceeding. By using the phrase &quot;full hearing&quot; the Legislature is presumed to have intended that the procedures normally followed by judicial tribunals would be continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since the insurer was not permitted to offer evidence to controvert the claim that the insurer was insolvent, the Appellate Division improperly concluded that the insurer's offer of proof was insufficient to put solvency in issue.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of murder in the first degree, attempted murder in the first degree, and attempted robbery in the first degree. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) affirmed the convictions. Defendants sought further review of their convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants stabbed their victim to death and fled. Subsequent to their arrest, they were convicted and sentenced. Their convictions were affirmed by the intermediate court, but reversed by the court because of trial errors that deprived defendants of a fair trial and resulted in a constitutionally defective trial. The court held that the prime error that compelled reversal and a new trial as to all defendants was the implication of defendants in the crime by the confessions and statements of some of their codefendants, who testified for the state. Particularly, certain defendants' statements were admitted as evidence against other defendants when the former did not testify at trial. The improper admission of statements by nontestifying defendants without any attempt to redact them violated the defendants' constitutional right to confront their accusers. The court then turned to the second error that mandated reversal as to one defendant. This defendant's confession was obtained after he had been surrendered to the police by his attorney for the purposes of arraignment. Police obtained the statement after his attorney had made it clear that he wished his client to make no statement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendants' judgments of conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- murder -- admission of statements by witnesses that some of defendants inculpated codefendants violated right to confront accusers -- error was prejudicial -- statements not redactable -- statements taken by police in absence of attorney inadmissible -- seizure of sweater on warrant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> permitting search for knife violated Fourth Amendment -- new trial granted as to all defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. At a joint trial all six of the defendants were found guilty of murder in the first degree, attempted murder in the first degree and attempted robbery in the first degree.  During questioning by the prosecutor, the witness Barnes and a detective testified that some of the defendants made statements inculpating their codefendants. The admission of these statements violated the defendants' constitutional right to confront their accusers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The error cannot be ignored upon the ground that no proper objection was made since, in this case tried prior to the decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Bruton </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> United States</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (391 U.S. 123), their admission under limiting instructions was proper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Because of the manner in which the oral confessions and statements were used at the trial, the error cannot be disregarded as nonprejudicial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. None of the written statements or confessions were and none could be effectively redacted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. There must, therefore, be a new trial, not only as to the three nonconfessing defendants but as to the confessing defendants as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The statements taken by the police and the Assistant District Attorney from defendant Baker after his attorney had left the police station, having made it clear that he wished his client to make no statement and to be present at any questioning of said defendant, were inadmissible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The seizure of a sweater allegedly worn by one of the attackers on a warrant permitting the search for a knife violated the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution and the evidence should not have been received.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Warden </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Hayden</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 387 U.S. 294, distinguished.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. After cross-examination, Barnes was permitted to testify that he had given the same account to the detective when called out of the &quot;bullpen&quot; shortly after his incriminating admission to a narcotics addict.  Later, the detective testified to this original conversation. This testimony was not improper.  A portion of the attack on Barnes was based on events arising subsequent to the initial confrontation with the detective. Therefore, it was not error for the court to admit the testimony of Barnes on redirect and of the detective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. A certain witness' testimony before the Grand Jury concerning her photographic identification of defendant Felder was admissible. The witness,  who was in the drugstore at the time of the murder, identified defendant Felder as one of the persons she saw running away from the murder scene.  In addition, she was permitted to testify that she had identified a photograph of Felder before the Grand Jury.  On cross-examination, it was brought out that she had testified before the Grand Jury that she did not recognize some of the boys that she saw running around the corner.  On redirect, the People sought to correct this impression that she had not recognized the boys.  A party may read another pertinent portion of a statement used for the purposes of impeachment to correct a false impression that reading only a part of the statement may give.  Thus the statement here was admissible for purposes of showing that there was in fact no contradiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. As there is no evidence that defendants Hamm or Rice were ever given </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings by the police, the jury should have been charged that the absence of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings should be considered on the question of voluntariness of the confessions or admissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. Better practice would suggest that the court should itemize the pieces of evidence which could be considered by the jury as corroborative of testimony that a defendant had participated in the crime.  </SPAN></P>

The president and the union refused to comply with the terms of the injunction, and criminal contempt orders were issued.

The court held that the statutory prohibition against strikes by public employees was reasonably designed to effectuate a valid State policy in an area where the State had authority to act.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1.

The informations did not show the source of the troopers' information and the foundation for their belief. The defendants challenged their convictions.

Consequently, the court found that the trial courts were not deprived of jurisdiction because the information was made by an officer having no personal knowledge of the relevant events.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent board of education sought a criminal contempt order against defendants, teachers and union, claiming that they had willfully disobeyed a temporary injunction and violated &sect; 210(1) of the Taylor Law, N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law art. 14, &sect;&sect; 200-212. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) affirmed the denial of the teachers and union's motions for a jury trial. The teachers and union appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teachers and union argued that the legislature intended to apply N.Y. Jud. Law &sect;753-a and N.Y. Lab.

Lab. Law &sect; 807 was specifically inapplicable to injunctions to restrain violations of &sect; 210(1), no similar exclusionary language applied to &sect; 808. On appeal, the court held that the Taylor Law was never intended to, and did not, make provision for jury trials in contempt enforcement proceedings and that the reference therein to &sect; 807 could not possibly create a right to a jury trial under &sect; 808. The court further found that the denial of a jury trial to public employees was not a constitutional violation because a reasonable distinction could be drawn between public and private employment. Finally, the court held that the teachers and union were not entitled to jury trial under the Fourteenth Amendment because, based on the possible punishment if the teachers and union were found guilty, the offense was petty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Public employees and the unions which represent them are not entitled, as a matter of right, to trial by jury in a criminal contempt proceeding brought against them for alleged volation of the Taylor Law (L. 1967, ch.  392; Civil Service Law, art. 14, &sect;&sect; 200-212), in that the employees engaged in a strike and the organizations instigated, encouraged or condoned such strike.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff investor brought suit against defendant bank of Cuba for breach of contract. The trial court entered a judgment in favor of investor. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department affirmed the trial court's judgment. Bank of Cuba appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Investor purchased land in Cuba. Investor obtained a certificate of tax exemption from Cuba, which stated the owner of the certificate would receive from the bank of Cuba the appropriate amount of American dollars. Subsequently, the Cuban government adopted a regulation, which prevented American and other foreign investors from receiving currency other than Cuban pesos on their Cuban investments. The court determined that bank of Cuba was not entitled to sovereign immunity from the suit, because its activities were commercial in nature. The court concluded that the regulation of the Cuban government was an act of state, which American courts were required to give effect to that act of state. Since the record established that there was no taking of property to which a claim of title or other rights was asserted, the Hickenlooper Amendment did not apply; therefore the court was not required to disregard such an act of state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's judgment and dismissed investor's complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Banks and banking -- certificates of Cuban Currency Stabilization Fund -- after American investor in Cuban farm acquired certificates issued by Currency Stabilization Fund of Cuban Government, providing that, upon delivery of appropriate number of pesos and surrender of certificates, he would receive from Banco Nacional de Cuba check for equal amount of American dollars, Fund issued decision suspending processing of such certificates -- bank thereafter refused to pay him in American dollars, under mandate of said decision -- in action by investor's assignee against bank, based upon breach of contract, complaint is dismissed -- although bank is not entitled to sovereign immunity from suit, actions complained of constitute act of state to which court is required to give effect -- application</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> of act of state doctrine is not barred by Hickenlooper Amendment -- although it is not necessary to reach question, action of Cuban Government, taken to protect Cuba's foreign exchange reserves, did not violate international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An American citizen acquired eight certificates, aggregating $ 150,000, each signed by Banco Nacional de Cuba and the Currency Stabilization Fund and each providing that, upon delivery of an appropriate number of Cuban pesos and surrender of the certificate, he would receive from the bank a check for an equal amount of American dollars, exempt from an exportation tax.  Prior to his attempted redemption of the certificates, the Currency Stabilization Fund issued a &quot;Decision&quot; suspending the &quot;processing&quot; of such certificates &quot;until reorganization of the system of exemptions&quot;.  When the American tendered his certificates, with the appropriate number of Cuban pesos, the bank, under the mandate of the &quot;Decision&quot;, refused to pay him in American dollars. In this action by his assignee against the bank, based upon breach of contract, the court declines to accord the bank sovereign immunity from suit as an agency of the Cuban Government.  The State Department has concluded that the activities out of which the action arose were of a commercial nature and its position is that immunity should not be granted in such cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. However, the complaint must be dismissed since the actions complained of constitute an act of state to which the court is required to give effect ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Banco Nacional de Cuba </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Sabbatino</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 376 U.S. 398). The alleged breach of contract resulted from, and itself constituted, an act of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Application of the act of state doctrine is not barred by the Hickenlooper Amendment to the Federal Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, enacted to &quot;reverse in part&quot; the decision in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Sabbatino</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">).  That amendment declares that &quot;no court in the United States shall decline on the ground of the federal act of state doctrine to make a determination on the merits * * * in a case in which a claim of title or other right to property is asserted by any party including a foreign state * * * based upon (or traced through) a confiscation or other taking * * * by an act of that state in violation of the principles of international law.&quot; The loss suffered by plaintiff's assignor was due, not to a &quot;taking&quot;, but to the breach of a promise upon which he had relied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Moreover, even if his title to, and right to enforce, his contract rights had been taken over by the Cuban Government, such a confiscation would be outside the compass of the Hickenlooper Amendment. The amendment does not cover ordinary contract rights, or anything other than specific, identifiable and &quot;traceable&quot; property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In view of this determination, it is not necessary to reach the question of whether the action of the Cuban Government was &quot;in violation of the principles of international law&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In any event, since the control of national currency and foreign exchange is an essential governmental function and there is no question that the action here complained of was aimed at protecting Cuba's foreign exchange reserves, it may not be characterized as so unreasonable or unjust as to outrage current international standards of governmental conduct.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hospital challenged the decision of appellee industrial commission and the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) affirmed the trial court decision granting the commission summary judgment and dismissing the hospital's claim without prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The labor board certified a union as the bargaining representative of the maintenance employees at the hospital. The hospital thereafter refused to bargain collectively with it on the ground that it did not represent the employees as it claimed. The hospital brought the actions seeking to enjoin a fact-finding panel appointed by the commission from functioning and to stay compulsory arbitration proceeding directed by the commission. The court was required to decide whether an issue as to representation was a dispute under N.Y. Labor Law &sect; 716(1). The court found that &sect; 716 could not be invoked by a group of employees or by a minority union to arbitrate disputes with a nonprofitmaking hospital. The commissioner, therefore, lacked the authority to appoint the fact-finding panel and to send the issue to compulsory arbitration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The orders appealed from were reversed and the appellant's application for a declaration regarding the commission's lack of authority and for an order permanently staying the arbitration order was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labor unions -- collective bargaining in nonprofitmaking hospital -- arbitration -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 716 of Labor Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, which empowers Industrial Commissioner to submit &quot;dispute&quot; between nonprofitmaking hospital and union to fact-finding commission and, in event of rejection of commission findings, to compulsory and binding arbitration, may not be invoked where employer institution challenges representation status of union -- as defined in said section, &quot;dispute&quot; encompasses only economic and union security issues and does not embrace representation issues, which are left for resolution to Labor Relations Board -- accordingly, where nonprofitmaking hospital refused to bargain with union certified by Labor Relations Board, basing refusal on ground that union did not represent employees, and union invoked provisions of section 716 rather than filing unfair labor practice charge with Labor Relations Board, hospital is entitled to declaration that Industrial Commissioner had no authority to appoint</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> fact-finding commission and is entitled to stay of compulsory arbitration proceeding until union's certification has been judicially reviewed and found valid -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">legislation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> to avoid undue delay suggested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 716 of the Labor Law, newly enacted in 1963, which empowers the Industrial Commissioner or the State Board of Mediation to submit a &quot;dispute&quot; between a nonprofitmaking hospital or residential care center and a union to a fact-finding commission and, in the event of rejection of the findings of the commission, to compulsory and binding arbitration, may not be invoked where the employer institution challenges the representation status of the union.  As defined in section 716, a &quot;dispute&quot; encompasses only economic and union security issues.  It does not embrace representation issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Accordingly, where a nonprofitmaking hospital refused to bargain collectively with a union which had been certified by the State Labor Relations Board as the bargaining representative of its maintenance employees, basing its refusal upon the ground that the union did not represent the employees as it claimed, and the union invoked the provisions of section 716 rather than following the judicially accepted method of filing with the Labor Relations Board an unfair labor practice charge based on the hospital's refusal to bargain, the hospital is entitled to a declaration that the Industrial Commissioner had no authority to appoint a fact-finding commission and is entitled to an order staying a compulsory arbitration proceeding until the union's certification has been judicially reviewed and found valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The court suggests to the Legislature that all undue delay could be avoided by legislation requiring that certification and refusal to bargain proceedings be expedited and that the period for the prosecution of appeals from the board's ensuing orders be shortened.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff railroads appealed the order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which modified and affirmed the trial court's order in favor of defendants, state and state agencies (State) and intervenor union. The railroads argued that N.Y. R.R. Law &sect; 54-b was invalid and that it violated the U.S. and N.Y. Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railroads filed suit against the State seeking a declaratory judgment to invalidate the full crew laws under N.Y. R.R. Law &sect;&sect; 54-a, 54-b, 54-c, and seeking to enjoin their enforcement. The union intervened. The trial court dismissed. While the railroads' appeal was pending, the legislature repealed N.Y. R.R. Law &sect;&sect; 54-a and 54-c, but refused to repeal N.Y. R.R. Law &sect; 54-b. The appellate court affirmed the trial court, modifying only to explicitly declare that &sect; 54-b was constitutional. The railroads appealed. The court affirmed. Although &sect; 54-b added substantial costs to the railroads' freight operations, and despite the fact that it was adopted in 1936 and might have been outmoded, &sect; 54-b was valid. It did not violate the due process and equal protection clauses of the U.S Constitution or the N.Y. Constitution, and was within the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution. The railroad's argument that &sect; 54-b was confiscatory was not sustained by the record. Section 54-b was not a burden on interstate commerce. The requirements of &sect; 54-b were validly related to railroad safety, so in the absence of federal preemption , they were a valid exercise of the State's police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court, upholding the constitutionality of the State's full crew law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- railroad full crew laws -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 54-b of Railroad Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, prohibiting operation on any railroad within New York State of any fuel-electric engine unless it is manned</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> with crew of &quot;not less than one engineer and one fireman or helper&quot;, is constitutional -- by expression &quot;and one fireman or helper&quot;, Legislature intended to require assignment of either fireman or engine crewman equivalent to fireman to assist engineer -- assignment of brakeman from train crew does not meet this requirement -- requirement is constitutionally valid exercise of police power of State since it serves rational purpose in promotion of safety -- section does not deprive railroads of due process or equal protection of laws and does not constitute burden on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 54-b of the Railroad Law, prohibiting the operation on any railroad within New York State of any fuel-electric, or diesel, engine unless it is manned with a crew of &quot;not less than one engineer and one fireman or helper&quot;, is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. By the expression &quot;and one fireman or helper&quot;, the Legislature intended to require the assignment of either a fireman or an engine crewman equivalent to a fireman to assist the engineer. The assignment of a brakeman from the train crew does not meet this requirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The legislative intention to require the &quot;helper&quot; to be a member of the engine crew, as distinguished from the train crew, is made clear by reading section 54-b together with section 54-a of the Railroad Law, enacted in 1913 and repealed in 1966, and section 54-c, enacted in 1937 and repealed in 1966 along with section 54-a.  Section 54-a, the original full crew law, was addressed to steam operations and required a freight train of more than 25 cars to be manned with a crew of not less than one engineer and one fireman, jobs only related to the engine, and one conductor and three brakemen, jobs only related to the train. In 1936, when section 54-b was enacted, diesel engines did not, and still do not, have a special identifying name for an engine crew member additional to the engineer and, if the purpose of the section was to require an additional man on the engine crew, the safe approach was to use the then well-understood term &quot;fireman&quot;, even though it had no literal application to diesel engines, and, to give free scope to the statute, add &quot;or helper&quot;.  This language suggests the intention to continue the distinction made by section 54-a between the engine crew and the train crew. This intention is further indicated by the enactment during the following year of section 54-c, which affected both steam and diesel engines and required, in switching and transfer operations, a crew of not less than &quot;one engineer, one fireman or helper, one conductor or foreman and two trainmen or two helpers&quot;.  Also of significance is the fact that the Public Service Commission, which extensively examined all three sections encompassing the full crew policy of the State, construed section 54-b as requiring a fireman or the engine-crew equivalent of a fireman in the diesel engine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The requirement is a constitutionally valid exercise of the police power of the State since it serves some rational purpose in the promotion of safety.  Findings have been made, and affirmed, that, in road freight service, the fireman is frequently the only crew member in position to take and pass signals and act as a lookout and, in all types of service, he is the only employee in the cab who may be expected to be capable of relieving the engineer in case of fatigue or emergency.  A factual conclusion has been made, and affirmed, that it is not unreasonable to require, for safety, the presence in the engine cab of a second man who has, in addition to the ability to act as a lookout and to read and pass signals, the training and qualifications which are ordinarily possessed by firemen and which may make it possible for him to be of assistance to the engineer in the operation of the locomotive. The evidence is legally sufficient to support the essential factual conclusion on which the declaration of the constitutionality of section 54-b is based.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The section does not deprive the railroads of due process or equal protection of the laws and does not constitute a burden on interstate commerce.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants in three consolidated appeals sought review of decisions from the Supreme Court of the Second Judicial Department (New York), which adjudged them wayward minors and imposed sentence accordingly. Defendants asserted the trial court erred in determining they were wayward minors and challenged the constitutionality of the statute for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One defendant was disobedient to her parents by dating someone much older, a second was disobedient to his mother, stayed out late and associated with persons of whom she disapproved, and the third was disobedient to his parents, addicted to narcotic drugs, and stole money from home. Defendants were teenagers between the ages of 16 and 21, were adjudged wayward minors, and were sentenced to state reformatory institutions. In their consolidated appeal, defendants challenged the constitutionality of the statute but the court refused to reconsider the issue because it was previously sustained. The court reversed the convictions of all three defendants holding that the statute required a finding that a minor was either &quot;disobedient to parents&quot; or had &quot;deserted his home&quot; in conjunction with a separate finding that the minor was either &quot;morally depraved&quot; or &quot;in danger of becoming morally depraved&quot; before a minor could be adjudged a wayward minor within the meaning of the statute and sentenced to a reformatory facility. The court held that in each of the cases, the minor was lacking the combination necessary for such a finding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the trial court finding defendants to be wayward minors as to all three defendants. The court dismissed charges against two defendants and remitted the third case for consideration of mental health treatment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Infants -- wayward</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> minors -- 18-year-old girl, in conflict with her parents and disobedient to them, and boy between 17 and 19 years old, disobedient and abusive to his mother, not shown to be &quot;morally depraved&quot; or &quot;in danger of becoming morally depraved&quot; (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 913-a, subds. [5], [6]) and, therefore, not wayward minors -- complaints against them dismissed -- third defendant essentially narcotic addict rather than wayward minor -- charge against him remitted for consideration of treatment under article 9 of Mental Hygiene Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendants were adjudicated to be wayward minors under a statute (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 913-a, subds. [5], [6]), which requires proof that the minor is &quot;morally depraved&quot; or &quot;is in danger of becoming morally depraved&quot;.  In the one case an 18-year-old girl was in conflict with her father concerning her conduct.  She had formed an attachment to a man 30 years of age, to whom her parents objected, and her father stated that she had a key to his apartment. There was no proof of sexual intercourse and she herself denied it.  The record shows that this defendant is in growing conflict with her parents and disobedient to them within the terms of the statute,  but it fails to show that she is &quot;morally depraved&quot; or &quot;in danger of becoming morally depraved&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In another case a boy, at the time of trial, between 17 and 19 years old, was said by his mother to have disobeyed her, stayed out late, been abusive to her and associated with people of whom she did not approve. She also believed he used narcotics, but he denied using them.  There was no proof of any substantive act except disobedience and being abusive. The proof did not justify his adjudication as a wayward minor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In the third case the proof was adequate that defendant was addicted to narcotic drugs.  Essentially he is a narcotic addict and needed treatment, rather than a wayward minor.  The charge against him should be remitted for the court to consider treatment under article 9 of the Mental Hygiene Law. As to the other two defendants the complaints should be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant alleged drug addict challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which reversed a judgment of the trial court directing the release of the addict from the custody of respondent Narcotic Addiction Control Commission and directed that the addict be returned to the custody of the Commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon the affidavit of the addict's mother, the addict was arrested and placed in the custody of the Commission. The addict was detained for three days prior to being brought before the trial court, at which time an examining physician testified that the addict was dependant on narcotic drugs. A hearing was held 10 days later, and the addict was certified to be an addict. The addict sought a jury trial, and after trial, the jury found him to be a drug addict. Thereafter, the trial court ordered the addict released from custody upon the ground that the procedure mandated by New York Narcotics Control Act of 1966, N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 206, for the compulsory apprehension and detention of the addict violated his constitutional rights. The appeals court reversed, and on appeal, the court reversed the appeals court and reinstated the judgment of the trial court. The court held that while the Act was a valid and legitimate exercise of police power, the procedural provisions contained in the Act deprived the addict of due process of law as provided by the Fourteenth Amendment. There was no justification for holding the addict for three days without notice or an opportunity to be heard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner estate administrator appealed, and respondent state cross-appealed, from an order of the Appellate Division (New York), which reversed a decree of the trial court that declined to release funds impounded from the decedent's estate for satisfaction of the estate administrator's previously obtained default judgment against a nonresident estate beneficiary's bequest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The beneficiary was unable to claim a portion of the decedent's estate pursuant to &sect; 269-a of the Surrogate's Court Act, N.Y. Surr. Ct. Proc. Act 2218, which impounded the amount bequeathed her until the court was satisfied it would be used for her benefit. The administrator claimed that the beneficiary owed him certain sums, and he produced a letter in which she purportedly acknowledged a promise to repay him. In remanding the matter, the court concluded that the law impounding such funds was not unconstitutional, but the effect of the default judgment required determination. The court ruled that the impounding was not proscribed under existing caselaw, and that the trial court acquired the necessary jurisdiction to enter judgment in the administrator's favor upon the beneficiary's default. In consequence of the statute's constitutionality, however, the court held that the default judgment did not automatically entitle the administrator to satisfaction from the impounded funds. Instead, he was required to satisfy the trial court that the purposes of the restraint would not be frustrated, and that the funds would not be vulnerable to confiscation in a foreign country.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the cause of action be remanded to the trial court for a hearing and further findings as to the default judgment, but concluded that the impounding of the funds was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Former section 269-a of the Surrogate's Court Act (now SCPA 2218) provided that, where the beneficiary of a decedent's estate &quot;would not have the benefit or use or control of the money or other property due him&quot;, such property must be paid into court &quot;for the benefit of [such beneficiary] or such person or persons who may thereafter appear to be entitled thereto&quot;.  A beneficiary of decedent's estate was a resident of the Soviet Union and her share of the estate was impounded pursuant to an order of the Surrogate.  If the courts of this State, in applying the &quot;benefit or use or control&quot; requirements, determine whether or not a foreign country, by statute or otherwise, prevents its residents from actually sharing in the estates of New York decedents, the statute would not be unconstitutional under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Zschernig </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Miller</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (389 U.S. 429) as interference in the field of foreign affairs reserved to the President and Congress.  Consequently the impounding of the beneficiary's share was not proscribed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner, by warrant of attachment with respect to the sum due the Soviet beneficiary, obtained a default judgment against her based on a cause of action for money owed, relying on a letter from her wherein she promised to repay money he had sent her and suggesting that he try to obtain the money out of her inheritance.  A fund, although deposited in court, may be attached for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction.  In this matter the Supreme Court acquired jurisdiction and upon the beneficiary's default had power to enter judgment in favor of petitioner.  Petitioner's judgment, on the present record and with the present parties, is both legally effective and valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Petitioner, as a judgment creditor of the beneficiary, may be a person, upon impounding of the fund, &quot;who may thereafter appear to be entitled thereto&quot; within section 269-a.  The Surrogate has power to order satisfaction from the impounded fund if he first determined that such satisfaction would not conflict with the provisions or purposes of the statute.  There is no rule completely immunizing the impounded fund from all obligations derived from the beneficiary. Only those obligations are excluded which rest solely on the voluntary transfer by, or commitment of, the beneficiary in contradiction of his disability to control the fund.  The matter is remanded to enable the Surrogate to hold a hearing and make further findings concerning whether the underlying debt was a genuine one, in the sense that it was derived from an actual benefit to the beneficiary on a promise to pay, or was even a bona fide gift, and whether payment therefor to the judgment creditor would be solely for his use or benefit and would not be used directly or indirectly to defeat the purposes of the statute.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that the legislation creating the fund and providing that pari-mutuel race tracks should pay a percentage of &quot;breakage&quot; to the fund did not violate N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, which created an exception to the constitutional prohibition of gambling and permitted pari-mutuel betting on horse races as prescribed by the legislature and from which the state would derive a reasonable revenue for the support of government because harness racing was a source of substantial revenue for the support of government, and a certain portion of the revenues derived from racing could be set aside for the general improvement of the sport and the facilities used.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Agriculture and New York State Horse Breeding Development Fund, a public benefit corporation within the State Harness Racing Commission (Pari-Mutuel Revenue Law, &sect; 55-a, as added by L. 1965, ch. 567), derives its revenues from private racing associations which are required to pay to it 25% of the &quot;breaks&quot;.  The fund is authorized to deposit the moneys received in several segregated accounts and to disburse them for various programs designed to foster the continued growth and prosperity of the industry.  Section 9 of article I of the New York State Constitution permits pari-mutuel betting on horse races &quot;as may be prescribed by the legislature and from which the state shall derive a reasonable revenue for the support of government&quot;.  This provision does not require that all revenue in excess of expenses be devoted to the direct support of government or prohibit the Legislature, as a condition to granting a license to a private racing association, from requiring that a certain portion of the revenues derived from racing be set aside for the general improvement of the sport and the facilities used.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the State of New York (government), appealed a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of respondent city commissioner of street sanitation and denied the government's motion for summary judgment on the government's action to forfeit the commissioner's office for refusing to sign a waiver of immunity before a grand jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A grand jury conducted an inquiry into the commissioner's conduct while he was the head parking fee collector. He was subpoenaed before the grand jury, advised of the nature of the inquiry by the district attorney, offered a waiver of immunity covering his parking fee offices, and refused to sign it. The appellate court affirmed the grant of the commissioner's motion for summary judgment on the government's action brought pursuant to N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that reasonably construed to give sensible effect to its policy purpose, the provision embraced the office of parking fee collector. The constitutional policy was to require any man holding a place in public service, high or low, to choose between keeping his job and disclosing his knowledge of criminal wrongdoing in that place. A public official had the undoubted right to claim a constitutional privilege against self incrimination, but the government had a concomitant right to discharge him from his job if his refusal to testify related to his public employment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant, from April, 1954 to January, 1966, was the Acting Head Parking Fee Collector and Parking Fee Collector for the City of Buffalo.  In January, 1966 he was appointed Commissioner of Street Sanitation of the City of Buffalo.  The Grand Jury of Erie County, in March, 1966, conducted an inquiry into defendant's conduct of the parking fee collecting offices and, when he was subpoenaed before the Grand Jury, he refused to sign a waiver of immunity. In this action by the People and the Attorney-General to forfeit defendant's present office of Commissioner of Street Sanitation pursuant to section 6 of article I of the New York Constitution, which provides that &quot;any public officer&quot; who refuses to sign a waiver of immunity against a subsequent criminal prosecution when called before a Grand Jury to testify concerning his present office or &quot;any public office held by him&quot; within five years &quot;shall be removed from&quot; his present office or shall forfeit it at the suit of the Attorney-General, a motion by plaintiffs for summary judgment should be granted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, defendants sought review of orders from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) in which the court held that the method used by plaintiffs to serve defendants under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 308(4) was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In three cases consolidated for appeal, plaintiffs brought suits against defendants to recover for personal injuries sustained in an accident. Defendants objected to the method of service arguing that due process requirements were violated. Each defendant was served under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 308(4). The appeals court affirmed the lower court's judgment holding that the notice given was adequate to inform defendants of the lawsuit. The appeals court held that 308(1)-(3) delineated specific methods for serving a defendant. However, according to the appeals court, if service was impracticable under 308(1)-(3), then a plaintiff could serve a defendant by using any method prescribed by the court. The appeals court held that 308(4) was limited only by the constitutional safeguard of due process. The appeals court held that plaintiffs' need, the public interest, the reasonableness of plaintiffs' efforts under all the circumstances to inform defendants, and the availability of other safeguards for defendants' interests were factors determining whether notice was adequate and due process was met.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court affirmed the lower court's judgment in each case, holding that the method of service was adequate notice informing defendants of the lawsuit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Process -- service in such manner as court directs -- in action arising out of automobile accident in New York, if whereabouts of resident or of nondomiciliary defendant are unknown, court may, ex parte, direct manner of service ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CPLR 308</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> subd. 4) if reasonably calculated, under circumstances of case, to give notice -- circumstances of case include plaintiff's need and efforts, State's interest in motor vehicle control, defendant's failure to communicate, insurance carrier's presence in case, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CPLR 317</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> providing that defendant who does not receive notice may be allowed to defend within one year after he learns of judgment -- orders under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CPLR 308</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> (subd. 4), in three cases, directing service by mail to last known address and by other means, reasonable and proper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action against a natural person for damages for injury or death arising from an automobile accident in New York, if it is shown that the defendant's whereabouts are unknown and that it is impracticable to serve him personally or by delivery to a duly designated agent or by mailing and affixing (under CPLR 308, subds. 1, 2, 3), personal jurisdiction of him may nevertheless be obtained by service &quot;in such manner as the court&quot; ex parte &quot;directs&quot; ( CPLR 308, subd. 4).  An attachment is not a prerequisite to such an order.  Nor does the Vehicle and Traffic Law ( &sect;&sect; 253, 254) prescribe the sole method of service.  Nor do the methods set forth in CPLR 308 apply to residents only; they apply to nondomiciliaries too, except that the service must be made by certain categories of persons ( CPLR 302, 313).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The court's broad discretion in directing a method of service under CPLR 308 (subd. 4) is subject to the due process requirement that the method be reasonably calculated to give notice. However, what might be inadequate notice in the situation in one case might be reasonable and adequate in the circumstances of another case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In fashioning a method of notice sufficient to afford due process in the particular circumstances of a case, the court should consider the plaintiff's need and our State's interest as shown by the creation of the MVAIC (Insurance Law, art. 17-A) and the financial responsibility required in order to register a motor vehicle (Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 312).  Moreover, a person who has been involved in a motor vehicle accident knows that he is likely to be sued.  He should not unduly obstruct the process of law by sedulously avoiding communication with the victim and with his own insurance carrier or by failing to notify his own State licensing authorities of his changes of address.  The reasonableness of the plaintiff's efforts to inform the defendant should be judged in the light of such circumstances.  Furthermore, the court should take into account that the defendant's insurance carrier or the MVAIC may really be the party in interest and that they have been apprised of or are present in the case.  Finally, the court should consider that, if the defendant does not personally receive notice, he &quot;may be allowed to defend the action within one year after he obtains knowledge of entry of the judgment, but in no event more than five years after such entry&quot; ( CPLR 317).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Judged by the foregoing standards, proper orders for service under CPLR 308 (subd. 4) were made in each of these three cases; in all of them service was directed to be made by ordinary mail to defendants' last known addresses and in two of them by certain other means.  Accordingly, motions by the attorneys for the defendant's insurance carrier in one case and by the MVAIC in two cases to set aside the service were properly denied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner sought review of the order of the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the judgment of the trial court that Lake Success, N.Y., Building Zone Ordinance No. 60, which rezoned part of the landowner's property from a business district to a residential district, was valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower courts had found that the rezoning was not valid with respect to the parcel to the west of a road dividing the parcel, but was valid with respect to the parcel to the east of the dividing road. The court held that the rezoning ordinance was invalid with respect to both parts of the parcel. The court concluded that the rezoning was not done in accordance with the comprehensive plan of the municipality, noting that the change was not the result of a deliberate change in community policy and was enacted without sufficient forethought or planning. The court noted that the parcel had been zoned for business for the previous 20 years, and that as a result of the zoning change, the landowner would lose $ 260,000, or 60 percent of its value. The court also concluded that the zoning change was discriminatory, as there was no showing of purpose in distinguishing the two parcels, and in fact there was conflicting testimony as to the suitability of each of the parcels for particular uses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the intermediate appellate court was reversed, and the ordinance was declared ultra vires, unconstitutional, and void as to the landowner's property.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- amendment to village zoning ordinance reclassifying appellant's property from Business &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; to Residence &quot;C&quot; was ultra vires as not &quot;in accordance with a comprehensive plan&quot; (Village Law, &sect; 177), and was also invalid as constituting unjustifiable discrimination and arbitrary imposition on rights of appellant who would sustain substantial loss by operation of ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A 1960 ordinance amending the Building Zone Ordinance of the Village of Lake Success by reclassifying appellant's property from Business &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; to Residence &quot;C&quot; must be held to be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">ultra vires</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as not meeting the requirement of section 177 of the Village Law that zoning be &quot;in accordance with a comprehensive plan&quot;.  Accordingly, the ordinance was invalid with respect to that part of appellant's land located on the east side of Lakeville Road, a main north-south traffic artery of the village. The amendment did not conform to the village's general development policy as set forth in a 1958 statement of zoning policy, and was also inconsistent with what had, for more than 20 years, been the fundamental rationale of the village's zoning law and map. Moreover,  the radical change from business to residential use, recommended by the village planning board on the evening of the same day on which appellant's associate had submitted a preliminary sketch for development of the area with a bowling alley and supermarket, and adopted a month or so later, was not the result of a deliberate change in community policy, but was enacted without sufficient foresight or planning, and was not supported by any particular conditions existing in the area.  This race to the statute books was not in accord with sound zoning principles and the root cause of this failure was a basic misconception of the nature of zoning. Even assuming that, as the village argues, there was no longer any need for shopping facilities in the area, this would not explain why consideration was given only to rezoning the area as residential, whereas the community's need for taxables, as set forth in its &quot;developmental policy&quot; statement, required consideration of other possible land use controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Furthermore, the ordinance was invalid as constituting unjustifiable discrimination.  In finding that the amendment discriminated against that portion of appellant's property on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">west</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> side of Lakeville Road because the rezoning did not include a nearby retail service area, the trial court pointed out that there was nothing to differentiate between these two properties, and, moreover, that the amendment likewise discriminated against the appellant's premises on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">east</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> side, the subject of this appeal, for that same reason (and, additionally, because most of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">east</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> parcel was already being used for a nonconforming commercial use as a restaurant).  By thereafter rezoning the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">west</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> parcel into a new Business &quot;C&quot; category and by withdrawing its appeal from the trial court's holding the amendment invalid as discriminating against that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">west</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> parcel, the village thus accepted such finding of invalidity. That being so, the village was bound to show that dissimilar treatment of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">east</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> parcel was still warranted.  However, the village offered no acceptable reason to justify the distinction.  Although the serious traffic conditions on Lakeville Road might have substantially justified the rezoning, the village's expert testified that business use of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">east</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> parcel would create less of a traffic problem than such use of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">west</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> parcel so that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">west</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> parcel should be restricted to residential use, but the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">east</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> parcel could properly be zoned for nonresidential use inasmuch as access thereto could be restricted to another street.  That concession removed any basis for argument that needs of the zoning plan required different treatments of the east and west parcels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Consideration of the fact that, beside the lack of any showing of purpose in distinguishing the two parcels, the appellant would sustain a substantial loss -- amounting to some 60% of the property value, or $ 260,000 -- if the zoning change is upheld makes the invalidity of the ordinance unquestionably clear.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant director of county sales tax (director) challenged the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which held that (1) certain sales and use taxes could not be imposed on the receipts from sales and services made or rendered to respondent bank, and (2) directed the director to refund the taxes collected from the bank.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank claimed that because it was an instrumentality of the United States Government it was immune from sales and use taxes imposed by the state and county. The trial court agreed, prohibiting the director from levying the taxes and ordering him to refund taxes paid. On appeal, the bank claimed that a national bank was an instrumentality of the federal government. The court found that while immunity was justified during the period when national banks issued currency, the tax-immune status of current national banks was not based on its issuance of currency. The court held that the bank did not qualify for immunity because the bank performed no governmental service and the taxes were not discriminatory. Privately owned businesses that performed services for the government and/or operated by virtue of a federal charter were not per se immune from nondiscriminatory state taxation which did not impede the performance of their service for government. The judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Liberty National Bank and Trust Company is not such an instrumentality of the United States Government as would make it immune as a purchaser from sales and use taxes imposed by the State of New York and Erie County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. National banks perform no governmental functions.  Like State banks, they are privately owned and operated.  Also like State banks, they are depositories for Federal funds.  And, like any private enterprise engaging in activities affected with a public interest, they are subject to severe government regulation, which is accomplished through membership in the Federal Reserve System -- membership which is open to State banks upon a voluntary basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Privately owned and operated business enterprises, which perform services for the government or exist and operate by virtue of a Federal charter or franchise, are not impliedly immune from State taxation, provided that the taxation does not impede the performance of their service for the government or the right which the government charter or franchise granted and, further, that the taxation does not discriminate against the federally chartered institutions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion to vacate the attachment on jurisdictional and due process grounds. The trial court denied the motion, and the intermediate court affirmed. The question was certified as to whether the trial court's order denying defendant's motion was properly made. The court answered in the affirmative, holding that the contractual obligation of the insurance company to its insured under its liability policy constituted a debt under N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, an author and a publisher, sought review of a decision from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a trial court's decision enjoining the author and publisher from disseminating a book about plaintiff athlete and awarding damages to the athlete.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The author and the publisher attempted to disseminate a book about the athlete, a public figure. The trial court enjoined such publication and awarded damages to the athlete. The trial court order was upheld in previous appeals. The United States Supreme Court vacated the decision and ordered the matter set for reargument in light of newly decided case law. Upon reconsideration, the trial court again enjoined publication and awarded damages to the athlete. On appeal, the injunction was again affirmed. The athlete demonstrated that the author and publisher's unauthorized presentation of his life was infected with material and substantial falsification and that the book was being published with reckless disregard for the truth. The author, by his own admission, had invented dialogue, supplied imaginary incidents, and attributed thoughts and feelings to the athlete. The author had not interviewed the athlete or his teammates, but had relied solely on unverified newspaper and magazine articles for his information. The defect in the athlete's complaint was purely technical and did not warrant reversal because the author and publisher failed to allege any resulting prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Before a public figure -- in this case, a prominent professional baseball player -- may be awarded damages or an injunction against the publication of an unauthorized, fictionalized presentation of his life, he must show, in addition to the other requirements of the Civil Rights Law ( &sect;&sect; 50, 51), that the presentation is infected with material and substantial falsification and was published with knowledge of such falsification or with reckless disregard for the truth ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Time, Inc. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Hill</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 385 U.S. 374, followed).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Near a street intersection in Queens, the defendant, a 20-year-old college student, set up a 3'x3' card table, to which was pinned a sign that read: &quot;Stop the War in Viet Nam.&quot; On the table were various pamphlets containing information relating to the Vietnam situation, and the defendant requested people who stopped at the table write to their congressmen or the president protesting policies in Vietnam. The defendant was convicted of obstructing a street under &sect; 692h-1.0 and appealed. The court reversed the conviction and dismissed the charges, holding that: (1) in proscribing any obstruction &quot;whatsoever,&quot; &sect; 692h-1.0 placed on law enforcement officers the burden of determining in each case what, in their judgment, constituted an obstruction; (2) not every object on a public street necessarily obstructed it; (3) the broad prohibitive language of the statute together with the lack of any defined standards for judging violations rendered it peculiarly susceptible to arbitrary enforcement; thus, (4) &sect; 692h-1.0 was unconstitutional, particularly where it operated to restrain the exercise of First Amendment rights to free speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of perjury in the first degree, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1620, 1620-a. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) affirmed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a former police officer, was told that in order to maintain his employment he had to sign a limited waiver of immunity. Defendant signed the waiver then testified before a grand jury investigating bribery of public officials. Defendant during his testimony denied that he ever met a certain gambler or ever accepted bribes from him. Evidence was offered to the grand jury and at defendant's trial of a four-year old photograph of a man resembling defendant handing money to the gambler. The court held that a public officer could properly have been compelled to testify before a grand jury even though his testimony was the product of &quot;duress&quot; by way of the threat of removal from public office. Any waiver exerted by the duress did not prohibit defendant from exercising his right against self-incrimination. But defendant could still have been legally sworn. The perjury charges were brought well within the limitations period. The fact that the picture was of an incident four years old was only one factor for the jury to have considered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for perjury in the first degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- perjury -- police officer who signed waiver of immunity for testimony before Grand Jury under compulsion of losing his job, while immune from prosecution for substantive crime, could be sworn and could be prosecuted for perjurious testimony -- defendant was properly convicted of perjury -- record of testimony before Grand Jury established that defendant denied knowing gambler, and testimony of People's witnesses established that denials were false -- delay of four years between meeting with gambler and defendant's testimony before Grand Jury was factor considered by jurors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The signing of a waiver of immunity by a police officer who is called before a Grand Jury is done under compulsion of losing his job (New York City Charter, &sect; 1123), is void under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Garrity </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> New Jersey</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (385 U.S. 493) and is ineffective to prohibit him from claiming the privilege against self incrimination with respect to a substantive crime. However, the oath may be legally administered and he is compelled to testify. While he is immune from prosecution for substantive crimes, he may be subsequently prosecuted for perjurious testimony.  Accordingly, defendant police officer who signed a waiver of immunity and testified falsely that he did not know a named gambler was properly convicted of perjury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The record of defendant's testimony before the Grand Jury establishes that he there testified that he did not know said named gambler and did not receive anything from him.  The falsity of these denials was proved by the testimony of the People's witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The delay of more than four years between the meeting with said gambler and defendant's appearance before the Grand Jury was a factor to be considered by the jurors in determining whether defendant could not remember meeting said gambler, and they, in view of defendant's outright denials, must have found that time had not clouded defendant's memory.  </SPAN></P>

Act &sect; 466(c), which authorized the family court to enforce and modify decrees of alimony granted by foreign courts, was unconstitutional for the reason that, under the Constitution of New York, the family court had no jurisdiction to enforce or modify the support provision of a foreign divorce decree, and the legislature did not have the authority to confer such jurisdiction on the family court. The court reversed the appellate court's order. The legislature had the power under N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 7(c) to confer such jurisdiction on the family court because matrimonial actions were a &quot;new class of actions and proceedings&quot; over which the state courts had no jurisdiction under the common law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's order that reversed the family court's orders enforcing a foreign alimony decree in an action that the wife brought against the husband.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- jurisdiction -- Family Court -- Legislature had authority under State Constitution (art. VI, &sect; 7, subd. c) to confer upon Family Court power to entertain request to enforce or modify provisions of foreign matrimonial decree (cf. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Family Ct. Act, &sect; 466</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. [c]) -- proceeding to enforce and modify alimony and support provisions of foreign decrees without regard to grounds upon which decrees were granted is new class of proceeding -- under State Constitution, jurisdiction over such new class of proceeding could be given to Family Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Legislature had the authority under article VI (&sect; 7, subd. c) of the State Constitution to confer upon the Family Court the powers contained in subdivision (c) of section 466 of the Family Court Act to entertain a request to enforce or modify the provisions of a foreign matrimonial decree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 7 of article VI of the Constitution reads as follows: &quot;a. The supreme court shall have general original jurisdiction in law and equity * * * c. If the legislature shall create new classes of actions and proceedings, the supreme court shall have jurisdiction over such classes of actions and proceedings, but the legislature may provide that another court or other courts shall also have jurisdiction and that actions and proceedings of such classes may be originated in such other court or courts.&quot; The right to commence a proceeding to enforce or modify the provisions of a foreign divorce decree in the courts of this State constitutes a new class of action or proceeding.  The &quot;new classes of actions and proceedings&quot; are those which the Supreme Court would be without jurisdiction to entertain -- actions and proceedings which were unknown at common law. Prior to the enactment of section 466, the courts of this State were without jurisdiction to entertain a request to enforce or modify the provisions of a foreign matrimonial decree unless the decree was entered on grounds which were recognized in this State.  Subdivision (c) of section 466 of the Family Court Act empowered the Family Court to entertain applications to enforce and modify the alimony and support provisions of foreign decrees irrespective of the grounds upon which the decrees were granted.  Since the right to commence such proceedings was not recognized at common law and could not, therefore, have been exercised prior to the amendment of section 466, it should be viewed as a new class of proceeding.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner sought review of an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) dismissing his writ of habeas corpus and remanding him to custody.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was charged with assault and robbery of a police officer. The prisoner could not raise bail, which was set at $ 1,000. The trial court dismissed the prisoner's first writ of habeas corpus, holding that the bail was reasonable. The appellate division dismissed the prisoner's second writ of habeas corpus, holding that the lower courts had not abused their discretion in setting the bail amount. On appeal, the court affirmed.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bail -- amount of bail -- bail was properly set at $ 1,000 for relator who was arrested and charged with assault and robbery of police officer -- adoption of nonfinancially oriented system of bail is matter for Legislature, not court -- even if rules of such system were applied, relator would not be entitled to release on his own recognizance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Relator was arrested and charged with assault and robbery of a police officer. Bail was ultimately set at $ 1,000 but relator was unable to raise the bail or secure a bond for that amount.  A writ of habeas corpus was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although the present bail system may be subject to abuse, this court will not adopt a nonfinancially oriented system of bail. The adoption of such a system is more properly within the province of the Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Even if this court were to adopt a bail reform system along the lines of the Federal Bail Reform Act of 1966, the relator would still not be entitled to release on his own recognizance. The Bail Reform Act directs a Judge or Magistrate to release a defendant on his personal recognizance or upon the execution of an unsecured appearance bond if he determines that such terms will reasonably assure the defendant's presence.  In determining whether or not a defendant should be released on his own recognizance, a Judge would take into consideration the same factors which are applied in a financially oriented bail system.  Applying these criteria, the lower courts did not abuse their discretion in setting bail at $ 1,000 and in denying relator's request that he be released on his own recognizance or on $ 100 bail. The relator is accused of a vicious crime and is subject to a possible sentence of 13 years in prison.  He has been in New York for only three years.  While relator contributes to the support of his father, brother and sister, there is no evidence that they are dependent upon relator for their support.  It was well within the courts' discretion to determine that defendant's roots in the community were not strong enough to assure relator's appearance for trial if he were released on his own recognizance or on $ 100 bail. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant judge sought review of an order of respondent, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York), which removed him from office and prohibited him from thereafter holding any judicial office, appointive or elective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge was charged with advising a prostitute on a criminal prosecution pending in another court and on how she could continue to practice her trade; confining a defendant, who was not a witness when she refused to disclose information; imposing excessive bail; and bringing untoward pressure to bear upon trial counsel in abusive language. The only evidence of the consultation with the prostitute was their telephone conversations, which were intercepted under eavesdropping orders obtained to survey the prostitute's phone. Reversing the appellate court's decision, the court held that (1) the judge, as a party to the conversations, had standing to challenge the orders, and (2) the wiretaps were illegal because the orders were obtained with insufficient affidavits and thus there was no evidence to support the charge. The court concluded that although there was substantial evidence to support the other charges, they were insufficient to justify the sanction of debarment. The court noted that it was immaterial that some of the charges involved conduct that occurred while the judge was a justice of the peace because the conduct affected general character and fitness for office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order removing the judge from office and prohibiting him form holding any other judicial office and remanded the case for further proceedings on the charge involving advising a prostitute. The court ordered that if that charge was dismissed on remand, the sanction based on the remaining charges was to be reconsidered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- removal -- appeal lies to Court of Appeals from order of Appellate Division removing Judge from office -- Appellate Division has power to determine sufficiency of cause for removal -- charge that Judge, while he was Justice of Peace, advised prostitute not sustained where evidence consisted of intercepted conversations under eavesdropping orders not properly obtained -- either party on intercepted telephone line could object -- charge that Judge caused woman to be placed in jail to coerce disclosure of evidence supported by substantial evidence -- charge of imposing excessive bail properly sustained -- charge that he improperly intervened</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> in case involving traffic summons sustained -- charge that he instructed court attache to obliterate docket entries supported by evidence -- proper in this proceeding to consider his conduct prior to election to District Court -- charge that he displayed prejudice against attorneys sustained -- matter remanded to Appellate Division to consider proper disposition if first charge cannot be established by proper evidence and, if first charge survives, issues of claim of privilege against self incrimination and attorney-client privilege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An appeal lies from the order of the Appellate Division which removed appellant from his office as Suffolk County District Court Judge.  While it had been held that an appeal would not lie in such case because a removal proceeding was not a special proceeding, the statutes have been broadened to embrace within an &quot;action or special proceeding&quot; any judicial proceeding ( CPLR 103, subd. [b]; 105, subd. [d]).  The State Constitution does not contain any restrictive definition of an action or special proceeding (art.  VI, &sect; 3).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Appellate Division, which has the power of removal for cause, has the power to decide upon the sufficiency or insufficiency of a cause.  The Court of Appeals, however, may determine if there is a real or substantial cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. One of the charges sustained accused appellant of having advised and consulted with a prostitute, while he was a Justice of the Peace, on how she should conduct herself in a pending criminal prosecution against her in another court and how she could, with impunity, continue to practice her trade.  The sole source of the evidence consists of telephone conversations between appellant and the prostitute, all of which were intercepted under eavesdropping orders obtained to survey the telephone of the prostitute. The orders were not obtained in accord with the statutory requirements.  The wiretaps were illegal and the evidence not usable.  The charge is, therefore, not sustained if appellant has standing to object to the illegality of the wiretaps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Appellant was not the subscriber but he was the other conversationalist on the intercepted telephone. The test as to who should have the right to object to the interception should be the same as that in the Federal cases, which do permit either party, on the intercepted line, to object.  The charge, therefore, cannot be sustained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  There is substantial evidence to support a charge that, in an action to recover for property damage arising from an automobile collision, appellant, acting as a District Court Judge, caused a woman to be confined to a cell for a time when she refused to disclose the name of the owner of the automobile involved in the collision, seeking to coerce the disclosure from her.  It was reasonable for the Appellate Division to consider such conduct as a ground for imposing a sanction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A charge of imposing grossly excessive bail was supported by substantial evidence and properly sustained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The Appellate Division also sustained the charge which accused appellant of injecting himself improperly into the acceptance of a plea of guilty before the return day of a traffic summons, without having been assigned to the court in which the summons was returnable and without having before him the counterpart papers customary in disposing of a traffic summons. The question whether this is &quot;cause&quot; is one for the determination of the Appellate Division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. A charge that while appellant was a Justice of the Peace he had instructed a court attache to obliterate docket entries directing the entry of a default judgment against the tenant in a landlord-tenant summary proceeding, without notice to the landlord's lawyer, on a telephoned statement by the tenant's lawyer that there had been no notice of the trial date, was supported by substantial evidence and properly sustained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Other charges sustained by the Appellate Division are based on appellant's conduct as a District Court Judge in displaying overt prejudice against an attorney of record in two cases before him and in bringing untoward pressure to bear upon trial counsel in abusive and improper language.  Substantial evidence supports these charges and the Appellate Division could find them cause for the imposition of sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. It was proper in this proceeding to consider appellant's conduct prior to his election to the District Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. The matter should be remanded to the Appellate Division and, if the first charge cannot be established by proper evidence, the Appellate Division should consider the disposition to be made on the basis of the remaining charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. If the first charge survives, then the issues of the claim of privilege against self incrimination and the attorney-client privilege in connection with the first charge become material and, for the reasons stated in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Matter of Gardner </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Broderick</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (20 N Y 2d 227), the claim of privilege with regard to matters otherwise available as charges for prior misconduct while holding a judicial office might properly have been considered cause for removal by the Appellate Division.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with offenses related to bribery. The trial court entered judgment, upon a jury verdict, convicting defendant of bribery and taking unlawful fees in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 378 and 1826. On review, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department affirmed. Defendant appealed again.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a prominent political leader. In a six-count indictment he was accused of having been a party to the bribing of the former chair of the state liquor authority by the backers of a private club. The object of the bribe was to secure a restaurant liquor license. Defendant's convictions for bribery and taking unlawful fees were predicated upon his aiding and abetting in the commission of those acts. After the appellate division affirmed the judgment of conviction, defendant again sought review asserting multiple errors. On review, the court held defendant's guilt as an aider and abettor was proved beyond a reasonable doubt, with sufficient corroboration of the testimony of his three accomplices. However, the court found, and the prosecution conceded, that defendant was entitled to a full evidentiary hearing on the question of whether court orders authorizing certain eavesdrops were properly issued and executed. In addition, the court directed, if there were improper eavesdrops, it was necessary to determine whether the prosecution's evidence at defendant's trial was tainted by such improper eavesdropping.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction was affirmed as modified, with a remand for a full hearing as to any claimed violations of defendant's rights through eavesdrops.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- bribery -- taking unlawful fees -- evidence sufficient for jury to find defendant guilty of bribery and taking unlawful fees where he allegedly aided and abetted in commission of those crimes -- accomplice testimony sufficiently corroborated -- defendant cannot challenge eavesdroppings where his own privacy not invaded but may object to eavesdropping on telephone in his own office -- defendant entitled to hearing on question whether eavesdrops were properly authorized -- decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Berger v. New York (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">388 U.S. 41)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> not to be given retroactive</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> application -- more complete record required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was convicted of the crimes of bribery (former Penal Law, &sect; 378) and taking unlawful fees (former Penal Law, &sect; 1826), predicated upon his allegedly having aided and abetted in the commission of those crimes (see former Penal Law, &sect; 2).  He was accused of having been a party to the bribing of the former Chairman of the State Liquor Authority by the backers of the New York Playboy Club to secure a restaurant liquor license. The evidence was sufficient for the jury to find him guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The accomplice testimony given in evidence against defendant was sufficiently corroborated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Certain eavesdroppings conducted by the prosecution under court orders issued pursuant to section 813-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as to which defendant conceded his own privacy was not invaded, cannot be challenged by defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Defendant's own business office was bugged and phone calls, to which he was a party, were tapped.  Defendant has standing to object to this eavesdropping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Defendant is entitled to a full evidentiary hearing on the question whether the court orders authorizing these eavesdrops were properly issued and executed.  Further, if there were improper eavesdrops, it must be determined whether the People's evidence on defendant's trial was &quot;tainted&quot; by such improper eavesdropping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. On remand, however, the decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Berger </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> New York</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (388 U.S. 41), which declared section 813-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure unconstitutional, is not to be given retroactive application.  Therefore, section 813-a is applicable to this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. On remand, the trial court must also consider defendant's claim that the prosecution, in failing to disclose additional eavesdrops, wrongfully suppressed evidence that might have helped the defendant and his claim that the prosecution, by means of this eavesdropping, interfered with his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel.  A reversal of the conviction is not required.  A remand for a full hearing on these questions is sufficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. A more complete record should be made also on the prosecution's conduct in maintaining an electronic surveillance of defendant's office after the defendant had become a suspect in the investigation and after the prosecution had learned that he was accustomed to conferring with his then attorney at this office.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), affirmed a judgment of the county court rendered upon a verdict convicting defendant of coercion, attempted extortion, and conspiracy to commit extortion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of coercion, attempted extortion, and conspiracy to commit extortion. His conviction was based substantially on evidence procured through a wiretap. On appeal, he contended that a decision by the United States Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional on its face the statute that authorized the wiretap order and therefore the evidence seized pursuant to that order was erroneously admitted. The court concluded that the Supreme Court decision did not affect the wiretapping provisions of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 813-a. The decision affected only the language that permitted a trespassory invasion of the home, by general warrant, contrary to the Fourth Amendment. The court also declined to hold that wiretap evidence obtained in substantial compliance with the strictest provisions of the United States and New York Constitutions must be excluded in criminal prosecutions in New York. Therefore, defendant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the appellate court that affirmed the county court's conviction of defendant. The wiretap order used to procure evidence used in aid of defendant's conviction was in substantial compliance with the strictest provisions of the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Court of Appeals has held that the expressions &quot;oath or affirmation&quot; and &quot;reasonable grounds to believe&quot; contained in the statute require the same factual basis to be shown for the issuance of the eavesdropping order as in the case of search warrants, and applied the same constitutional standards governing ordinary searches to eavesdropping cases.  The procedure of antecedent justification before a Magistrate was required and no wiretap or bugging order could issue except upon an adequate factual showing -- probable cause to believe that a crime had been committed and that the conversations particularized in the order would be seized. The order here in question complied with this requirement as with all the requirements of the statute.  Although there were certain defects,  as the opinion in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Berger</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case indicates, the reason for the defects was that there had been no previous decision outlining the necessity for those requirements which the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Berger</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case found to be mandatory.  Assuming that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Berger</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case brought wiretapping within the purview of the Fourth Amendment, a reversal of the conviction would not be warranted either under the decisions of the Court of Appeals or of the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Berger</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision is applicable only to those cases in which the orders were issued or eavesdropping took place after the date of that decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Supreme Court did not state that wiretapping as well as bugging constitutes a violation of the Fourth Amendment and it failed to overrule </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Olmstead </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> United States</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (277 U.S. 438), which held that wiretapping accomplished without a trespass into the person's home or other premises does not violate the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. The wiretapping provisions of section 813-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure were not affected by the decision in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Berger</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case.  What was affected was only that language which would permit a trespassory invasion of the home, by general warrant, contrary to the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Although the evidence was obtained in violation of section 605 of the Federal Communications Act and such wiretap evidence is inadmissible in Federal prosecutions, the States are not required to exclude such evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In conformity with the traditional policy to construe statutes in such manner as to uphold their constitutionality, and in conformity with the specific policy of construing section 813-a so as to provide the same protections as are afforded by the Fourth Amendment, the Court of Appeals holds that, in addition to a showing of probable cause, an order issued under the statute must particularize to the extent possible the exact nature of the conversations sought, that it must provide for a return, that it must be severely limited in time, as outlined in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Berger</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opinion, and that it must provide for termination as soon as the conversations are seized. In addition, it should allege that exigent circumstances exist, viz., that the &quot;destruction&quot; of the object of the &quot;search&quot; will result unless the notice requirement is waived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. This rehabilitation of the statute is possible even though the Supreme Court struck the statute down on its face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. In the case at bar no special proceeding to obtain a limiting construction of the statute is necessary before it is applied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The restaurant owner's retail liquor license was annulled by the authority on a charge that it suffered or permitted the licensed premises to become disorderly in that it permitted homosexuals, degenerates, and undesirables to be and remain on the licensed premises and conduct themselves in an offensive and indecent manner contrary to good morals. The court reversed the appellate court's decision and annulled the authority's determination. There was no proof of any breach of the peace. There was no evidence to attribute to the restaurant owner knowledge that a police officer had been solicited by a customer for homosexual purposes and the proof of the transaction should have been eliminated from consideration as offering any support of the finding of disorder. The solicitation was an essential basis of the authority's decision to sustain the charge. Indulgence in the inference that certain men in a grill containing 40 people were, from their dress and makeup, homosexuals did not support the additional inference that they would have created disorder. It was reasonable to think that a homosexual might be orderly in the sense in which the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law defined order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed the judgment of the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court (New York), which affirmed their conviction for failing to contribute to welfare funds in violation of former N.Y. Penal Law. &sect; 962-a (now N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 198-c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a corporation and its president, were convicted of failing to contribute to welfare funds in violation of &sect; 962-a. The appellate court affirmed. Defendants appealed. The court affirmed because the evidence was sufficient to establish that the corporation did not pay moneys due the union pension and welfare funds under a collective bargaining agreement and that the president's position was such that he knew or should have known of the nonpayment. The court held that the fact that &sect; 962-a gave the victim a civil remedy did not deprive the legislature of its power to prescribe criminal penalties for employers who wrongfully withheld benefits. The court found that the president, as the only active officer and principal shareholder, was intimately involved with the corporation's affairs and could not have been exculpated as a nominal officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendants' convictions for failing to contribute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- failure to pay money to union pension and welfare funds -- section 962-a of former Penal Law (now </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labor Law, &sect; 198-c</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">), which provided that employer which fails to pay amounts due under agreement to pay or provide benefits or wage supplements shall be guilty of misdemeanor, is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- evidence sustains charge of failure of corporation to pay moneys due union pension and welfare funds -- Legislature had right to place responsibility of enforcing compliance with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> on &quot;president, secretary, treasurer or officers exercising corresponding functions&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 962-a of the former Penal Law (now Labor Law, &sect; 198-c) provided that &quot;any employer who is party to an agreement to pay or provide benefits, or wage supplements as defined in section two hundred twenty of the labor law, and who fails, neglects or refuses to pay the amount or amounts necessary to provide such benefits or furnish such supplements within thirty days after such payments are required to be made, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor * * *.  Where such employer is a corporation, the president, secretary, treasurer or officers exercising corresponding functions shall each be guilty of a misdemeanor.&quot; The statute is not unconstitutional and the evidence sustains the charge of nonpayment by the corporation of moneys which were due certain union pension and welfare funds under a collective bargaining agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The purpose of the statute was not to give a favored group of persons the right to enforce criminally a purely civil obligation.  It is designed to protect the rights of a group of persons, who have long been recognized to be proper objects of legislative concern, by providing criminal sanctions against those employers who wrongfully withhold benefits which the employees have earned and to which they are entitled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Legislature had the right to place upon &quot;the president, secretary, treasurer or officers exercising corresponding functions&quot; the responsibility of enforcing compliance with the statute.  If the officer is prevented by corporate management from complying with the statute, he may acquiesce and face the possibility of criminal prosecution or he can disobey and perhaps sacrifice his position.  The choice may be a difficult one but that can have no bearing on the power of the Legislature to define criminal responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The same standards apply to a prosecution under section 962-a as applied under section 1272 of the former Penal Law. An officer may not be convicted of violating the statute unless he stood in such a relation to the corporate affairs that it may be presumed that he knew of or should have known of the nonpayment and should have taken some steps to prevent the nonpayment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In any event the evidence indicates beyond any reasonable doubt that the defendant, who was apparently the only active officer as well as the principal shareholder of the corporation, was intimately involved in the affairs of the corporation and he knew or should have known of the nonpayment. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorneys argued that their suspensions were unconstitutional because the charges that led to their suspension were based upon information supplied by the attorneys. At the time, the law in New York allowed an attorney to be disbarred for refusing to testify in a disciplinary proceeding. That law was subsequently declared unconstitutional. In essence, the attorneys claimed that they were unconstitutionally coerced to testify against themselves. The court affirmed the decision of the lower court and found that although the attorneys could not be prosecuted criminally for any statements made in their disciplinary proceedings, nor could they have been disbarred had they refused to testify, the attorneys had no privilege against making disclosure usable only in a disciplinary proceeding. The protections afforded by the Fifth Amendment related only to self-incrimination on charges of crime. The attorneys' disciplinary proceedings for professional misconduct were civil in nature. The attorneys had no constitutional privilege to withhold evidence that could not lead to criminal prosecution and bore only upon their right to continue to practice law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attorney and client -- disciplinary proceedings -- suspended attorneys contend that charges sustained against them were based upon disclosures made by them because assertion of their privilege against self incrimination would, at time they were made, have resulted in their disbarment, and that sustaining of charges on basis of such disclosures was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> in light of two recent decisions of United States Supreme Court -- while it might be that, under said decisions, disclosures would have to have been excluded from evidence in any subsequent criminal prosecution against them, and that they could not have been disciplined for having invoked privilege against self</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> incrimination instead of making disclosures, neither of these things occurred -- they did make disclosures and it is sufficient protection that they cannot be prosecuted criminally on basis of them -- neither Supreme Court decision cited confers constitutional privilege against use of disclosures in disciplinary proceedings, which are civil in nature -- to determine motivation of attorney who chooses to make disclosures as to his professional conduct would be speculative inquiry, not resolvable as question of fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In the case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Spevack </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Klein</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (385 U.S. 511, decided Jan.  16, 1967), the United States Supreme Court expressly overruled an earlier decision made by it in the case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Cohen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Hurley</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (366 U.S. 117, decided April 24, 1961) and held that an attorney could not be disbarred for asserting his privilege against self incrimination when being questioned concerning his professional conduct. At the same time it also held, in the case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Garrity </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> New Jersey</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (385 U.S. 493), that the existence of a statute which provided for the removal of a public employee who invoked the Fifth Amendment in official inquiries had coerced certain police officers into failing to invoke said amendment and that, therefore, their statements should not have been admitted into evidence against them in a criminal prosecution. Subsequent to these decisions in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Spevack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Garrity</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cases, the United States Supreme Court vacated a 1965 order of the Appellate Division which had ordered the disbarment of one attorney and the suspension of the other attorney in the present disciplinary proceedings and remanded the proceedings &quot;in the light of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Spevack </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Klein</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;.  On reconsideration following the remand, the Appellate Division sustained three charges as to both attorneys.  They now contend that these three charges were based, at least in part, upon disclosures which were made by them because assertion of their privilege against self incrimination with respect to the disclosures would have resulted in their disbarment while </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Cohen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Hurley</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remained the law, and that sustaining those charges on the basis of such disclosures was unconstitutional in the light of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Spevack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Garrity</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cases.  However, while it might be that, under the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Garrity</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case, the disclosures made by them in the disciplinary proceedings would have to have been excluded from evidence in any subsequent criminal prosecution, and that, under the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Spevack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case, they could not have been disciplined for invoking their privilege against self incrimination instead of making the disclosures, neither of these things occurred.  Here, appellants did make the disclosures which contributed to the punishment imposed upon them and it is sufficient protection that they cannot be prosecuted criminally on the basis of them.  Neither the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Garrity</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nor the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Spevack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case confers a constitutional privilege against the use of such disclosures in disciplinary proceedings, which are civil in nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Appellants may have made the disclosures because they thought they would be disbarred if they invoked their privileges, but to determine the motivation of an attorney who chooses to make disclosures as to his professional conduct would be a speculative inquiry, not resolvable as a question of fact. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County (New York), which was entered in defendant's second trial on the jury's verdict that convicted defendant of felony murder and sentenced him to death. The second trial resulted from the United States Supreme Court's decision that required the state to either accord defendant a hearing on the voluntariness of a confession introduced at his first trial, a new trial, or a release.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The underlying felony committed by defendant was robbery of a hotel. As defendant emerged from the hotel, he encountered a patrolman whom he shot and killed. At the sentencing stage of defendant's trial, the state introduced testimony from a police officer who overheard defendant confess to a series of unrelated robberies and burglaries. The court held that the conviction and sentence were proper and that defendant was not twice put in jeopardy for felony murder because the jury in defendant's first trial was not given a full opportunity to return a verdict on the felony murder offense and the jury's silence as to that offense did not constitute an acquittal. The trial court's failure to properly instruct the jury on the termination of the felony was harmless error. Defendant was not entitled to a &quot;Huntley hearing&quot; prior to the introduction of the confessions at the sentencing stage because he did not object to their admission on the ground that they were involuntary and he made no showing that the confessions were coerced. Defendant's trial before a special, or &quot;blue ribbon,&quot; jury did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- murder -- first degree -- under indictment for murder in first degree, defendant was properly convicted at first trial of common-law first degree murder and, at second trial, of felony murder; no double jeopardy -- felony (robbery) had not yet terminated when defendant encountered and killed policeman; trial court's alleged error in answer to jury's request for further instructions on this point did not amount to reversible error -- jury properly decreed death penalty, after post-verdict hearing (Penal Law, &sect; 1045-a) in which evidence of defendant's confession was introduced -- defendant did not offer any evidence that that confession was involuntary; defendant was not automatically entitled to preliminary trial by court of voluntariness of such confession -- trial by &quot;blue ribbon&quot; jury did not violate defendant's rights to equal protection of laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Under an indictment charging defendant with the crime of murder in the first degree, the jury was instructed at defendant's first trial in 1960, without any exception taken, to render a verdict on one but not on both of the theories of first degree murder which the evidence supported -- either a premeditated homicide or a homicide committed while engaged in the commission of a felony (Penal Law, &sect; 1044, subds. 1, 2).  The jury returned a verdict of common-law first degree murder, and accordingly defendant was sentenced to death; but, on appeal, a new trial was ordered.  This did not unconstitutionally subject him to double jeopardy after an acquittal (U. S. Const., 5th Amdt.; N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 6).  The defendant was not indicted or tried for two crimes, and was not acquitted of a crime by the jury's silence as to one of the theories of proof.  Accordingly, on the retrial, in 1965, under the original indictment, evidence was properly received and the jury was properly instructed as to both of said theories of proof, and the jury properly found defendant guilty of murder in the first degree on the theory of felony murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The evidence proved that defendant robbed a hotel clerk at gunpoint and, emerging from the hotel doorway,  encountered a policeman and killed the policeman in an exchange of gunfire.  No jury could rationally have found that the defendant had already abandoned or terminated this robbery. Accordingly, the alleged error in the trial court's answer to the jury's request for further instructions as to what constitutes the termination of a felony did not seriously prejudice the defendant's rights (Code Crim.  Pro., &sect;&sect; 427, 542).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. After being thus properly convicted of first degree murder, the defendant was given a hearing before the trial jury to determine whether he would suffer the penalty of death or life imprisonment (Penal Law, &sect; 1045-a).  Subdivision 3 of said statute provides as follows, as to such a hearing: &quot;evidence may be presented by either party on any matter relevant to sentence including, but not limited to, the nature and circumstances of the crime, defendant's background and history, and any aggravating or mitigating circumstances.  Any relevant evidence, not legally privileged, shall be received regardless of its admissibility under the exclusionary rules of evidence.&quot; The trial court properly rejected defendant's objections that the District Attorney had not notified defendant in advance of his intention to introduce a confession, and that the defendant was automatically entitled as a matter of due process to a preliminary trial by the court alone as to the voluntariness of the confession. The defendant did not allege or come forward with any evidence that the confession was involuntary. In the sentencing stage of a trial (under Penal Law, &sect; 1045-a) the defendant is not automatically entitled to a hearing on voluntariness. The trial court made no finding as to voluntariness and did not submit such question to the jury.  The jury decreed the death penalty.  The judgment is affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Defendant's trial before a special so-called &quot;blue ribbon&quot; jury (Judiciary Law, &sect; 749-aa) did not violate defendant's constitutional rights to the equal protection of the laws.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner condemnor brought an action seeking to condemn property of respondent condemnee. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) modified, on the law and the facts, and, as modified, affirmed the order condemning the property and awarding the condemnee just compensation and interest. Both parties sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The condemned property was an interurban electric railroad system. The legislatures of both the states of New York and New Jersey determined that the continued operation of the facility could only be continued under public ownership. Therefore, pursuant to bi-State legislation, 1962 N.J. Laws ch. 8, the condemnor condemned the property. The issue before the court was what constituted just compensation to the owner and operator of an essential public facility when its property was condemned for continued dedication to the same use to which the owner had dedicated the property. The court noted that while the general rule was that the condemnee be paid the fair market value of the property, there were instances when that rule was unjust. The court found that this was such an instance. The court determined that an award of scrap value solely on the basis of the unprofitability of the enterprise was arbitrary. The court found that the award of interest was intended to compensate the condemnee for the delay in his receipt of the just compensation award and that it was inequitable to penalize the condemnee by denying him interest when he was protecting his rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part, modified in part, and remanded in part the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent domain -- compensation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- depreciated original cost, rather than present market or scrap value, is proper award for tunnels of railroad, which public corporation will operate -- but award for cars, tracks, repair shops, equipment, etc., remanded to Special Term to consider obsolescence, cost of rehabilitation, and present unprofitability of operation -- going concern valuation, if any, must be based on evidence -- New York </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> limiting interest on award for properties in New York to 4% per annum, constitutional -- bi-State </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">legislation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> requires that New Jersey law apply to this railroad's properties in New Jersey; 6% interest on portion of award made for properties in New Jersey, fair and proper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Normally, fair market value constitutes &quot;just compensation&quot;, but not when this would work a manifest injustice to the owner or to the public.  Here, a commuter railroad, running mostly through underground tunnels and tunnels under the Hudson River, which tunnels cost some $ 32,000,000 to construct and which would cost over $ 400,000,000 to reproduce today, has been appropriated by a public corporation for the same continued uses by the public.  With some relatively minor expenditures, the tunnels will serve for an indefinite period.  Special Term properly evaluated the tunnels at their depreciated original cost, $ 30,000,000.  The Appellate Division erred in reducing this amount to liquidation value or scrap value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The non-tunnel properties consist of passenger cars, tracks, roadbed, repair shops, signal and electrical and compressed air systems, equipment, etc.  Some of the passenger cars were recently purchased; but most of these non-tunnel properties are severely deteriorated and it appears that an expenditure of almost $ 32,000,000 would be needed to rehabilitate them.  Although the Appellate Division erred in awarding salvage or scrap value solely on the basis of the unprofitability of the enterprise, Special Term erred in evaluating these properties at $ 20,000,000.  This portion of the award is remanded to Special Term, for consideration of the physical and technological obsolescence of these properties, and the expenditures required to rehabilitate these properties, and the present unprofitability of this business enterprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Special Term erroneously added, to its total award of $ 50,000,000 for the railroad, 10% or $ 5,000,000 for the going concern value. This,  too, is remanded to Special Term for further determination.  A finding of going concern value must be based on evidence of the cost of organizing and systematizing an enterprise, such as the cost of development of operating schedules and records and procedures and training personnel; and unprofitability must be considered to the extent that it evidences an inefficient organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The New York statute limiting interest on the amount of the award for the properties located in New York to 4% per annum from the date of the appropriation is valid under both the New York and Federal Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The bi-State legislation authorizing this appropriation requires that New Jersey law shall apply to the portion of this property located in New Jersey.  New Jersey has no statute governing the rate of interest on the award.  The parties have stipulated that the properties which are located in New Jersey comprise 65% of the total value.  Special Term properly awarded interest at 6% on this 65% portion of the award.  This rate is fair and proper under New Jersey law.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation leased various properties adjacent to the thruway for the purpose of constructing and maintaining advertising signs. The signs were more that 500 feet distant from the nearest edge of the pavement, but due to amendments to N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 361-a that changed the distances, the signs were within the forbidden area. The signs were removed by the thruway authority and the corporation filed its notice of intention one day beyond the 90 days limited by N.Y. Ct. Cl. Act &sect; 10(3). The corporation sought permission to extend the time pursuant to N.Y. Ct. Cl. Act &sect; (10)(5). The appellate division denied the corporation's motion to file a late notice of claim and granted the state's motion to dismiss the claim. The court rejected the corporation's argument that &sect; 361-a was an unconstitutional exercise of the police power and constituted a taking of private property without just compensation because it authorized the removal or destruction of the signs. On review the court held that the reason for the statute was to provide safety to the motorists and there was no doubt about the power of the legislature to require the removal.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court that it had to reconsider the prior precedent, reversed and granted the declaratory judgment. The court stated that the ownership of land as a prerequisite to holding an elective town office constituted an invidious discrimination against nonlandowners. The court stated that it was a sort of economic gerrymandering which ran afoul of the equal protection clauses of both state and federal constitutions.

The statutory purpose is to prevent a breach of the peace -- to prevent the outbreak of violence by discouraging contemptuous and insulting treatment of the flag in public.  The State may legitimately curb such activities in the interest of preventing violence and maintaining public order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since the act in question was specifically prohibited by a statute ( Penal Law, &sect; 1425, subd. 6) and the defendant could be punished only once for having engaged in such conduct ( Penal Law, &sect; 1938), the court did not render an inconsistent verdict when it dismissed the more general charge of disorderly conduct. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant counties challenged two orders of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, Third Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed rulings in favor of respondents, residents, taxpayers, and property owners, and invalidated as unconstitutional two plans of permanent apportionment through weighted voting by the counties' boards of supervisors (boards) and ordered the counties to provide new plans.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. County Law &sect; 150 provided that the supervisors of each county's municipalities were each county's board; under the plans, the supervisors of larger municipalities would be able to cast more votes up to a maximum, based upon population. On review, the court found that equal representation on the boards of municipalities of varying populations did not satisfy the &quot;one person, one vote&quot; principle, that &sect; 150 as applied to the counties violated constitutional requirements, and that there was nothing unconstitutional in a disparity of influence among the members of the boards. The court found that the proposed modified weighted voting schemes were not supported by sufficient mathematical evidence and computer analyses giving proof that the plans were not defective, and that the court below had correctly determined that the plans were invalid. The court modified the orders to provide that the boards adopt and submit constitutionally valid plans of reapportionment within 60 days and affirmed the orders as modified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the orders and ordered the boards to submit plans of reapportionment within 60 days. The court then affirmed the orders.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- apportionment of Boards of Supervisors -- &quot;adjusted weighted&quot; and &quot;fractional weighted&quot; voting plans to correct malapportionment of Boards of Supervisors of Washington and Saratoga Counties are </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">sections 150 and 153 (subd. 4) of County Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> are </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Boards of Supervisors directed to reapportion themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. &quot;Adjusted weighted voting&quot; and &quot;fractional weighted voting&quot; plans to correct malapportionments of the Boards of Supervisors of Washington and Saratoga Counties are constitutionally invalid. Such plans violate the principle of one man-one vote where the power of a representative to affect the passage of legislation by his vote does not roughly correspond to the proportion of the population in his constituency. A legislator's voting power, measured by the mathematical possibility of his casting a decisive vote, must approximate the power he would have in a legislative body which did not employ weighted voting. Since it is not readily apparent on its face whether either of the plans meets the constitutional standards, the plans are of doubtful validity, and to establish the facts one way or another would, in all likelihood, be most expensive. It was incumbent on the boards to come forward with the requisite proof that the plans are not defective.  Since this was not done, the courts below correctly determined that the plans are invalid. The only issue involved is the factual one pertaining to the mathematics of the plans.  The boards adopted them without obtaining the expensive mathematical analyses that would establish the facts.  Under these circumstances, the boards are not entitled to rely on a presumption that their legislative acts are constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 150 of the County Law provides that the supervisors of the several cities and towns in each county &quot;shall constitute the board of supervisors of the county&quot; and subdivision 4 of section 153 provides that the board shall conduct its business &quot;by the affirmative vote of a majority of [its] total membership&quot;.  Such sections, which make no provision for population differences, are unconstitutional as applied to Washington and Saratoga Counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In the absence of a valid statute establishing the organization and composition of the Boards of Supervisors of those counties, the boards should be directed to reapportion themselves in accordance with the powers granted to them by the Municipal Home Rule Law ( &sect; 10, subd. 1, par.  [ii], cl. a, subcl. [1]).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff individual appealed the order of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which denied his motion for summary judgment in his declaratory action seeking to strike as unconstitutional New York's vagrancy statute, N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect;887(1). The individual had been arrested and acquitted under the statute and had applied for, and been denied, a prohibition barring the court from hearing further vagrancy cases against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual applied to the federal court for a declaration of the unconstitutionality of &sect; 887(1), but was denied because he had a state remedy. The trial court denied his summary judgment motion in his declaratory action. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that &sect; 887(1) was unconstitutional because it violated due process and constituted an overreaching of the state's police power. The court noted that the statute was a &quot;status crime&quot; in that it looked at a person's condition or being rather than a person's actions. Status crime statutes cannot stand if they make criminal a condition over which a person has no control or if the conditions are vaguely defined, but since the vagrancy statute was not attacked as void for vagueness, the court did not reach the question of its vagueness. The court found that the statute was not a valid exercise of police power since its only purpose was to arrest and prosecute for vagrancy persons whose only crime, in any, was against themselves.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's denial of the individual's motion for summary judgment in his declaratory action to have the vagrancy statute declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On three occasions, each about a month apart, plaintiff was arrested and charged with violation of subdivision 1 of section 887 of the Code of Criminal Procedure with being &quot;a person who, not having visible means to maintain himself, lives without employment.&quot; Following each arrest he was acquitted of the violation charged.  In this action for a declaratory judgment he is entitled to judgment declaring the statute unconstitutional.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The statute is unconstitutional in that it violates due process and constitutes an overreaching of the proper limitations of the police power in that it unreasonably makes criminal and provides punishment for conduct of an individual which in no way impinges on the rights or interests of others and which has in no way been demonstrated to have anything more than the most tenuous connection with prevention of crime and preservation of the public order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Plaintiff's appeal is properly taken to the Court of Appeals directly from the Supreme Court since the sole question raised and decided below and the sole issue on the appeal is the constitutionality of the statute.  Declaratory relief of the kind here sought is available under the circumstances.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a determination adjudging defendant to be a youthful offender on his plea of guilty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for possession of a pistol by a detective who had been alerted by an anonymous telephone call. A motion to suppress the evidence was denied after a hearing. Defendant pleaded guilty and was adjudged a youthful offender. The appellate court affirmed the conviction. On further appeal, the court affirmed. The search was valid under the &quot;Stop and Frisk&quot; amendment to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 180-a. The detective had at least a reasonably based suspicion that defendant was committing a crime and was thus entitled to &quot;stop&quot; him. The detective was also warranted in suspecting that defendant possessed a dangerous weapon that threatened the life of the detective as well as others in the immediate vicinity. The detective had a reasonably based suspicion not only that defendant was carrying a pistol but also that the weapon was located in his left-hand jacket pocket. It would be unreasonable to require an officer in that situation to engage in a preparatory and undoubtedly dangerous frisk, particularly in view of the fact that defendant was standing in the middle of a group of children at the time of the search.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment that affirmed a determination adjudging defendant to be a youthful offender on his plea of guilty.</SPAN></P>

Pro., &sect; 180-a) -- motion to suppress such seized evidence was properly denied and youth was properly adjudged to be youthful offender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An anonymous person telephoned the police and said that, on a certain street corner, a blond, blue-eyed male about 18 years old, who was wearing white chino-type trousers, had a loaded .32-calibre revolver in his left-hand jacket pocket. The caller remained unidentified and hence the police could not ascertain his reliability.  A detective was dispatched to the street corner.  There he saw a youth who matched the telephoned description.  The youth was standing in the midst of a group of children.  This was an exigency which required immediate police action. The safety of the officer and the children would not allow any preliminary questioning or frisking.  The detective seized the youth by the arm and placed him against the wall of a building and took the revolver out of his left-hand jacket pocket, which was inside the jacket lining and did not noticeably bulge.  This was a case where, as set forth in the Code of Criminal Procedure (&sect; 180-a), a police officer &quot;reasonably suspects&quot; that a person in a public place &quot;is committing&quot; a crime and that he, the police officer, &quot;is in danger of life or limb&quot;, in which case, &quot;he may search such person for a dangerous weapon&quot; and, if he &quot;finds such a weapon * * * he may take * * * it&quot; and &quot;arrest such person.&quot; Subsequently, after a hearing, a motion by the arrested youth to suppress such seized evidence was properly denied, and thereafter he was adjudged a youthful offender on his plea of guilty and was committed to the Elmira Reception Center; and such judgment of the New York City Criminal Court was properly affirmed by the Appellate Term.  </SPAN></P>

Also involved were two pistols obtained as incident to arrests made on the basis of information obtained under the eavesdropping order. The trial court had not only granted the motions to suppress but as a further consequence of the suppression dismissed the indictment. The State sought review and the appellate division reversed. On appeal, the court found that the Supreme Court of the United States held the &sect; 813-a was unconstitutional. The court held that consequently, it was constrained to hold that the evidence obtained in the case, as well as the &quot;fruits&quot; of such evidence, was illegally obtained and must be suppressed, despite the fact that the police officers acted in good faith.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was the exclusive distributor of two brands of liquor. Defendant was a retailer. The trial court entered an injunction, pursuant to the Feld-Crawford Act, N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 369-a et seq., prohibiting the retailing by defendants of those branded liquors at less than the prices fixed by the distiller or plaintiff as its distributor. The lower appellate court had affirmed the judgment but modified it to eliminate the award of damages, and both parties appealed. The court reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings in accordance with its opinion. The issue presented was whether new liquor legislation, 1964 N.Y. Laws 531, prohibited agreements fixing retail prices. The court held that such agreements were possible, but that the proponent of such an agreement would have the burden of establishing that consumers would benefit from a reduction in wholesale prices. The court noted also that the law was not enacted to enrich wholesalers or retailers and that any party seeking an injunction would be required to show that they had equitable standing to obtain affirmative equitable relief.</SPAN></P>

The prices to be fixed by liquor injunctions against the retailer cannot be set at higher figures than those which would result in the normal course of business from the application of the price reduction provisions of chapters 531 and 798.  The burden of showing the extent to which reductions in consumer prices would reflect the reductions in prices to wholesalers and retailers rests upon plaintiff in an action for a Feld-Crawford injunction. The matter is remitted to Special Term.  If the prices sought to be enforced by this injunction are the same as they were under the now repealed mandatory price-fixing by the State Liquor Authority, an injunction may not issue and the complaint should be dismissed.  Upon the other hand, if the prices fixed by this Feld-Crawford agreement do, approximately, reflect the reduction in retail prices which would result in the normal course of business from the statutorily mandated reductions in the case of sales to wholesalers and to retailers, then an injunction may issue.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney was convicted of felony charges. After the attorney's conviction was reversed, respondent bar association began proceedings to strike his name from the roll of attorneys, after which the attorney filed a motion for reinstatement to the bar. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) denied his motion for reinstatement. The attorney appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his conviction in a federal court, the attorney was automatically disbarred under N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 90. Before his name was stricken from the rolls, the federal court reversed the attorney's conviction and ordered a new trial. The court stated that in Matter of Ginsberg, 1 N.Y.2d 144, 134 N.E.2d 193 (1956) it had been held that when a lawyer asked for reinstatement, the appellate division could consider all of the circumstances of the alleged criminal conduct to see if there was convincing proof of innocence. The court held that this rule was unjust when applied to reversals of convictions. It stated that because a reversal nullified the conviction, a lawyer who had been disbarred for a felony conviction and sought reinstatement was entitled either to prompt reinstatement or to the institution of proceedings to preclude him from reinstatement on the basis of charges and proof sufficient to debar him. It overruled the Ginsberg case to the extent that it conflicted with this holding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate division's order denying the motion for reinstatement. It remanded the case for such proceedings as might be appropriate and consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attorney and client -- disciplinary proceedings -- felony -- reversal -- when felony conviction for which lawyer's name was stricken from roll of attorneys is reversed, his application for reinstatement should be granted by Appellate Division, unless disciplinary proceedings on specific charges of misconduct are promptly instituted, or unless circumstances show danger to well-being of clients or public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a lawyer is convicted of a felony, he is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">ipso facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> disbarred. Such fact may be recorded, as in this case, by an Appellate Division order striking his name from the roll of attorneys (Judiciary Law, &sect; 90, subd.  4).  But, if the judgment of conviction is reversed -- as in this instance, where the United States Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the United States District Court for errors in the trial and ordered a new trial -- the judgment of conviction no longer exists.  In such situation, the petitioning Bar Association or the Appellate Division may promptly institute proceedings to discipline the lawyer for the misconduct involved in the criminal prosecution or for any other matters meriting discipline, before he is entitled to resume the practice of law. Any proceedings thus brought on charges will be subject to the usual rules as to specificity of charges and burden of proof. If for any reason it is not desired to proceed in this fashion, especially if out of a sense of fairness or otherwise the Bar Association or the Appellate Division prefers to have the criminal prosecution follow its normal course before the institution of disciplinary proceedings, then the lawyer should be promptly reinstated if he applies for reinstatement. He does not have the burden of proving his innocence.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Matter of Ginsberg</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 1 N Y 2d 144, limited.) However, if the judgment of conviction arose out of a pattern of misconduct which directly affects the well-being of clients or public, or if there are other circumstances requiring the protection of clients or public, the Appellate Division has discretion under the statute (Judiciary Law, &sect; 90, subd. 5) to take appropriate preventive steps.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Supreme Court in Queens County (New York), which convicted him of murder in the first degree and, in a separate jury proceeding pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1045-a, sentenced him to death. Defendant challenged the trial court's refusal to allow mitigating evidence at the sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant confessed to killing, robbing, and attempting to rape a woman. He was charged with murder in the first degree, and the only defense was insanity. The jury found him sane, convicted him, and recommended the death penalty, which was imposed. Defendant appealed, claiming that the trial court erred in refusing to admit mitigating evidence at the sentencing hearing. The court held that: (1) admission of testimony that defendant was incapable of self-control was admissible at the sentencing hearing and was not a relitigation of the sanity question because he was entitled to persuade the jury that, while legally sane, his mental condition should have been considered in mitigation; (2) the issue at the sentencing hearing was not defendant's guilt but whether he deserved mercy; and (3) under the circumstances, N.Y. Penal Law. &sect; 1045-a mandated a sentence of life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's judgment of conviction was reversed to the extent that the sentence of death was set aside and the case was remanded for imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was found guilty of murder in the first degree and the death penalty was imposed upon a recommendation of the jury in a separate sentencing proceeding pursuant to section 1045-a of the Penal Law. His only defense at the trial was insanity. With respect to that issue, the jury was properly charged and the People proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knew it was wrong to kill decedent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The trial court, however, committed substantial error in holding that evidence as to defendant's mental condition was not admissible at the sentencing hearing. Defendant was not attempting to relitigate the issue of his legal insanity or his criminal responsibility. He was endeavoring to persuade the jury that, while &quot;legally sane&quot;, his mental illness may have rendered it impossible for him to exercise any self-control, and should, therefore, be considered in mitigation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff boards of education appealed an order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which reversed a judgment that declared N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The boards of education sought a judgment that declared that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 701(2) violated both N.Y. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3 and U.S. Const. amends. I, IV. The Commissioner of Education alleged that the complaint failed to state a cause of action and that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 701(2) was constitutional. The lower court indicated that the boards of education had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 701(2). The court reviewed the merits of the case. The court found that in providing textbooks to students of both public and private schools, there was no intention to assist parochial schools. The court determined that any benefit accruing to parochial schools in receiving textbooks for its students was a collateral effect of N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 701(2), so it could not be classified as the giving of aid to religious schools. The court concluded, therefore, that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment was not violated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 2 (renum. subd. 3 by L. 1966, ch. 795) of section 701 of the Education Law permits the appropriate school authorities to purchase textbooks and to loan them free, upon individual request, to all children who are enrolled in grades seven to twelve of a public or private school which complies with the compulsory Education Law. Section 3 of article XI of the New York State Constitution provides that &quot;Neither the state nor any subdivision thereof shall use its property or credit or any public money, or authorize or permit either to be used, directly or indirectly, in aid or maintenance, other than for examination or inspection, of any school or institution of learning wholly or in part under the control or direction of any religious denomination, or in which any denominational tenet or doctrine is taught&quot;.  Since there is no intention to assist parochial schools as such, any benefit accruing to those schools is a collateral effect of the statute, and, therefore, cannot be properly classified as the giving of aid directly or indirectly.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant longshoreman challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which, in a proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78, unanimously confirmed a determination of respondent Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor (commission) denying the longshoreman's application for registration as a checker and revoking his registration as a longshoreman.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The longshoreman was called before a commission lawyer to answer questions relating to his application for registration as a checker and, under oath, denied or claimed he could not recall having belonged to a subversive organization when he was a teenager. Thereafter, at a hearing ordered by the commission, testimony was given which indicated that not only had the longshoreman been a member of the organizations, but also that he had been active in the organizations' affairs. The commission found him guilty of fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation, revoked his registration as a longshoreman, and denied his application for registration as a checker. The commission's decision was affirmed on review. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the discipline imposed was too severe. It found that had the longshoreman told the truth, nothing untoward would have resulted since the activities in question occurred many years ago. Further, during the time he was registered, the longshoreman did not engage in unlawful or subversive activities or do anything else, apart from his deception in the interview, which would justify revoking his longshoreman's registration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the discipline imposed on the longshoreman by the commission was too severe, that a period of suspension would have been more appropriate and, since his registration was terminated nearly three years ago, any suspension beyond the date of its decision would constitute an abuse of discretion.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Waterfront Commission revoked the longshoreman registration of petitioner, who was 33 years old and had been a longshoreman since he was 19.  Upon his application to the Commission for registration as a checker, he was called before one of the Commission's lawyers for a series of interviews and, although notified that he had the right to be represented by counsel, he chose to appear at the interviews alone.  He was questioned under oath about alleged subversive activities when he was 15 or 16 years old and he denied, or claimed he could not recall, having belonged to, held office in, known officers of, or participated in the activities of the Young Progressives of America or the American Youth for Democracy, the latter an organization cited by the Attorney General of the United States in 1947 as subversive. The Commission concluded that his testimony was incredible and that his denials and lapses of memory were the products of &quot;fraud, deceit and misrepresentation&quot;  (Waterfront Commission Act, &sect; 5-h, subd. 3, as added by L. 1954, ch. 220, &sect; 2).

However, the court will decide questions which need not be reached when a case raises important constitutional issues and the controversy is of a character which is likely to recur.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, out-of-state executors of the estate of a corporate director, sought review of an order from the Supreme Court, Appellate Division (New York), which affirmed an order granting respondent stockholders' motion to substitute the executors as defendants in the stockholders' derivative action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was a corporate director of a company sued by the stockholders in a derivative action. The executors contested their substitution in the lawsuit asserting that New York courts could not obtain valid in personam jurisdiction over them. The decedent had voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the trial court. The court's decision was based solely on the issue of the constitutionality of out-of-state service upon nonresident executors of a tortfeasor's estate. The court held that NY. C.P.L.R. 302 and N.Y. C.P.L.R. 313 were constitutionally valid. Although prior decisions in New York had held that jurisdiction could not be obtained over foreign executors, the trend in modern caselaw decisions was to expand the concept of jurisdiction, particularly in light of the pronouncements by the United States Supreme Court on in personam jurisdiction. Those pronouncements held that service of process on out-of-state parties did not violate due process so long as sufficient minimum contacts existed with those parties so that the maintenance of a lawsuit did not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.</SPAN></P>

[a], par. 1) based upon his transaction of business in New York.  After voluntarily appearing in the action by filing an answer, defendant died and executors were appointed in Massachusetts.  Later, upon motion by the other defendants, a stay of all proceedings was granted until plaintiffs posted the required security.  After the stay was vacated, plaintiffs moved to substitute the nonresident executors for the deceased nonresident defendant pursuant to CPLR 1015 (subd. [a]) and substitution was ordered.  The executors contend that the New York courts cannot constitutionally obtain in personam jurisdiction over nonresident executors who have not committed acts or transacted any business within this State.  Out-of-State service upon the nonresident executors is permitted by CPLR 302 and 313, and such out-of-State service is not invalid or unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Court of Appeals is without power to review the exercise of discretion in ordering the substitution and upon an appeal based on a certified question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In any event the order of substitution pursuant to CPLR 1015 (subd.  [a]) and 1021 was effected within the discretion of the court and there is insufficient reason to find that it abused its discretion as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. At this stage of the proceedings, it is no valid objection to declare that any judgment rendered in this action would be of no force or effect against decedent's estate in Massachusetts under laws of that State.  Such conjecture is speculative and prematurely made.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landlord appealed orders of the Civil Court of the City of New York, Bronx County (New York), which dismissed her eviction proceedings against respondent tenants after finding that N.Y. Social Welfare Law &sect; 143-b was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord filed eviction proceedings against tenants, who were welfare recipients. The trial court dismissed the proceedings after finding that a hazardous condition existed in the building. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that N.Y. Social Welfare Law &sect; 143-b, which provided for rent abatement for welfare tenants who lived in buildings that contained a violation of law which was dangerous, hazardous or detrimental to life or health, was constitutional. The statute did not deny equal protection to landlords of welfare recipients because there was a reasonable basis for differentiating among landlords of welfare recipients and other landlords. The state could, in the exercise of its police power, provide for the curtailment of rent payments to landlords as a means of inducing them to eliminate dangerous housing conditions. Section 143-b provided landlords notice and an opportunity for a hearing. Section 143-b did not unconstitutionally impair the landlord's contractual rights because it was reasonably aimed at correcting the evil of substandard housing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the orders of the trial court dismissing the landlord's eviction proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- abatement of rent of welfare tenants for failure to correct violations in buildings -- section 143-b of Social Welfare Law provides for abatement of rent for welfare tenants who live in buildings containing violations of law which are dangerous; in summary proceedings for nonpayment of rent against welfare tenants, trial court dismissed petitions and held section constitutional; judgments affirmed -- no unlawful discrimination in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> against landlords of welfare tenants and no denial of equal protection of laws -- no denial of due process of law by total abatement of rent -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> provides for notice and hearing to landlord -- section does not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutionally</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> impair landlord's contractual</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 143-b of the Social Welfare Law provides an abatement of rent for welfare tenants who live in buildings that contain a &quot;violation of law * * * which is dangerous, hazardous or detrimental to life or health&quot;.  In these summary proceedings for nonpayment of rent against three welfare recipients whose rent had been paid by the Welfare Department, the Welfare Department's defense that a violation existed in the apartment of a fourth tenant who was not a welfare recipient and that there thus existed a dangerous condition which rendered the building unsafe for all tenants was upheld by the trial court who held the section constitutional and dismissed the proceedings.  The orders are affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although the landlord does not have standing to complain that the statute discriminates in favor of tenants who are welfare recipients, she is entitled to urge that it denies equal protection of the laws by providing a sanction only against landlords of welfare recipients. Such legislation is not unconstitutional as long as a reasonable basis exists for differentiating among the members of the same class.  Here it is the landlords of welfare recipients who, the Legislature found, &quot;conspicuously offend&quot;.  While they are not the only landlords who fail to make repairs in slum dwellings, welfare recipients have even less freedom than other tenants of deteriorated buildings in selecting a place to live.  And landlords of welfare recipients, secure in their receipt of rents directly from public funds, have even less incentive than other landlords to make repairs. Under circumstances such as these, if the Legislature chooses to impose a special sanction against those landlords, the equal protection clause does not forbid it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The State may, in the exercise of its police power, provide for the curtailment of rent payments to landlords as a means of inducing them to eliminate dangerous housing conditions.  The total abatement of rent provided by the statute does not deprive landlord of her property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Section 143-b is not unconstitutional because it does not, in so many words, call for notice and hearing to landlord. Both are implicit in the statutory scheme.  By providing that a violation of the building laws is &quot;a valid defense&quot; -- to be pleaded as such -- in a summary eviction proceeding (subd. 5, par. [a]), the section affords landlord ample notice of the violation and full opportunity to refute the claim and litigate the issue.  Landlord here received a full hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Section 143-b does not unconstitutionally impair landlord's contractual rights.  This remedial legislation is reasonably aimed at correcting the evil of substandard housing and may not be stricken as unconstitutional even though the means devised to accomplish that result may, to some extent, impair the obligation of landlord's contract.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) order affirming his convictions for conspiracy to riot, conspiracy to commit the crime of advocacy of criminal anarchy, and advocacy of criminal anarchy, N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 508, 2090, 160, 161. He alleged that &sect;&sect; 160, 161 were unconstitutional, that his punishment was directed solely at speech, and merger of conspiracy to riot with riot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of conspiracy to riot, conspiracy to commit advocacy of criminal anarchy, and advocacy of criminal anarchy under N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 508, 2090, 160, 161. The appellate court affirmed his convictions and he appealed, alleging that &sect;&sect; 160, 161 unconstitutionally restrained free speech, that the conviction for conspiracy to riot amounted to punishment for free speech, and that the conspiracy to riot charge merged with the dismissed charge of riot. The court affirmed. By an interim decision, the criminal anarchy statute,&nbsp;&sect;&sect; 160, 161, had been found unconstitutional as interpreted. The court reinterpreted the statute in light of modern day constitutional standards and ruled that defendant's words and actions created a &quot;clear and present danger&quot; that the riots then rocking Harlem would be intensified. It ruled that although speech may have been the means by which defendant sought to incite a riot to further the ends of conspiracy, speech was not in and of itself the object of a prosecution for conspiracy to riot and sufficient evidence supported the conviction for conspiracy. Conspiracy to incite riot was an independently indictable offense from the crime of riot.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was convicted on three counts, two of the counts charging him with conspiracy to commit the crime of advocacy of criminal anarchy (Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 160, 161, 580) and advocacy of criminal anarchy (Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 160, 161).  In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">People </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Gitlow</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (234 N. Y. 132), decided in 1922, sections 160 and 161 were held constitutional.  The United States Supreme Court affirmed (268 U.S. 652) over a dissent which insisted upon a showing of &quot;clear and present danger&quot; before one's freedom of speech, guaranteed by the First Amendment, might be abridged.  The United States Supreme Court has since held that the dissent represents the law today ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Dennis </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> United States</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 341 U.S. 494). As interpreted in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">People </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Gitlow</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the sections are unconstitutional.  Such decision does not, however, reflect the Legislature's intent to make unlawful the mere advocacy of violent revolution, and the court is not bound thereby but the sections must be re-examined and construed in accordance with sound constitutional principles so as to preserve their constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The proscription of mere advocacy of the violent overthrow of the Government would be an unconstitutional infringement upon free speech. The advocacy of the overthrow of the Government by force and violence must be accompanied by an intent to accomplish the overthrow and there must be a &quot;clear and present danger&quot; that the advocated overthrow may be attempted or accomplished. So interpreted the sections are constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. During the Summer of 1964, riots broke out in Harlem.  During the ensuing weeks, the evidence shows, defendant intended to inflame the already intense passions of the people of Harlem and to incite them to greater violence. Defendant's exhortations calling for organized resistance to the police and the destruction of the State, in the setting of Harlem during the week of July 18th, formed a sufficient basis for the trial court and jury to conclude that his words and actions created a &quot;clear and present danger&quot; that the riots in Harlem would be intensified or, if they subsided, rekindled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Reinterpretation of the criminal anarchy statute in accordance with modern day constitutional standards does not violate defendant's right to procedural due process on the theory that he was not given fair notice of what acts would be punished.  Aside from the fact that defendant can be charged with knowledge of the scope of subsequent interpretation by the Court of Appeals, he had the benefit of the Supreme Court's interpretation in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Dennis </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> United States</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (341 U.S. 494) of the Smith Act, the language of which is identical to sections 160 and 161.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A State can validly prosecute seditious activity directed against a State or local Government even though Congress has pre-empted the field of sedition which is directed against the Federal Government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. The gravaman of the charge of conspiracy to riot against defendant is that he entered into an unlawful agreement with others to incite and instigate riot and committed certain overt acts in furtherance of this end.  Though speech may have been a means by which defendant sought to further this end of the conspiracy, speech in and of itself is not the object of a prosecution for conspiracy to incite riot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The crime of conspiracy to incite riot does not merge in the crime of riot. Conspiracy is an independent crime for which a defendant can be indicted in addition to being indicted for the substantive crime he allegedly conspired to commit.  A conspiracy to riot is separable from the riot itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The judgment convicting defendant of the crimes of conspiracy to riot, conspiracy to commit the crime of advocacy of criminal anarchy, and advocacy of criminal anarchy is affirmed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employees sought review from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) in a proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78, which unanimously confirmed the determination of respondent municipal agency which found that the employees were in violation of the Condon-Wadlin Act (Act), N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 108, and which imposed certain penalties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that there was more than substantial evidence to support the findings of the hearing officer, adopted by municipal agency, that the employees were indeed engaged in a &quot;strike&quot; as that term is defined in N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 108(1). The court further concluded that the sanctions imposed by the municipal agency, such as loss of pay, loss of previously accrued vacation pay, demotion in title and part-time re-employment, were authorized by or permissible under the statute and were imposed in compliance with the necessary notice and hearing required by &sect; 108. The court rejected the employees' contention that &sect; 108 was unconstitutional on its face; &sect; 108 did not constitute a bill of attainder, impose excessive fines or inflict cruel and unusual punishment. However, the court found that the appellate division dismissed the petition without affording the employees an opportunity to factually prove in a court of law the discrimination they alleged. The court found that such an opportunity was required to properly determine the scope of the employees' constitutional rights and any violation thereof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the appellate division that unanimously confirmed the determination of the municipal agency without affording the employees an opportunity to prove discrimination. Such an inquiry was not within the province of the hearing officer, but had to be submitted to a judicial tribunal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil service -- strikes by public employees -- Condon-Wadlin Act is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> on its face -- it does not constitute bill of attainder -- stipulation that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> was not enforced against other striking public employees does not prove existence of purposeful plan of discrimination against petitioners depriving them of equal protection -- petitioners should be afforded opportunity to prove in court their allegation of purposeful discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioners, over 100 ferryboat officers employed under New York State Civil Service Law on ferries operated by the Department of Marine and Aviation of the City of New York, instituted a proceeding to review a determination by that municipal agency which found that they violated section 108 of the Civil Service Law (Condon-Wadlin Act) and which imposed certain penalties in accordance with that act.  There was substantial evidence to support the findings that petitioners were engaged in a &quot;strike&quot;, as defined in section 108 (subd. 1) of the Civil Service Law. The sanctions were authorized or permissible under the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Condon-Wadlin Act is not unconstitutional on its face as a bill of attainder or otherwise.  There is no constitutional provision barring the imposition of reasonable and necessary limitations and conditions on government employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The stipulation by the parties that the penalty provisions of Condon-Wadlin have not been used, with but two exceptions, over an almost 20-year period of numerous strikes by other public employees does not meet the burden of proof required to sustain petitioners' allegation that they were purposefully discriminated against in the application of Condon-Wadlin as against them, thereby depriving them of equal protection. It must be shown that the provisions of Condon-Wadlin were enforced pursuant to an intentional and invidious plan of discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Petitioners have had no forum at which they could demonstrate such purposeful discrimination, and they are entitled to such an opportunity.  The matter is remitted to the Appellate Division.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which reversed an order denying defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to prosecute and granted the motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged she was injured and brought an action against defendant. Defendant served on plaintiff a notice for a physical examination. Plaintiff failed to submit to the examination. Defendant moved to dismiss on the grounds of general delay. While the motion was initially denied, that denial was reversed on appeal and the motion was granted. Plaintiff appealed. The court found the facts of the case clearly indicated a general delay by plaintiff. The court's interpretation of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3216 was that it left untouched the general power of the courts to dismiss actions in their discretion for general delay, but mandated the 45-day demand requirement under the second paragraph of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3216 where the only basis for the motion was a delay in the filing of a note of issue not amounting to general delay. Since this was a general delay case, the 45-day notice was not required and dismissal was proper.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The second paragraph of CPLR 3216, which provides for dismissal of an action for failure to file a note of issue after a 45-day notice demanding such filing is served, does not apply where defendant makes his motion based on general delay.  Accordingly where an action was commenced and issue joined in June, 1962, no other steps were taken in the action by plaintiff and defendant moved in February, 1965 to dismiss because of general delay even though no note of issue had been filed, the motion was properly granted (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Salama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Tomich</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] v. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Cohen</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 16 N Y 2d 1058, insofar as to the contrary not followed).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner commenced proceedings to review the determinations made by defendant municipal zoning board that two billboards on the owner's land violated a town zoning ordinance. The owner appealed the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) that affirmed the trial court's denial of the owner's application for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged ordinance prohibited any billboards within the township that were not located on the same lot as the establishments they advertised. Dismissal of the application for review was affirmed because the ordinance was a reasonable regulation that protected the town from becoming an eyesore. The owner argued that the blanket prohibition was arbitrary and resulted in an unconstitutional deprivation of his property. The court held that the ordinance was constitutional. The court overruled a prior decision, which held an identical ordinance unconstitutional, because it was predicated on the discarded notion that an aesthetic objective alone did not support a zoning ordinance. Zoning ordinances based primarily on aesthetic concerns were no longer per se invalid in view of the decreased advertising importance of outdoor billboards, the substantial increase in the deleterious effects of outdoor advertising, and the changed perspective of courts in the area of economic regulation. However, only those aesthetic considerations that were substantially related to the economic, social, and cultural patterns of a community or district justified a blanket zoning prohibition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant welfare recipient sought review of the decision of the Niagara County Court (New York), which affirmed a city court's judgment convicting defendant of a violation of N.Y. Social Welfare Law &sect; 145 for his refusal to accept available employment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under N.Y. Social Welfare Law &sect; 131(4), the welfare recipient was not eligible for welfare payments if he refused to accept a position for which he was fitted and able to accept. The welfare recipient was trained at public expense in a landscape gardening school. However, when the state employment service referred him to a job as a landscape laborer, he told the employment official that it was not enough money and he desired to look for a job on his own. The trial court affirmed the city court's order, which convicted the welfare recipient of a misdemeanor under N.Y. Social Welfare Law &sect; 145 for his commission of a wilful act designed to interfere with the proper administration of public assistance and care. The court reversed the conviction and dismissed the information finding that the penal sanction of &sect; 145 was only intended to attach to a wilful act committed in furtherance of some fraudulent scheme to obtain undeserved welfare payments. Since the welfare recipient was not charged with fraud and no proof of fraud was produced at trial, the court concluded that his conviction had to be reversed and the information dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The Legislature intended to apply this penalty only if the act were committed in furtherance of some fraudulent scheme to obtain undeserved welfare payments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which held in favor of the state, affirmed the denial of defendant's motion to vacate his commitment order, and found N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 454 constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot and wounded three persons and pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. He was acquitted on the ground of insanity and committed to the state hospital. Defendant filed a motion to vacate his commitment order and argued that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 454 was unconstitutional in that it required him to prove his sanity and the right to be at large. Defendant did not request a hearing as to his present condition. The trial court denied defendant's motion. While &sect; 454 was constitutional, the court reversed the judgment and remitted the proceeding for a hearing to be held pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;&sect; 454(2), (3), &amp; (5) so that defendant would not be deprived of his constitutional rights. According to N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 74, any person civilly committed who was not a prisoner whose term was about to expire was entitled to a jury trial as to his mental competency. The court held that before there could be any commitment to the state hospital for the insane under &sect; 454 procedures, a person had to be accorded all the protections of N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect;&sect; 74, 85, which included a hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remitted the matter for a hearing as to defendant's competency. The court held that before defendant could be committed to the state hospital for the insane, the trial court was required to accord him a hearing, including a jury trial, if requested.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- acquittal by reason of insanity -- detention of defendant in hospital for criminally insane -- order, entitled in criminal action, refusing to vacate prior order committing defendant to State hospital for criminally insane, is appealable as resulting from petition in special civil proceeding -- section 454 of Code of Criminal Procedure providing for commitment of defendant in criminal case, who pleads not guilty by reason of insanity and is acquitted on that ground,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> to State mental hospital or hospital for criminally insane is constitutional -- defendant detained following acquittal of crime by reason of insanity is remitted for hearing under section 454 to determine if he may be released without danger to himself and others; court reads into subdivision (5) of section 454 provision for jury trial if requested by defendant -- petition seeking release of funds held by Director of hospital brings up exercise of discretion nonreviewable in Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An order, entitled in a criminal action, which refuses to vacate an order committing defendant to a State hospital for the criminally insane under section 454 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, is appealable despite the fact that it is not one of the orders listed as appealable in section 517 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, since the application to vacate constitutes the beginning of a special civil proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 454 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (subd. [1]) provides that in a criminal case, if defendant pleads insanity and the jury acquits him on that ground, the court must order defendant committed to the custody of the State Commissioner of Mental Hygiene to be placed in an appropriate institution in the Mental Hygiene or Correction Department.  Subdivisions (2) and (3) provide, in substance, that when, after commitment of such a defendant, the Commissioner of Mental Hygiene believes that defendant may be discharged or released on condition without danger to himself or others, he must apply for such discharge or release to the court, whereupon the court appoints psychiatrists to examine him and on receiving the report of the psychiatrists shall order his discharge or release on condition.  Subdivision (5) provides that a committed person may make, to the court by which he was committed, an application for his release or discharge following which the court must obtain a report from the Mental Hygiene Department and if the court thinks there is merit in the application shall hold a hearing, etc.  Subdivision (6) provides that any person so committed may at any time during his commitment be transferred to an appropriate institution of the Mental Hygiene or Correction Department approved by the heads of both departments.  The section is constitutional.  A man who has asserted that he was insane at the time he committed a crime and the jury acquits him on that ground should, in his own interest and for the protection of the public, be forthwith committed for detention, examination and report as to his sanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. So that defendant, who pleaded insanity and was acquitted on that ground and then detained pursuant to section 454 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, may not be deprived of any of his rights, the proceeding is remitted to Criminal Term of the Supreme Court for a hearing to be held pursuant to subdivisions (2), (3) and (5) of section 454.  The issues there to be tried are whether defendant may be discharged or released without danger to himself or to others, and, if that question be answered in the negative, whether he is so mentally ill as to require hospitalization. To provide defendant with protection equal to that of other persons under statutes relating to adjudications of mental incompetency the court reads into subdivision (5) a provision for a jury trial of these issues, if defendant so requests.  If it be determined as a result of the hearing that defendant, while not dangerous to himself or others, is mentally incompetent and in need of hospitalization, the court shall recommit defendant to the State Commissioner of Mental Hygiene for confinement in a State civil hospital for the insane. He shall in that event not be confined in Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Before there can be any commitment to Matteawan State Hospital for the insane under section 454 procedures, a person must be accorded all the protections of sections 74 and 85 of the Mental Hygiene Law including a jury trial, if requested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. So much of the petition as seeks release of part of defendant's funds held by the Director of Matteawan State Hospital for the purpose of obtaining independent psychiatrists to examine defendant and report to the court brings up a discretionary question not reviewable in the Court of Appeals.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent building association commenced an action against the commissioner and the preservation corporation to compel the issuance of a license to demolish an old opera house. Respondent opera association filed a lawsuit against the city and the preservation corporation to declare a newly enacted statute unconstitutional. The trial court declared the statute to be a taking of the opera association's property during the six-month period, found the amount of the deposit insufficient to cover the damage to be suffered, and further found that by limiting the recovery amount the Legislature illegally invaded the judicial province. The appellate division affirmed the trial court's decision, which was again affirmed on appeal. The court held that the statute was not enacted in furtherance of the police power. It thus constituted an unreasonable interference with property rights for which the State had to provide a sure and certain fund for recovery of the damage that would be suffered. The amount of such fund had to be established through the judicial process, not by the Legislature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the appellate court upholding the order declaring a state statute unconstitutional and directing issuance of a demolition permit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- stay of demolition of opera house -- chapter 691 of Laws of 1966, which created private corporation for purpose of preserving Metropolitan Opera House, was not enacted in exercise of police power, fails to provide definite fund for recovery of damages,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> fails to permit judiciary to determine just compensation and is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chapter 691 of the Laws of 1966, which created a private corporation to be known as The Old Met Opera House Corporation for the purpose of preserving the Metropolitan Opera House, gave it power to condemn the property, and provided that the Superintendent of Buildings of the City of New York could refuse a demolition permit for 180 days upon deposit of $ 200,000 by the corporation which would serve as security for any damages the owners might suffer, is unconstitutional.  It was not intended to protect the public health, safety and welfare and was not enacted in furtherance of the police power. As a condemnation statute, pending the exercise of the power of condemnation, it unreasonably interferes with the rights of the owners to build upon or improve their property.  The delay of six months cannot be justified.  The fixing of $ 200,000 as a fund for damages is inadequate.  Moreover, there is no guarantee that the assetless corporation will be able to pay damages in excess of the posted security.  The State must provide a sure and certain fund for the recovery of the damage which will be suffered.  The fixing of just compensation is a judicial function and the amount of compensation cannot be established by the Legislature.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Order reversed, without costs, and matter remitted to the Supreme Court, New York County, for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, Personnel Director of the Department of Personnel of the City of New York (department) challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a judgment in favor of petitioner employees invalidating employment reclassifications without examination made for intervenor incumbents by the Civil Service Commission of the City of New York (commission).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a series of promotion examinations, the employees had reached the highest civil service clerical position. The commission abolished the old classification and substituted a new grade providing that persons in the old class were eligible for reclassification without examination. The commission promoted the incumbents to the highest grade without examination. A New York court in an unrelated case held that civil service employees could not be assigned to a new grade without examination. Accordingly, the commission restored the original classifications and continued the incumbents in the highest grade. The employees challenged the continuance of the incumbents in the restored grade. The trial court held that the commission had no power to revive the abolished grade. The appellate court affirmed without opinion. On appeal, the court reversed. The commission could repeal or modify a rule that it had made. The commission had the latitude to assign duties and fix salaries within a class broadly achieved by competitive examination. Because transfers from one position to another in the same grade were valid, the reassignment of incumbents within the grade 5 was also valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's order, which had affirmed a trial court's declaration in favor of the employees and against the department that the commission's reclassifications were null and void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil service -- reclassification -- New York City Civil Service Commission, which in 1954 abolished highest clerical position (Rule X, Clerk, Grade 5) with unlimited salary, and substituted group of new classifications including Administrative Assistant and higher titles, had undoubted power in 1963, following adverse judicial decision, to modify rule it had previously made and to restore Rule X and reclassify thereto employees previously reclassified to Administrative Assistant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> but later reclassified to higher grades; petitioners, also reclassified to Administrative Assistant but not to higher grades, showed no clear right to invalidate commission's assignments and reclassification; public policy grounds allow administrative officers latitude to assign duties and fix salaries within class; order affirming judgment invalidating commission's reclassification reversed and petition dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The New York City Civil Service Commission, pursuant to a Career and Salary Plan authorized by the Board of Estimate, abolished effective July 1, 1954 the Rule X, Clerk, Grade 5, the highest clerical position in the city competitive civil service and a class without maximum salary, and substituted a new Rule XI clerical administrative group of new classifications, including Administrative Assistant and other higher titles, for which persons in the former Clerk, Grade 5, were declared eligible without further examination and without being made subject to any maximum salary specified for such new positions.  However, the basic concept of this allocation was invalidated in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Matter of Weber </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Lang</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (13 A D 2d 345, affd.  11 N Y 2d 997) which, although allowing initial allocations to new grades where substantially the same duties would be performed, required that, after an unlimited grade was abolished and broken down into new grades in actual operation, the former right of unlimited assignment be terminated as to new grades with respect to incumbents of the former unlimited grade who had not actually performed the duties of such new grades. In an effort to preserve to incumbents in the then unlimited grade their right to unlimited salary and to assignment to unlimited duties, the commission, pursuant to a request of the Board of Estimate, adopted on December 30, 1963 a resolution restoring to Rule X the unlimited type of positions existing prior to 1954.  The commission then approved the appointment and continuance in unlimited Grade 5 of those employees previously appointed, under the rescinded Rule XI, to grades higher than Administrative Assistant, and under such unlimited classification they were to receive the salary and perform the duties pertaining to the rescinded Rule XI positions.  In this proceeding by petitioners, who were reclassified effective January 1, 1956 from Rule X, Clerk, Grade 5, to the grade of Administrative Assistant but were never classified above such grade, Special Term invalidated the commission's 1963 appointment to the restored Rule X, Grade 5, of other employees who had likewise been reclassified from Rule X, Clerk, Grade 5, to Administrative Assistant but whom the commission thereafter reclassified, without examination, to higher grades. The court agreed with petitioners' contention that the former valid method of allocating duties and salaries within an unlimited grade could not be restored after the grade had been broken down into new components and that the commission, which had initially promulgated the allocation, had no power, as a matter of law, to rescind it.  However, the power of a public authority, with rule-making capacity, to repeal or modify a rule it has made, in the absence of demonstrable adverse effect on mature rights, must be assumed as a matter of course and be deemed undoubted.  The sweeping injunctive interdiction upon the city's reclassification granted at Special Term was unwarranted on this record, and an order affirming such injunction should be reversed and the petition dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioners do not show that they would pass promotion examinations for the abolished competitive grades above Administrative Assistant or that they will not be advanced in responsibilities or salaries under the now restored unlimited grade, but show that they have not yet been advanced and other employees have been.  Accordingly, occupying positions to which they have been duly promoted and which are not themselves changed by the new classifications, they show no clear right to invalidate the assignment of duties to other employees and the payment of salaries within the rules as now amended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Furthermore, there are public policy grounds to allow latitude to administrative officers to assign duties and fix salaries within a class broadly achieved by competitive examination and their judgment should not be overridden, unless interdicted by Constitution or statute.  If, as has been held, transfers from one position to another in the same salary grade are valid, the reassignment of various administrative duties to incumbents within the re-established Rule X, Grade 5, is also valid and, if the original unlimited grade was established by a valid exercise of administrative power, those city officers who had created the grade and who later had modified it would normally have power to restore it.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of the order of the Supreme Court (New York), which reversed the trial court's judgment that dismissed respondent claimant's claim, and which remitted the matter to the trial court to enter an award in favor of the claimant after a trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant owned a warehouse at an intersection. The level of one of the streets had been raised by a viaduct constructed in accordance with plans filed in the city's engineer's office in the years 1897, 1898, and 1914. It was level with the second story of the claimant's building, to which it furnished access by means of an aerial ramp. This viaduct had recently been demolished in connection with the construction of a specific section of a thruway. The street was thus lowered to its original grade affording access on that side to the claimant's building to the first floor only. The claimant filed an action against the state, seeking damages for change of grade authorized by Buffalo City, N.Y., Charter &sect; 367 (later amended). The trial court subsequently dismissed the claim. The lower court reversed the judgment dismissing the claim, and remitted the matter to the trial court to enter an award in favor of the claimant after a trial. The court affirmed the order, by holding that the claimant was entitled to damages for the demolition of the viaduct because the change of grade compromised the whole width of the traveled portion of the street outside the claimant's building.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, which reversed the trial court's judgment that dismissed the claimant's claim, and which remitted the matter to the trial court to enter an award in favor of the claimant after a trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent domain -- compensation -- change of grade -- where State eliminated viaduct constituting entire traveled portion of street on one of two streets abutting claimant's property thereby reducing street level to first floor, change of grade resulted -- damages authorized by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> for change of grade properly recoverable by claimant as abutting owner actually sustaining damage -- street elevation based upon actual grading work performed by city is established grade and was &quot;recorded&quot; within meaning of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> rendering city liable for damages for change of grade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Where claimant's property fronted on one street at the first floor level and on the intersecting street at the second floor level because of the construction of a viaduct by the City of Buffalo pursuant to plans filed in the City Engineer's office in 1897, 1898 and 1914, which viaduct constituted the only traveled portion of such street, a change of grade resulted when the viaduct was eliminated in the course of constructing a portion of the Thruway, thereby reducing the level of the entire traveled portion of the street to that of the ground floor of claimant's building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The State has assumed the liability of the city, imposed by the Charter (Buffalo City Charter, former &sect; 367), for damages resulting from the alteration of &quot;the recorded grade of any street&quot;.  What resulted to claimant's property was not the closing of the street, so that recovery of damages is precluded because suitable access was provided to the property by another street. Damages authorized by statute to be awarded for change of grade can be recovered by an abutting owner who has actually sustained such damage, as did claimant here, in cases where, under the common-law rule, it would have had no cause of action if the street whose grade was changed had been entirely eliminated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Buffalo City Charter (&sect; 674) provided that, when the grade of a street is changed, &quot;such alteration shall be recorded as provided in this act for the recording of the original establishment and description of such grade.&quot; Section 179 required the City Engineer to &quot;record all streets, * * * now or hereafter established, and record and describe the grades and any alteration of the grades thereof&quot;.  For purposes of liability for damages for change of grade, the legally authorized street elevation based upon the actual grading work performed by city authorities is the established grade, and the grade of the street abutting claimant's property was &quot;recorded&quot; sufficiently to come within the language of former section 367 of the Buffalo City Charter.  The technical oversight of the City Engineer does not exonerate the State from payment of damages.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the court of appeals (New York), which affirmed the trial court's judgment that convicted him of the crime of selling obscene material to an infant 17 years of age, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 484-i.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the instigation of a police operation, the 17-year-old infant approached defendant's cigar store, examined an outside stand containing &quot;girlie&quot; magazines, selected 2, and entered the store. Defendant looked at them, priced them, and sold them to the infant, who thereafter departed. Once outside, the infant wrote his name and the time and place of purchase on an inside cover without further examining the magazines' contents. The magazines sold to the infant were devoted purely to sex, told pictorially by nudes and by tales of sex orgies in picture and prose. Defendant was charged and convicted of the crime of selling obscene material to an infant 17 years of age. The trial court found that he had knowledge of the magazines' contents and sold them to a person under the age of 18 years. The court of appeals affirmed the conviction. The court affirmed the judgment, by holding that defendant's right to due process of law was not violated because &sect; 484-i was not unconstitutionally vague, where it neither unduly restricted dissemination of protected matter nor unduly inhibited receipt by those who were constitutionally entitled to receipt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals, which affirmed the trial court's judgment that convicted defendant of the crime of selling obscene material to an infant 17 years of age, in violation of the relevant statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- obscenity -- magazine sold by defendant, of whose contents he had knowledge, to 17-year-old boy, violated section 484-i of Penal Law forbidding dissemination of obscene material to those younger than 18; defendant's conviction properly affirmed -- section provides standard of obscenity and is not vague -- proof of seller's knowledge of age of purchaser is not predicate to conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A magazine, sold by defendant to a 17-year-old boy, fell within the ban of section 484-i of the Penal Law forbidding the dissemination of material obscene as to those under 18, though not necessarily obscene as to the adult community, and defendant had knowledge of its contents.  Accordingly, a judgment convicting defendant of violating the statute was properly affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 484-i divides the material to which it applies into three categories defined with precision and clarity.  The &quot;obscenity&quot; standard is the same.  The material must be &quot;posed or presented in such a manner as to exploit lust for commercial gain and which would appeal to the lust of persons under the age of eighteen years or to their curiosity as to sex or to the anatomical differences between the sexes&quot;.  The thrust of the statute is against pandering the obscene to minors.  Material which appeals to the minor's &quot;curiosity as to sex or to the anatomical differences between the sexes&quot; without more does not fall within the ban of the statute.  The words &quot;posed or presented in such a manner as to exploit lust for commercial gain&quot; exclude legitimate works of art, educational texts and literature with redeeming social value, and give clear and unequivocal warning of the conduct to be avoided.  There is nothing vague about the statutory prohibition and the statute provides reasonably ascertainable standards of guilt readily determinable by men of reasonable intelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Despite the fact that the statute forbids dissemination of the proscribed materials to those under 18, and affords full First Amendment protection of the same material to those 18 and older, proof of the seller's knowledge of the age of the purchaser is not a predicate to a conviction.  The statute neither unduly restricts dissemination of protected matter nor unduly inhibits receipt by those who are constitutionally entitled to receipt.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By its opinion, the court made it clear that the landowners were entitled to immediate payment of the award made below for the tangible property taken and that there was to be a further hearing with respect to the additional award for &quot;going concern&quot; value, to which the court held the landowners were also entitled. The court held that in view of the city's contention that N.Y.C. Admin. Code &sect; B15-21.0 prevented the entry of a separate partial decree directing payment of the award already made, the court granted the landowners' motion to amend the remittitur and make even more explicit the court's meaning. The court concluded that the landowners should not be denied a separate partial judgment in the present proceeding, for to do so would unnecessarily delay payment of an award already held to be due and owing and would thereby impose upon the landowners an undue hardship. Accordingly, the court held that a judgment reflecting the award for the tangible assets should now be entered and payment therefor made, subject, of course, to any lawful claims existing against such award.</SPAN></P>

The booksellers sought review from a judgment of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which held that N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 484-i, 484-h were constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bookseller was prosecuted for selling the book &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; to a person under the age of 18 in violation of former &sect; 484-h. The bookseller was found guilty, but the judgment was reversed and the section was declared unconstitutional. The legislature re-wrote the section. The bookseller did not allege that the new section was vague, but that the state did not have the power to pass such a statute. In affirming the decision of the trial court and rejecting the bookseller's argument that the distinction of age was an unconstitutional infringement upon the freedom of the press, the court noted that the Supreme Court had stated that a concept of variable obscenity for the protection of children, in a properly drawn statute, was not only within the power of the legislature but was a desirable and even necessary provision. The court held that, since material was not inherently &quot;obscene&quot; or unprotected, but its obscenity varied with the circumstances of its dissemination, the fact that &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; was deemed not obscene for sale to the general public in New York did not preclude a determination that it was harmful to minors or &quot;obscene&quot; as regards the community of those below 18.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Village of Scarsdale, in giving its Planning Commission power to approve proposed plats for subdividing lands in the village (Village Law, &sect; 179-k), had the power to authorize the planning board to require, as a condition precedent to the approval of subdivision plats which show new streets or highways, that the subdivider allot some land within the subdivision for park purposes or, at the option of the village planning board, pay the village a fee in lieu of such allotment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 1180 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law provides as follows: &quot;Basic rule and maximum limits.  (a) No person shall drive a motor vehicle on a public highway at a speed greater than is reasonable and prudent under the conditions and having regard to the actual and potential hazards then existing.  * * * (c) The driver of every vehicle shall, consistent with the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, drive at an appropriate reduced speed when approaching and crossing an intersection or railway grade crossing, when approaching and going around a curve, when approaching a hill crest, when traveling upon any narrow or winding roadway, and when any special hazard exists with respect to pedestrians, or other traffic by reason of weather or highway conditions.&quot; The language of subdivision (c) that &quot;The driver of every vehicle shall, consistent with the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, drive at an appropriate reduced speed&quot; applies subdivision (a) to the specific situations enumerated in subdivision (c).  When so read section 1180 (subd. c) is not unconstitutionally vague and indefinite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The County Court stated that, even assuming the validity of the statute, the People had failed to prove the case and the information should have been dismissed.  A question of fact was presented concerning the defendant's guilt under subdivision (c) of section 1180 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law. A new trial must be ordered instead of a dismissal if the reversal be on the facts rather than on the ground that the People failed to prove defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt as a matter of law. Here the statute is valid and a prima facie case was established.  The Court of Appeals has the power to review since the County Court dismissed the information which it could only do, and here did erroneously, in the determination of a question of law. Inasmuch as the reversal of the County Court was, therefore, also on the facts, the County Court could not dismiss but was obliged to grant a new trial, and in this situation the Court of Appeals cannot reinstate the judgment of conviction rendered by the Justice of the Peace but must order a new trial. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The people sought review of an order from the Dutchess County Court (New York) reversing a judgment convicting defendant of a violation of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1124 and dismissing the information. The issues were whether &sect; 1124 was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite and whether the evidence was sufficient to make out a question of fact for the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of a violation of &sect; 1124. The county court reversed the conviction and dismissed the information finding that &sect; 1124 was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite. On further review, the court reversed the order from the county court and ordered a new trial. The court held that the statute was sufficiently clear and positive to give the average citizen unequivocal warning of the rule to be obeyed. The statute dealt with a standard for passing other vehicles in circumstances too numerous or unpredictable for particular enumeration. Aside from hills and curves, &quot;clearly visible&quot; was plain language that might have encompassed such circumstances as weather conditions, hour of the day, and artificial light conditions. It informed drivers, in no uncertain terms, of what was expected of them. The same was equally true of &quot;free of oncoming traffic.&quot; A &quot;sufficient distance&quot; depended on circumstances prevailing at the time when judgment must have been exercised. That requirement did not make the statute vague or uncertain. The court found that the evidence was clearly sufficient to create a question of fact as to defendant's compliance with the statutory language.</SPAN></P>

If a question of fact was presented to the trial court, the County Court could not reverse and dismiss on the facts.  At most, it could order a new trial. The evidence was sufficient to create a question of fact as to the defendant's compliance with the statutory language.  Accordingly, a new trial is ordered.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant stockholder challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which struck from the trial court's order the leave to replead granted to the stockholder. The trial court granted respondent New York State Superintendent of the Insurance Department's (Superintendent) a motion to dismiss the stockholder's N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The stockholder petitioned for an article 78 proceeding to review and annul the action of the Superintendent approving a merger of insurance companies. The stockholder alleged that his constitutional rights were violated by the approval of the merger that &quot;froze&quot; him out and deprived him of his status as a stockholder. The trial court granted the Superintendent's motion to dismiss the petition for failure to sufficiently plead a cause of action, but it allowed the stockholder leave to amend the petition. The appellate court struck the stockholder's leave to amend, and the stockholder appealed. The court held the appellate court correctly struck the leave granted by the trial court to replead the allegations of fraud because there was no factual support for the allegations. The court found the Superintendent acted reasonably and rationally, and the record evidence warranted his approval of the merger. The stockholder erroneously used the article 78 proceeding to challenge the fairness of the stock valuation. The court also found that the stockholder had no constitutionally protected right to continue as a stockholder where he received fair and just compensation for his interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- merger -- Superintendent of Insurance properly approved merger where one company owned over 97% of other company's stock (Insurance Law, &sect; 486; cf. Stock Corporation Law, &sect; 85) -- petitioner, who owns less than 1/10 of 1% of stock of</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> merged corporation, entitled to payment in cash -- remedy of appraisal and payment sufficient protection -- payment of $ 25.74 per share was fair and equitable -- no showing of fraud -- petitioner properly required to apply to Special Term for leave to replead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Superintendent of Insurance approved a merger of American Surety Company of New York (American) and Transamerica Insurance Company (Insurance) which owned over 97% of American stock. Petitioner owns less than 1/10 of 1% of the issued and outstanding stock of American.  The proposed merger agreement provided that minority stockholders of American would receive $ 25.74 per share for their stock. Section 486 of the Insurance Law provides that the Superintendent shall approve a merger if he is satisfied that it &quot;is fair and equitable, and is not inconsistent with the laws and the constitution of this state and of the United States and that no reasonable objection exists thereto.&quot; Section 85 of the Stock Corporation Law permits freeze-outs where one of the merging corporations owned 95% of the stock of the other.  A minority stockholder has no constitutional right to preserve his status as a stockholder in the surviving corporation.  Section 85 anticipates a &quot;cash payout&quot; by which minority stockholders may be frozen out of continued participation in the merged corporation.  The validity of section 85 has previously been upheld ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Beloff </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Consolidated Edison Co</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., 300 N. Y. 11). The remedy of an appraisal and payment for one's shares affords fair and just compensation to dissenting stockholders while allowing the overwhelming majority to proceed with the merger. So long as the value of petitioner's interest is compensable, he has no constitutionally protected right to continue as a stockholder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Insurance Law had its own provisions regarding merger, but contained no merger statute such as section 85 of the Stock Corporation Law.  Nor, at the time of the merger, did the Insurance Law contain any provision tying it into the Stock Corporation Law.  It is clear, however, that under the present statutes, if the present case had arisen after September 1, 1964, there would be direct authority for the Superintendent's approval of this type of merger with a cash payout. Since mergers of stock insurance companies were authorized (Insurance Law, &sect; 481), it was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious for the Superintendent, when considering proposed mergers, to adopt as a standard that set by the Legislature in respect of other types of stock companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The determination of an administrative agency will be accepted by the courts if it has warrant in the record and a reasonable basis in law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The payment of $ 25.74 per share was fair and equitable and the Superintendent acted reasonably and rationally.  His approval was warranted by the record and has a reasonable basis in law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The inquiry at the present time in this proceeding is limited to the reasonableness and rationality of the Superintendent's act (cf. Insurance Law, &sect; 486).  This proceeding under CPLR article 78 is not the proper vehicle for determining the actual value of the stock. On the other hand, equity will act despite the existence of an appraisal remedy, where there is fraud or illegality.  Petitioner has made no showing of fraud, and the Appellate Division correctly struck the leave granted by the trial court to replead the allegations of fraud and required petitioner to apply to Special Term for leave to replead. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners sought review of a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York), which affirmed in part and reversed in part the decision of the trial court, which declared certain portions of the building zone ordinance of defendant city to be unconstitutional as applied to the property owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One set of property owners owned the interior parcel of land in question and another set of owners owned the perimeter parcels. The interior tract was used for industrial purposes. When the tract was sold in 1942, it was zoned industrial and remained so until 1960 when the building zone ordinance upzoned the properties to single family residence. All of the property owners claimed the ordinance was confiscatory in that none of the properties were adaptable to the uses permitted. The trial court found the ordinance confiscatory and unconstitutional as to the vacant interior parcels but upheld as to the improved perimeter parcels. The court of appeal affirmed with regard to the perimeter parcels but reversed as to the interior lands. On appeal, the court affirmed with regard to the perimeter parcels and reversed as to the interior parcels. The court held that the ordinance deprived the interior owners of the substantial use of their property for an unknown and uncertain number of years, and as to those owners, the ordinance was confiscatory and void. However, the improved perimeter was properly zoned as residential.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in the property owner's action against the city concerning a building code ordinance with regard to the perimeter parcels but reversed as to the interior parcels.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- with regard to owners of property on perimeter of oval area, who utilize their property under valid nonconforming uses for industrial purposes, amendment of zoning ordinance not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- ordinance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> as to interior parcels -- permitted uses there not feasible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Four of the plaintiffs are owners of all the land on the perimeter, while two of the plaintiffs own all but one acre of the land in the interior of a tract which consists of an oval-shaped dirt road enclosing four acres of undeveloped land, surrounded by five buildings of heavy mill construction, each of which face inward.  The uses permitted by an amendment to the zoning ordinance are single-family dwellings, municipal buildings, schools, colleges, etc., churches, scientific or research laboratories subject to the restriction that they &quot;may not offer any goods or services for sale&quot;, and florists' greenhouses, country estates, and nurseries.  The perimeter plaintiffs, who have continuously utilized their improved parcels for industrial purposes, have valid nonconforming uses.  The unimproved interior parcels have no nonconforming use. With regard to the perimeter parcels, the amended ordinance is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A nonconforming use may be considered in determining the effect of the ordinance upon the property.  In comparing the value of the land before and after the amendment of the ordinance to see if there is a confiscation, the continuing value as a nonconforming use must be considered.  Six years after the passage of the amendment the perimeter businesses are apparently flourishing and the property seems to be in profitable use.  The value of the parcels as nonconforming uses was not shown to be so disproportionate to their value as permitted uses as to amount to an economic taking of the property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Proof based on the unrealistic assumption that valuable buildings would be demolished and vacant lands sold whereas the statute, far from requiring such demolition, creates nonconforming uses which may continue indefinitely did not constitute proof of confiscation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Moreover, the evidence supports the finding of the trial court that the perimeter plaintiffs failed to show that their buildings could not be reasonably and economically converted to the permitted scientific or laboratory use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The interior parcels are virtually surrounded by 15 acres of industrial buildings and the surrounding nonconforming uses will apparently continue into the foreseeable future.  As the trial court found, it would offend common sense to hold that the permitted uses would be feasible. In addition the permitted uses of a research laboratory or greenhouse, while perhaps technically feasible on one of the two parcels, are not economically feasible. One interior parcel was neither functionally nor economically adaptable for any of the permitted uses.  The ordinance deprives the interior owners of the substantial use of their property for an unknown and uncertain number of years, and as to those owners the ordinance is confiscatory and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. While the result reached is anomalous and perhaps self-defeating, it is hoped that the legislative body will review the zoning regulation in light of the ruling that the present amendment is unconstitutional as regards the interior. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for unlawful possession of burglar's instruments. He argued that the tools were discovered as a result of an illegal search and seizure and should have been suppressed. The court affirmed the conviction. An off-duty police officer heard suspicious activity in his apartment building. After phoning the local police, he chased down one of the two suspects and frisked him. Feeling what he thought could have been a knife on defendant's person, the police officer confiscated an envelope containing burglar's tools. The tools were used in defendant's prosecution and he sought review. The court held that the police officer had a reasonable suspicion to stop defendant, which fulfilled constitutional requirements and the requirements of N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 180-a. Once the stop was justified, the police officer was allowed to frisk defendant for weapons. When a possible weapon was found, the police officer permissibly seized it, although it was not a weapon, but the instruments of a crime.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- unlawful search and seizure -- New York City policeman living in apartment house in City of Mount Vernon, while not in uniform, apprehended, questioned and frisked defendant who was tiptoeing about hallway and who fled at his approach; in defendant's pocket was plastic envelope which felt like weapon, and upon examination of envelope it was found to contain burglar's tools; policeman delivered defendant and tools to Mount Vernon</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> police; following defendant's indictment for possession of burglar's tools, his motions to suppress such seized evidence were properly denied and, on his plea of guilty, he was properly convicted -- section 180-a of Code of Criminal Procedure and prior case law authorize police to stop, question and frisk person, upon reasonable suspicion; then, if frisk and questioning reveal evidence and probable cause, police may arrest such person and seize such evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A New York City policeman, who lived in the City of Mount Vernon on the sixth floor of an apartment house which was served by an elevator, heard a noise at his door one afternoon, looked through a peephole in the door and saw two men tiptoeing about the hallway. He telephoned the Mount Vernon police, got his gun and returned to the door where he observed the men tiptoeing toward the stairway. He slammed his door and followed them.  He apprehended one of them, the defendant whom he did not recognize as a tenant, on the stairs.  The policeman asked him what he was doing there and defendant claimed he was looking for a girl friend, but refused to identify her because, he said, she was married.  Thereupon the policeman, who was not in uniform, frisked defendant for a weapon by tapping his groin pockets and under his arms.  He felt something hard which could have been a knife and withdrew from the right pants pocket an unsealed opaque plastic envelope which upon examination was found to contain six picks, two Allen wrenches with the short leg of each filed down to a screwdriver edge and a tension bar.  He recognized these as burglar's tools.  He took defendant down to the manager's office and turned him and the envelope over to the Mount Vernon police.  Following defendant's indictment for possession of burglar's tools (Penal Law, &sect; 408), his motions to suppress the seized evidence and dismiss the indictment were properly denied, and then, on his plea of guilty, he was properly convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The stopping, inquiring and frisking and the resultant seizure were lawful, both under case law ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">People </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Rivera</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 14 N Y 2d 441, followed) and under section 180-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Under section 180-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, such stopping, inquiring and frisking do not constitute an arrest. The statutory standard -- reasonable suspicion -- may be based on facts and circumstances of which a policeman has reasonably trustworthy information and upon his experienced appraisal of the appearance of criminal activity.  Finally, before he may arrest the suspect and seize evidence from his person, he must have reasonable or probable cause. On the scale of absolute knowledge, reasonable suspicion is somewhat below probable cause and is equally objective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Section 180-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not authorize &quot;unreasonable searches and seizures&quot; (U. S. Const., 4th Amdt.); indeed, there is not much difference between the statutory standard and the standard used prior to the statute in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">People </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Rivera</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Hallways and stairways of multiple dwellings are public places within the intendment of section 180-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed his conviction, upon his plea of guilty, for the misdemeanor crime of assault in the third degree. Defendant was imprisoned for one year, the maximum for a misdemeanor, and had to pay a $ 500 fine. If the fine was not paid, defendant was ordered imprisoned an additional day for each dollar remaining unpaid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an indigent, argued that the trial court knew of his indigency and it was a denial of due process and of equal protection to let his lack of money determine how long he was to be imprisoned. The maximum term of imprisonment for a misdemeanor was one year (eight months with time off for good behavior). The sentence of imprisonment for defendant's nonpayment of the fine was reversed. The court found that defendant's sentence meant that he would have been confined for 8 months plus 500 days. Essentially, defendant would have been a prisoner for 26 months for a crime that the maximum term was 1 year. The court ruled that a fine of $ 500 for a misdemeanor, levied on defendant who had no money at all, was necessarily excessive when it meant in reality that he had to be jailed for a period far longer than the normal period for the crime. The court held that when payment of a fine was impossible and known by the trial court to be impossible, imprisonment to work out the fine, if it resulted in a total imprisonment of more than one year for a misdemeanor was unauthorized and violated defendant's right to equal protection and the constitutional ban against excessive fines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the sentence of imprisonment for nonpayment of a fine and ordered defendant discharged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- sentence -- imprisonment for failure to pay fine -- sentencing court knew that defendant, who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor, had no funds and was unable to pay fine -- sentence of one year and fine of $ 500, with provision that fine, if not paid, be served out at rate of one day's imprisonment for each dollar unpaid, was illegal -- defendant discharged from custody -- defendant's right to equal protection of law and constitutional ban against excessive fines violated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant, having pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, was given a sentence of one year and required also to pay a fine of $ 500, the fine, if not paid, to be served out at the rate of one day's imprisonment for each dollar remaining unpaid ( Penal Law, &sect; 245; Code Crim.  Pro., &sect;&sect; 484, 718).  The sentencing court knew that defendant had no funds or property and was unable to pay the fine, with the result that, whereas the maximum term of imprisonment for a misdemeanor is one year, defendant was to be confined for eight months (with time off for good behavior) plus 500 days.  The sentence was illegal and defendant should be discharged from custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The direction that defendant shall go to jail for nonpayment of the fine is not part of the punishment but a means of collecting the fine. It, therefore, is contrary to the meaning and intent of section 484 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to order a defendant to stay in prison a total of more than a year until he pays a fine, when the court knows that he cannot possibly pay it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sergeant in state police sought review of the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which entered an order modifying the law and facts and affirmed the judgment of the supreme court at a special term which determined that respondent superintendent of the division of state police had failed to show any necessity for a regulation authorizing a promotion examination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sergeant was required to take an examination under Article 10 of the State Police Department Rules and Regulations. A challenge was brought against the regulation under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78. The special term set aside the article. The superintendent appealed to the appellate division and the sergeant was allowed to intervene. The appellate division sustained that part of the order of the special term that annulled the examination for sergeant but refused to pass on the examination for lieutenant since the police superintendent had not had the opportunity to justify the degree of subjectivity in the examination. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that because the sergeant had passed the examination that was the basis for the challenge, he did not have standing to intervene in the action. The court reasoned that the examination against which the sergeant sought relief had not injured him in any way. The court held that for misbehavior of an officer, in his office, either for misfeasance or nonfeasance, no one could maintain an action against him, unless he could show a special and particular damage to himself, and that it had damaged his private rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the special term, which had sustained the sergeant's right to intervene in the appeal challenging the superintendent's regulation requiring the promotion examination. The court remitted the matter to the special term for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil service -- State Police -- parties aggrieved -- petitioner, who sought order annulling regulations of New York State Police and promotion examination for Sergeant based upon said regulations, is not party aggrieved and has no right to maintain proceeding where he took examination and passed it -- petitioner does not have right as private citizen and taxpayer to maintain proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. After the court at Special Term had dismissed the original petition to annul article 10 of the Regulations of the New York State Police and a promotion examination announcement for Sergeant based upon said article 10, the promotion examination was held and was taken and passed by petitioner.  He thus became eligible for promotion to Sergeant.  Therefore, the examination against which he seeks relief herein has not injured him.  Moreover, after he became eligible for promotion, charges were instituted against him for failure to obey a lawful command of a superior officer and, as a result of these charges, he was dismissed from the State Police.  Petitioner is not a party aggrieved and has no right to maintain this proceeding to set aside the rules or the examination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. He does not have a right as a private citizen and taxpayer to maintain this proceeding (cf.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">St. Clair </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Yonkers Raceway</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 13 N Y 2d 72). The courts are not given jurisdiction as guardians of the rights of the people generally against illegal acts by the executive or legislature but, when a controversy arises between litigants, the court must then follow the Constitution and may incidentally pass upon an act of the executive or legislative branches while determining the individual rights of the parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Petitioner has made no showing to bring his case within the exception to the rule under which the Court of Appeals, on occasion, decides questions which, even though moot as between the parties, affect the entire State or transactions of a similar character which are numerous and likely to arise with frequency. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1943 was amended, effective 1964, to provide that a previous conviction should not be utilized as a predicate for multiple offender treatment if the earlier conviction was obtained in violation of the United States Constitution. The county court concluded that the new 1964 language operated only when the prior conviction sought to be challenged was had in another state. However, the new language specified &quot;a previous conviction in this or any other state.&quot; The appellate division reversed, holding that the 1964 amendment had retroactive effect and that the statute by clear and unambiguous language permitted a defendant to challenge for constitutionality a previous conviction in the State of New York. Conceding that the principal purpose of the amendment was to challenge convictions obtained in other states, the court found no way to avoid the statutory language &quot;previous conviction in this or any other state.&quot; As to the retrospective application of the 1964 amendment to multiple offender sentences prior to the effective date of the amendment, it was settled by prior case law that the amendment was generally retroactive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a judgment of the trial court rendered upon a verdict convicting defendant of endangering the life or health of a child in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 483(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an adult male, bought beer and hosted a party for several teenaged boys, all of whom were minors. One boy was killed on his way home after being struck by an automobile, and several others became drunk and sick. On appeal, defendant contended that the indictment should have been dismissed because the Grand Jury was prejudiced by the introduction of irrelevant evidence regarding the boy's death and that the introduction at trial of the same evidence denied him a fair trial. He argued that, because the bill of particulars did not set forth what acts or conduct of defendant were claimed to have caused the boy's death, nor was there any proof on the trial as to the circumstances of his death, the evidence relating to the death was immaterial, irrelevant, and highly prejudicial. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment, finding that because defendant was on trial for endangering the life and limb and injuring the health of the boy, the fact of his death would seem to be highly relevant. The evidence presented was clearly material to the issue whether defendant's conduct caused or permitted the life or limb of the deceased child actually to become endangered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate division affirming defendant's conviction for endangering the life and health of children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- endangering life or health of child -- Penal Law ( &sect; 483) protects physical health of child and was properly applied to defendant who organized beer party for boys -- immaterial</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> that defendant was indicted under subdivisions 1 and 2 of section 483 rather than subdivision 3 of section 484 which makes it misdemeanor to sell alcoholic beverages to children under 18 -- evidence that boy covered by first count of indictment died was relevant before Grand Jury -- and on defendant's trial -- Penal Law ( &sect; 483) is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 483 of the Penal Law (endangering life or health of child) is not confined to sexual offenses or morals cases but is intended to protect the physical health, morals and well-being of children and was properly applied to defendant who organized a beer party for boys 16 years of age and under.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. That defendant was indicted under subdivisions 1 and 2 of section 483 and not under subdivision 3 of section 484 which makes it a misdemeanor to sell, give away or procure to be sold or given away alcoholic beverages to children under the age of 18 is of no consequence.  The same act may constitute a different crime and be punishable in different ways, and the State may proceed under a general statute even though a more specific one is available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Since the first count of the indictment charged that defendant wrongfully and knowingly caused the life of a named boy to be endangered and his health impaired, and the other three counts charged that defendant caused or permitted each of three other boys to be placed in a situation that his life or limb was endangered or his morals likely to be impaired, mention of the death of the boy covered by the first count of the indictment was neither incompetent nor immaterial. Such evidence was not illegal when presented to the Grand Jury.  In order to obtain an indictment or conviction under the first count, the People had to allege and prove that the boy's life, limb or health </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">did in fact</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> become endangered, as distinguished from the fact that such eventualities only need </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">likely</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to have transpired under the other three counts.  In order to show the actual danger to which the boy was exposed, it was relevant to show his death.  The trial court's conclusion that none of the evidence was illegal is supported by the record, as well as fortified by the presumption that an indictment is found upon legal evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. On the trial also the fact of the boy's death was relevant to the issue whether defendant's conduct caused or permitted the life or limb of the deceased child actually to become endangered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Section 483 of the Penal Law is not unconstitutional as vague.  This statute informed defendant that the offense prohibited was the endangering of the life, limb, health or morals of a child and what was required of him was that he refrain from willfully causing or permitting such danger.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, county and its comptroller, challenged the order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which annulled a determination of the comptroller that assessed a deficiency against petitioner racetrack on its county admission taxes, and granted the racetrack's petition for a judgment that declared unconstitutional 1956 N.Y. Laws 837 and Nassau County, N.Y., Loc. Law 1 (1956).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to 1956 N.Y. Laws 837 and Nassau County, N.Y., Loc. Law 1 (1956), the county imposed a 30 percent tax on admissions to harness horse race meetings that were held at racetracks located in cities or counties that were adjacent to a certain metropolitan area. The racetrack challenged the tax's validity because only a 15 percent tax was imposed on flat racetracks. The appellate division ordered that the racetrack's tax deficiency was annulled and declared that 1956 N.Y. Laws 837 and Nassau County, N.Y., Loc. Law 1 (1956) were unconstitutional because they lacked a rational basis for a distinction between a tax on flat and harness racetracks. The court reversed the appellate division's order and held that the geographical classification was proper and that the government's power to single out classes of objects for taxes was unquestionable. The court held that it could not say that the classification between flat and harness racetracks was arbitrary and without a reasonable justification because the local governmental legislation and management of harness racetracks adjacent to the metropolitan area were sufficiently different from the flat tracks that were located elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the appellate division that annulled the comptroller's determination and that granted the racetrack's petition, and the court remitted the matter to the comptroller for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- admissions tax -- horse races -- chapter 837 of Laws of 1956 and Nassau County Local Law No. 1 of 1956, pursuant to which county</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> was authorized to impose 30% tax on admissions to harness horse races held at petitioner's racetrack in Nassau County, retaining limit of 15% on admissions at &quot;flat tracks&quot;, are constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Chapter 837 of the Laws of 1956 and Nassau County Local Law No. 1 of 1956, pursuant to which the county, by authorization of the State statute, imposed a 30% tax on admissions to the harness horse races held at petitioner's racetrack in Nassau County, are constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The statute, permitting an increase from 15% admission tax to 30% at harness tracks in cities or counties adjacent to a city having a population in excess of 2,000,000, but retaining the limit to 15% on &quot;flat tracks&quot;, limited the increase to petitioner's track in Nassau County and a similar harness racing track in Westchester County.  Such geographical classification is valid and did not deny equal protection of the laws to petitioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The law was not local and did not require, under (former) article IX (&sect; 1, subd. [b]) of the New York State Constitution, a request from the local Board of Supervisors for a certificate of necessity transmitted by the Governor to the Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Nassau County Local Law,  passed three days before the State enabling act was signed by the Governor, was not void.  The local law provided that it should take effect immediately if the Governor meanwhile should have approved the State act, but that, if the Governor should not have attached his signature to the State act on or before the approval of the local law, the latter should take effect on the day on which the Governor should approve the State act.  Such arrangements for a statute taking effect on the happening of a future event do not result in invalidity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Section 9 of article I of the State Constitution permitted pari-mutuel betting on horse races &quot;as may be prescribed by the legislature and from which the state shall derive a reasonable revenue for the support of government&quot;.  This does not mean that the county, as distinguished from the State itself, may not be authorized to collect a tax on admissions to a racetrack where there is pari-mutuel betting. The tax here concerned is not a tax on betting but on admissions fees charged for entering the racetrack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. There is a rational basis for different treatment of &quot;flat tracks&quot; and &quot;harness tracks&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Petitioner, being required by law to collect and pay over this tax, is a party aggrieved and has standing to maintain this proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The constitutionality of the statute and local law may be tested in a proceeding under article 78 CPLR.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former tattoo parlor operators, who were put out of business by &sect; 181.15, which outlawed tattooing except by a doctor, brought an action to declare &sect; 181.15 unconstitutional and to enjoin defendants from enforcing it. The trial court declared &sect; 181.15 unconstitutional and the intermediate court reversed, holding that the record showed that the prohibition of lay tattooing was an advisable procedure for the security of life and health. Defendants argued that there was a direct causal connection between tattooing and hepatitis, and that the threat was too dangerous and deadly to depend on regulatory measures to assure proper sterilization techniques in tattooing. The court on appeal affirmed the intermediate court's decision. The court held that there was no warrant for the charge that defendant board of health acted arbitrarily or capriciously or that the regulation under attack was unreasonable. The court further held that &sect; 181.15 was not an unconstitutional exercise of legislative power by the board of health in violation of N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 1. The court also found that the state legislature had not preempted the field in enacting provisions pertaining to tattooing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the intermediate court's decision that the city health code regulation, which prohibited tattooing except by a doctor, was not unconstitutional and that rejected the former tattoo parlor operators' request for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Health -- tattooing -- provision of section 181.15 of New York City Health Code, which prohibits tattooing by person not licensed to practice medicine or osteopathy, is constitutional -- evidence demonstrates compelling medical necessity for said provision -- its enactment was constitutional exercise of power vested in Board of Health -- State has not evidenced any desire or design to pre-empt field -- plaintiffs seeking declaration of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutionality,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> not being doctors or prospective tattoo customers, lack requisite standing to raise questions as to portion of section which prohibits tattooing even by physicians except for medical purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The provision of section 181.15 of the New York City Health Code, which prohibits the tattooing of a human being by a person not licensed to practice medicine or osteopathy, is constitutional.  It has been established that there is a connection between tattooing and hepatitis, that rigorous regulation of the tattoo industry, with the aim of permitting tattooing without danger to the public, would be ineffective, and that tattooing is a health hazard which can be controlled only by the prohibition of lay tattooing. Since the evidence demonstrates compelling medical necessity for the provision, it is not unreasonable and the Board of Health did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in enacting it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The enactment was a constitutional exercise by the Board of Health of the power vested in it by the New York City Charter (&sect; 558, subds. b, f).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The State Legislature clearly intended the Board of Health to be the sole legislative authority within New York City in the field of health regulations so long as its regulations are not inconsistent with, or contrary to, State law dealing with the same subject matter (N. Y. City Charter, &sect; 558; Public Health Law, &sect; 228).  The State has not purported to regulate those engaged in the business of tattooing nor has it evidenced any desire or design to pre-empt that field.  Accordingly, the provision is not unconstitutional by reason of pre-emption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiffs are neither doctors nor prospective tattoo customers and they therefore lack the requisite standing to question, on constitutional grounds, that portion of the section which prohibits tattooing even by physicians except for medical purposes.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner brought an action against defendant utility for removal of a gas main. The Supreme Court, Westchester County (New York) granted the utility's motion for summary judgment for an order of inverse condemnation and appointed commissioners to fix the property owner's compensation. The Supreme Court, Appellate Division (New York) affirmed, as modified to have the trial court fix the compensation. The utility appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility's gas main was installed under a highway to the center of which the property owner had a fee interest. The town had an easement for highway purposes and granted the utility the right to lay the gas main. The utility argued that the main's installation was within the scope of the town's easement. The court concluded that the town's easement included only the right of passage over the property owner's land. The court considered the principle of stare decisis and found no reason to disturb a rule of property that affected many land titles. The property owner was entitled to recover compensation for the value of the land appropriated by the utility for the gas main.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Easements -- easement for public highway purposes -- scope of easement -- easement acquired by town to use land for public highway purposes does not include right to install gas main beneath it or to authorize utility corporation to do so -- such installation is, in essence, partial taking which may result in consequential damage to adjacent land -- fee owner is entitled to opportunity to prove damages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An easement acquired by a town to use land for public highway purposes does not include the right to install a gas main beneath it or the right to authorize a utility corporation to do so.  This is so whether the roadway involved is a rural or more populous highway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Such an installation is, in essence, a partial taking which may cause only nominal damages but, in some instances, may result in serious consequential damage to the adjacent land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Accordingly, where plaintiff owns the fee to one half of a street and the town, which has an easement for public highway purposes, has permitted a utility corporation to install a gas main beneath it, plaintiff is entitled to an opportunity to prove damages at a hearing.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed an appeal from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which unanimously affirmed an order of the trial court dismissing the complaint under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3216 as against one defendant due to plaintiff's unreasonable neglect to proceed in the action as against that defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued defendants, alleging liability on guarantees in commercial transactions. Three years after the complaint was filed and answered, plaintiff served a note of issue and statement of readiness on all defendants, but immediately withdrew these documents so that one defendant could complete pretrial procedures. Four years then elapsed with no activity in the case. Plaintiff then served and filed another note of issue and one defendant moved to dismiss, failing, however, to comply with the second paragraph of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3216. The court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint as against that defendant. Although the legislature had set forth specific steps for dismissal of suits for lack of prosecution in the second paragraph of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3216, trial courts could still dismiss suits for general delay under the first paragraph. Issue had been joined six and one half years earlier, but plaintiff let the action lie dormant, taking no affirmative steps whatever for four years, except to file the note of issue at the last minute, and plaintiff offered no excuse for this inordinate delay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order dismissing plaintiff's complaint, with costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Dismissal and nonsuit -- dismissal for general delay -- courts still have power to dismiss actions for general delay under first paragraph of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CPLR 3216</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, notwithstanding addition of second paragraph thereto which relates to dismissal motion based upon failure to serve and file note of issue and which provides for service of demand prior to making of motion -- where dismissal motion is made after service and filing of note of issue, said second paragraph has no application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Prior to September 1, 1964, CPLR 3216 provided that &quot;Where a party unreasonably neglects to proceed in the action against any party who may be liable to a separate judgment, the court, on its own initiative or upon motion, may dismiss the party's pleading on terms.&quot; Effective September 1, 1964, a second paragraph was added to CPLR 3216 which provided that no motion to dismiss &quot;based upon the failure of the plaintiff to serve and file a note of issue&quot; shall be made or granted until at least six months after the joinder of issue and unless the defendant shall have served a written demand requiring the plaintiff to serve and file a note of issue and, in effect, giving the plaintiff 45 days in which to do so.  The addition of this second paragraph was not intended to have the effect of eliminating the first paragraph.  The courts still have the power to dismiss actions for general delay.  This is confirmed by the history of an unsuccessful attempt made in 1965 to amend CPLR 3216.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In the present case, defendant-respondent made a motion to dismiss without complying with the second paragraph of CPLR 3216 and it was granted.  Plaintiff relies upon the said second paragraph but it has no application since the dismissal motion was made after plaintiff had served and filed its note of issue. </SPAN></P>

Upon respondent's death, the lower court issued an order excluding from the gross estate certain real property located in Connecticut owned by respondent and his son, which has been taxed in Connecticut.

The court reversed, holding that the partnership agreement was made in New York State subject to the New York State Partnership Law contained express provisions under N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed an order determining that the value of respondent decedent's interest in certain real estate be excluded from the gross estate subject to tax because the real property although located in another state, was owed by respondent's partnership and, therefore, was subject to the partnership laws applicable in the state in which the partnership was established.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, it was error to exclude such real property from the gross estate of decedent and to fail to compute the New York estate tax thereon.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of a decision of the County Court of Chautauqua County (New York), which reversed a judgment that convicted defendant of driving a vehicle that had an inadequate muffler, in violation of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Laws &sect; 375(31), and dismissed the information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county court held that &sect; 375(31) was unconstitutional for vagueness. The court reversed. The court held that a criminal statute had to be sufficiently definite, clear, and positive to give unequivocal warning to citizens of the rule that was to be obeyed. The court also held that all presumptions and intendments favored the validity of a statute, and that mere doubt did not afford sufficient reason for a judicial declaration of invalidity. According to the court, the test was whether a reasonable man, who was subject to the statute, would have been informed of the nature of the offense that was prohibited and what was required of him. The court also held that such a warning had to be unequivocal, but the requirement did not preclude the use of ordinary terms to express ideas that found adequate interpretation in common usage and understanding. The court thought that &sect; 375(31) sufficiently described the evil to be prevented and informed the motorist of his duty, not to eliminate all noise, but to have a properly maintained muffler to prevent unusual noise. The court also held that when the noise exceeded the usual level, the motorist had violated the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor vehicles -- mufflers -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Vehicle and Traffic Law ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">&sect; 375</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 31</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) requiring motor vehicle to be equipped with muffler properly maintained to prevent excessive or unusual noise is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subdivision 31 of section 375 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law providing that &quot;Every motor vehicle, operated or driven upon the highways of the state, shall * * * be equipped with an adequate muffler * * * and properly maintained to prevent any excessive or unusual noise&quot; states with sufficient clarity the rule to be obeyed and is constitutional.  The evil sought to be prevented is &quot;excessive or unusual noise&quot; and the statute sets up standards and definitions covering prevention of excessive noises emanating from mufflers. What is usual noise in the operation of an automobile has become common knowledge and anything in excess of that is excessive or unusual and any ordinary motorist should have no difficulty in ascertaining whether or not excessive or unusual noise accompanied the operation of his vehicle.  That a truck may make more noise than defendant's vehicle and not violate the statute is not vital. The vital point is that the duty upon all motorists to provide a muffler which will prevent noise greater than the usual noise from the exhaust system of their particular vehicle is exactly the same and the statute applies equally to all.  The enactment in 1965 of section 386 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, limiting the amount of noise produced by any vehicle, does not amend subdivision 31 of section 375.  The two statutes stand side by side.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff resident appealed a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the order granting the motion of defendant non-residents to dismiss the fraud action for lack of personal jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A resident of the state served a fraud action on non-residents in Austria where they lived and carried on the business of producing and marketing leather. The resident alleged that the non-residents appointed him as their exclusive agent in the United States and made intentionally false representations that they would not supply the leather to anyone else in the country in competition with the resident. The contract was arranged in Paris and the non-residents made the shipments to the resident f.o.b. European ports. The resident appealed the dismissal of the action. The court refused to exercise personal jurisdiction over the non-residents under N.Y.C.P.L.R. 302(a)(2) or (1). The court held that the resident failed to make a sufficient showing that the non-residents' tortious acts were committed within the state because they did everything in Europe. The court that the cause of action did not arise out of any transaction of business by the non-residents in the state because they carried on no sales, advertising, or promotion activities in the state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff is a resident of this State and does business in New York City as a dealer in imported leather. Defendants live in Austria and carry on the business of producing and marketing leathers. Plaintiff alleges that he suffered damage because of the willful fraud and deceit of defendants in that the latter, when appointing plaintiff as defendants' exclusive United States agent to import and distribute defendants' leather products, made intentionally false representations to plaintiff that their leather would not be supplied to anyone else in this country in competition with plaintiff, and that defendants never intended to keep their promises but, in fact, sold their leather goods to codefendants. All shipments from defendants to plaintiff were, as agreed, f. o. b. European ports.  The original contract between plaintiff and defendants was arranged at a meeting in Paris and, when plaintiff returned to New York, defendants wrote from Austria to plaintiff in New York a letter confirming the conversation in which plaintiff had been granted the sole American agency for one year. Plaintiff was not paid on a salary or commission basis but bought the leather and paid for it.  A motion by defendants to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the defendants had never transacted any business in the State of New York and that the court had not acquired personal jurisdiction as to them was properly granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. There is no sufficient showing under paragraph 2 of subdivision (a) of CPLR 302 of the commission by defendants of a tortious act within this State.  The statutory phrase is not synonymous with &quot;commits a tortious act </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">without</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the state which causes injury within the state&quot;.  The statute requires that a defendant's act of omission occur within the State.  Here, everything defendants did was done in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There is no adequate showing of a cause of action arising from the transaction by defendants of any business in this State under paragraph 1 of subdivision (a) of CPLR 302.  Defendants never came into New York State but sold and sent goods into the State pursuant to an order sent from within the State.  These defendants, in Austria, made arrangements to sell merchandise f. o. b. to the local distributor. They carried on no sales, promotion or advertising activities in this State.  The cause of action here sued upon cannot be said to have arisen out of any transaction of business in this State.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The street owner obligated itself, by contracts with abutting homeowners, to maintain and repair the streets until title to the streets was acquired by the city. Although the owner let the public use the streets for years, the city never took title or made repairs. The court reversed an order of the appellate court affirming the supreme court's order denying the owner summary judgment and granting the city summary dismissal in the owner's action claiming an unconstitutional taking of property. The court then remitted to the supreme court, holding that the owner was entitled to a declaration that municipal regulation of parking on the streets did not prevent it from barring parking altogether. The court reasoned that the police could enforce only the city parking regulations, but the owner could assure compliance with its rules by using traditional common-law remedies. The court also reasoned that there was no constitutional defect in N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1642 to the extent that the municipality forbid parking on the streets because that was a proper objective for the exercise of police power and the power to regulate traffic included the power to prohibit parking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that those charged with traffic infractions were expressly excluded from a new statutory scheme for providing counsel to indigent defendants. The court therefore concluded that the new statutory scheme was a clear indication that the legislature had not departed from existing case authority that the court in the City of New York having jurisdiction of traffic infractions was under no statutory duty to inform a defendant of his right to counsel in a trial for a traffic infraction. The court further held that neither the state nor federal Constitution required the court having jurisdiction of a petty offense such as a traffic infraction to advise defendant of the right to counsel. The court noted that New York had long deemed traffic infractions as a form of misconduct distinguishable from more serious breaches of law, and concluded that a traffic court needed only to assure that defendant had a fair forum in which to be heard. The court accordingly reversed the judgment of the appellate court that had reversed defendant's speeding conviction and affirmed the judgment of the appellate court that had affirmed the other defendant's speeding conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department store was a Delaware corporation that had its principal office in Cincinnati, Ohio, and that owned three large department stores in New York city. The city comptroller had issued a determination against the department store that it owed additional sales taxes, which was confirmed by the lower court. On appeal by the department store, the court affirmed the lower court's order. The department store vigorously attacked as both unfair and unconstitutional the formula that the city comptroller had used in apportioning the taxes against it. The court rejected the argument that the tax tended to increase the department store's out of state and wholly non-taxable sales receipts. Although the department store owned many stores in other states, these stores did not contribute much to the sales of the New York city stores. The court did not find the department store had demonstrated unfairness in the actual impact on it of the tax assessments of which it complained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's order that confirmed a determination of the city comptroller that the department store owed additional sales taxes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- general business and financial tax -- City of New York imposes excise tax for privilege of carrying on business therein -- formula of Comptroller for allocation of that portion of interstate transactions which for local tax purposes are properly attributable to New York is fair and reasonable as applied to petitioner's three retail department stores within City of New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the authority of section 24-a of the General City Law, the City of New York imposes an excise tax for the privilege of carrying on business in the city.  The Comptroller prescribed a formula for allocation of that portion of the interstate transactions which for local tax purposes are properly attributable to New York (Administrative Code, &sect; B46-2.0, subd.  b).  The formula weighs into consideration the total property and total wages within and without the city deemed to have produced the interstate business; the amount of wholly taxable business (that done in intrastate transactions); the amount of wholly untaxed business (that done outside the State), and the allocable business (that done in interstate commerce emanating from the city).  The formula creates a percentage to be applied to allocable receipts and a limit of 66 2/3% is provided.  Petitioner owns three large department stores within the city, some of whose sales are made in New York for delivery in New Jersey and Connecticut.  The formula resulted in taxation of 45% to 48% of the receipts from allocable interstate business emanating from New York City in the calendar years from 1953 to 1958.  The impact of the formula on petitioner is fair and reasonable.  The formula offers a rough approximation of a just allocation.  Stores owned by petitioner in other States contribute nothing to the sales of the New York City stores of merchandise delivered to New Jersey and Connecticut, and the part played by petitioner's central headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio, is not shown to have large significance in a fair allocation of the basic activity which produced the sales.  The business of retail sales is a thing closely related to the place where a store is.  When sales are made, even to a customer who comes, calls or writes in from New Jersey or Connecticut, an activity in large part local exists.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner citizen appealed from a resettled order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which denied the citizen's application (1) to vacate an ex parte order granted to respondent state permitting (a) wire tapping of the citizen's telephone and (b) electronic eavesdropping of his office premises, and (2) to require disclosure of the order and affidavits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed an ex parte application for an order for eavesdropping. After obtaining the ex parte order, the state began wire tapping the citizen's telephone and electronic eavesdropping of his office premises. The citizen filed an application under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 5704(a) to vacate the ex parte order and disclose it and the affidavits. The appellate court denied the application. After initially granting the citizen leave to appeal, the court vacated that order and held that the appellate court should have dismissed the proceeding rather than have denied relief. The court found that the appellate court did not have jurisdiction to entertain the citizen's application because the ex parte order was criminal in nature. Therefore, the relief sought was not authorized pursuant to Rule 5704(a). Furthermore, there was no provision in the New York Code of Criminal Procedure permitting the citizen's application. Therefore, no review could be had.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed its earlier order granting the citizen leave to appeal the appellate court's denial of his application to vacate the ex parte order permitting the state to wiretap the citizen's telephone and electronically eavesdrop on the citizen and to require disclosure of the ex parte order and affidavits.</SPAN></P>

Penal Law &sect; 484(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence established that defendant allowed four children under the age of 18 years to congregate in her home where she gave them alcoholic beverages to drink.

On appeal, defendant claimed it was not the legislative intent to make criminal the service of alcoholic beverages to youngsters in the home of the person who served them. The court agreed with defendant, reversed the conviction, and dismissed the indictment. In reaching its decision, the court construed &sect; 484(3) and found that it could not reasonably be read as making criminal such dispensing of alcoholic beverages in the home. According to the court, &sect; 484(3) was intended to prohibit certain activities as to children when carried on in certain resorts or by people in certain kinds of business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Board of Elections of the City of New York, sought review of an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which modified and as modified affirmed a judgment in a N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 330 proceeding. The modification provided that the ballot contain eight columns, which included a line for an independent citizens party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The independent party candidates were also those candidates that were listed on the lines allocated to the republican and liberal parties. On review the court found that a reversal was warranted and that the supreme court's judgment should be reinstated. The court noted that N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 248 denied an additional independent column on the ballot to a candidate who already appeared thereon as the candidate of two major parties. That statute expressed a continuing legislative policy of preventing the major party candidates from pre-empting the whole ballot through the device of setting up independent political bodies. The court did not doubt the constitutionality of &sect; 248, but noted that in some particular situations it could not constitutionally be enforced because in those instances application would be unfair and prejudicial to a particular class of voters. There was no unconstitutional unfairness because the candidate who was demanding a third line would still have two lines and the other two major candidates would have two lines and one line respectively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proposed election was pursuant to a plan for apportioning and districting the state senate assembly. The supreme court granted judgment in favor of the senator and voters, and the appellate division modified by dismissing that cause of action.

The court ordered that, until an election of legislators under a valid districting plan, the presently sitting legislators should continue to sit, and to vote under an appropriate system of weighted voting. The court had to perform its sworn duty by preventing the holding of an election that violated the state constitution. The court held that neither the federal supremacy clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, nor the rules against interference with federal courts by state courts had any application, noting that, as to state questions the state courts were still empowered to control state elections.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the naturalized citizen obtained his status as a naturalized citizen of the United States, he attempted to register to vote for an upcoming election in New York City. The Commissioners refused to register him because he had not acquired citizenship at least 90 days prior to the election, as required by N.Y. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 and N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 150. In an action filed by the naturalized citizen challenging the 90-day requirement, the trial court found in favor of the naturalized citizen. However, on appeal, the court reversed and found that the requirement was reasonable, was in the power of the state to set voting qualifications, and did not infringe on a pre-empted field of federal legislation. The requirement also did not violate the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, which found unconstitutional a requirement that naturalized citizens who wished to vote had to acquire citizenship at least 90 days prior to the election.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff liquor wholesalers appealed a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a judgment in favor of defendant liquor authority, declaring constitutional and valid 1964 N.Y. Laws ch. 531, &sect;&sect; 7(3)(a), 9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A suit was brought by 62 liquor distillers and wholesalers, as well as some importers, seeking to overturn New York's restrictions on pricing for the industry. The court, however, affirmed the judgments below, finding no constitutional violations. The court noted first that the liquor industry had a long history of regulation, control, price fixing, place of time and sale setting, and outright extinction, and that it was too late to suggest that the liquor wholesalers' rights were the same as for those engaged in other industries. Thus, the court found no Equal Protection violations. The court then held that U.S. Const. amend. XXI gave the state the power to enact such price regulations and that the restrictions under &sect; 9 did not unconstitutionally burden interstate commerce. The court stated that, because the wholesalers could not sell in New York at a price below their lowest price elsewhere, the wholesalers could increase their prices elsewhere to compensate. The court further found that the schedule requirements contained in &sect; 7(3)(a), while broad, could be waived by the liquor authority in its discretion and, consequently, the statute did not have to be invalidated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Intoxicating liquors -- price setting -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> (L. 1964, ch.  531, &sect; 9) which provided that, on filing schedules of brand owners' prices to wholesalers, brand owner must file affirmation that bottle and case price to wholesalers in New York is no higher than lowest price at which such item of liquor was sold to any wholesaler elsewhere in country or any State or State agency operating public liquor enterprise, not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 9 of chapter 531 of the Laws of 1964 provided that, on filing the schedules of brand owners' prices to wholesalers, the brand owner or his designee must file an affirmation &quot;that the bottle and case price&quot; to wholesalers in New York &quot;is no higher than the lowest price at which such item of liquor&quot; was sold the previous month to any wholesaler elsewhere in the country or any State or State agency operating a public liquor enterprise.  This statute was adopted to take the place of section 101-c of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, which had authorized a manufacturer who was a &quot;brand&quot; owner to fix the minimum retail prices for that brand. The new statute is not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The State, particularly since the addition of the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution, could eliminate as well as regulate the liquor traffic within its borders. Therefore, if the statute makes it economically difficult for the liquor industry, it is within the competence of the State to make it that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A long history of regulation, control and outright extinction lies behind the liquor business in this country, and it is too late today to suggest that the rights of those who choose to engage in it are on a constitutional or legal parity with the rights of people who trade in other commodities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The conditions set down by the Legislature are not economically impossible for the liquor industry.  The effect of the statute will be to reduce liquor profits and pass the benefit of some of them on to New York consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In effect, the dependence of the New York price on the maximum price of the distiller for his brand elsewhere is to tie the price in this State to a national price.  This is not unreasonable nor an interference with interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. If the effect of the new statute is that the price in New York is too low, the distillers have it within their power to raise the lowest price elsewhere and thus control the base price.  The incidental effect on prices in another State does not invalidate the New York statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The statute is not in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act or the Robinson-Patman Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Section 7 of the statute requires that filed price schedules show the bottle and case price paid by a retailer and prohibits sale or purchase by a wholesaler unless schedules are filed by brand owners &quot;irrespective of the place of sale or delivery&quot;.  The statute is concerned with New York practices and, if the sales in other States have no relevancy to New York enforcement, the statute permits the Liquor Authority, for good cause, to waive the general prohibition against sales to wholesalers in the absence of such schedules.  It would be reasonable to expect that the statute would be administered consistently with its sole purpose to regulate the intrastate sale of liquor. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city council appealed by permission of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York) from a summary judgment order that unanimously affirmed an order declaring Local Law No. 1 of 1965 of the city to be unconstitutional, as it was found that the existing districting plan of the 13-member body offended the equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city council was made up of 13 members at the time of the suit. Each was elected by the inhabitants of one of the city's 13 wards and had the power to cast one vote, of equal weight with the others, on matters coming before the council. The city council enacted a Local Law that proposed the council would be reduced from 13 to seven members, each to be elected from one of seven districts, with certain of the less populous wards simply being incorporated into the new and larger districts. The population estimates employed by the council were obtained by up-dating the 1960 census figures, and by excluding the 3,217 persons who were patients in the state hospital. The court found that the approximations of increase and decrease of population by reason of population movement and other factors were at best estimates and were not to be accepted in lieu of the federal census. Even accepting the council's own population figures, significant population discrepancies existed between certain of the seven councilmanic districts, and no special considerations were called to the court's attention to rationally explain the patent discrepancies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order finding that the redistricting plan was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- municipal districts -- new districting plan adopted by Binghamton Common Council does not meet constitutional requirements -- &quot;one person, one vote&quot; principle applicable to municipal legislative bodies -- New York courts have jurisdiction -- latest official census must be employed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Following a determination that the existing districting plan for the City of Binghamton providing for a 13-member Common Council was unconstitutional, the Binghamton Common Council by Local Law No. 1 of 1965 adopted a new districting plan by which it was proposed that the Common Council be reduced from 13 to 7 members, each to be elected from one of seven districts.  The population of each of the new districts, as reflected in the 1960 Federal census, varied from 7,863 to 15,808.  The court at Special Term properly determined that this plan did not meet constitutional requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Even accepting defendants' own population figures arrived at by &quot;up-dating&quot; the 1960 census and excluding the patients at the State Hospital located within one of the districts, the population discrepancies are so great that the districting does not meet the constitutional requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The principle of &quot;one person, one vote&quot;, mandated by the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, is applicable to elective legislative bodies exercising general governmental powers at the municipal level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The courts of New York are vested with jurisdiction of actions brought to vindicate the right to equal representation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The latest official census must be employed in determining population for districting purposes.  The New York State Constitution (art. III, &sect; 4) makes the latest Federal census &quot;controlling as to the number of inhabitants in the State or any part thereof&quot; for purposes of State legislative apportionment. Numerous statutes also make that census the determinant whenever &quot;population&quot; is a factor to be taken into account.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged the judgments of the Supreme Court in New York County (New York), which were entered upon the jury's verdicts that convicted defendants of two counts of murder in the first degree and sentenced defendants to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants shot and killed two people. The court held that the convictions were proper. The court found that the change in N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1045-a was only procedural in that the current &sect; 1045-a allowed the jury to consider defendants' former crimes in determining defendants' sentences, whereas the former &sect; 1045-a only permitted the judge to consider such information. Thus, &sect; 1045-a was not ex post facto. The court also determined that relevant evidence, including the probation report, was admissible before the sentencing jury. The court also held that the trial court properly performed its obligation to charge the jury as to the law that related to the possible release on parole of a person sentenced to life imprisonment. The confessions of defendants were not required to be excluded because defendants were not previously informed of their right to counsel or that their statements could be used against them, because there was no request for representation by an attorney when defendants were interrogated by the police and there was no attorney who was refused admittance. However, the court held that a hearing on the voluntariness of defendants' confessions was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments of the trial court subject to hearings by the trial court on the voluntariness of defendants' confessions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- murder, first degree -- jury proceeding to determine sentence -- after defendants have been found guilty of murder in first</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> degree, proceeding may be conducted before jury to determine sentence, and nonlegal evidence may thereupon be presented as to circumstances and defendants' history (Penal Law, &sect; 1045-a, subd. 3), including their prior homicides and their other crimes; no burden of proof on either side; such procedural change not ex post facto -- court correctly instructed such sentencing jury that person who is sentenced to life imprisonment may be paroled after 26 years and 8 months (Penal Law, &sect; 1045-a, subd. 4; &sect; 1945, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">subd. 6; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Correction Law, &sect; 230</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 2) -- in murder trial proper, hearing should be held by Judge on voluntariness of defendants' confessions -- accordingly, judgments which were rendered on verdicts of death are modified to extent of directing hearing by Judge on voluntariness of defendants' confessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. After a trial has been completed and a verdict has been rendered of guilty of murder in the first degree, a proceeding may be conducted for a determination by the jury as to whether the sentence should be life imprisonment or death (Penal Law, &sect; 1045-a).  In such a proceeding, &quot;evidence may be presented by either party on any matter relevant to sentence including, but not limited to, the nature and circumstances of the crime, defendant's background and history, and any aggravating or mitigating circumstances. Any relevant evidence, not legally privileged, shall be received regardless of its admissibility under the exclusionary rules of evidence.&quot; (Penal Law, &sect; 1045-a, subd. 3.) This new statute merely changes the procedure.  Whatever evidence would have been relevant in the case of a probation report, or could be considered by a sentencing Judge, is properly admissible before the sentencing jury, including nonlegal evidence of prior homicides and other crimes of the defendants; and there is no burden of proof on either the prosecution or the defense.  This procedural change does not make this an unconstitutional ex post facto statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Subdivision 4 of section 1045-a of the Penal Law requires the court to charge the sentencing jury on &quot;the law relating to the possible release on parole of a person sentenced to life imprisonment.&quot; In this case, each of the two defendants had been found guilty on two counts of felony murder, since two victims had been killed.  The court (a) correctly instructed the sentencing jurors that, if they saw fit, they could direct life sentences on each count; (b) correctly refused to charge that they could recommend that such life sentences run successively rather than concurrently (cf.  Penal Law, &sect; 2188); and (c) correctly instructed the jurors that it is possible for a defendant who is sentenced to life imprisonment to be paroled after serving 26 years and 8 months (Penal Law, &sect; 1945, subd. 6; Correction Law, &sect; 230, subd. 2).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In the murder trial proper, it was not necessary to exclude defendants' confessions on the ground that the police had not previously informed the defendants of their right to counsel or that their statements could be used against them.  There was no request for representation by attorney when the defendants were interrogated by the police, nor was there an attorney in attendance who was refused admittance. However, a hearing should be held by the Judge on the voluntariness of the confessions, under the holding of the United States Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Jackson </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Denno</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (378 U.S. 368).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Accordingly, the judgments of conviction, which were rendered on the verdicts of death, are modified to the extent of directing a hearing on the issue of the voluntariness of the confessions which were introduced as a part of the People's case at the trial ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">People </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Huntley</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 15 N Y 2d 72), and, as so modified, affirmed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that this was a proceeding to review the determination of the comptroller imposing a compensating use tax upon a dredge and some pipe lines belonging to the taxpayer, a West Virginia corporation having its principal place of business in New York City. The taxpayer appealed on constitutional grounds. Despite the broad wording of the statute, the taxpayer contended that, because the tax was, in terms, based upon the &quot;consideration given&quot; for personal property, its sole purpose was to eliminate sales tax avoidance by imposing a use tax identical with the sales tax but only on property purchased outside the city and brought into the city within a reasonable period after purchase. However, the court held that in the light of other provisions of the use tax statute, it was clear that the tax was not based only upon the retail selling price to the taxpayer. The court further rejected the taxpayer's contention that the use tax was an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that a use tax did not hamper the transactions of interstate commerce or discriminate against them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- New York City compensating use tax -- foreign corporation with principal place of business in New York City bought personal property in another state and used it in other states for eight years, and then used it in New York City for six weeks, and then used it in another state; New York City Comptroller assessed compensating use tax on value, not on purchase price, of property thus used in city; order of Appellate Division confirming such determination affirmed -- since no other jurisdiction has imposed sales tax or use tax</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> on these items, there is no problem of burden of multiple taxation on interstate commerce -- tax for six weeks' use not unfair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A West Virginia corporation, which was engaged in the business of dredging rivers and harbors, had its principal place of business in New York City.  The corporation bought a certain dredge in Maryland, and used it for about eight years in South Carolina, Florida, and Virginia, then used it in New York City for about six weeks, and then moved it to Connecticut.  Its home port was designated at New York, N. Y., in its registration with the United States Coast Guard.  The corporation also employed within the city, in order to haul the dredged material, certain used pipe and pontoon line equipment which it had originally bought outside of the city.  The New York City Comptroller subsequently assessed against the corporation a compensating use tax of about $ 33,000, plus penalties and interest, based not on the original purchase price but on the value of the dredge and equipment which were used &quot;for any length of time&quot; within the city (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; M46-15.0, subd. 1; &sect; M46-28.0, subds. 1, 5; N. Y. City Sales and Use Tax Reg.,  art. 2 [F]; see, also, Administrative Code, &sect;&sect; M46-18.0, M46-19.0, M46-21.0).  An order of the Appellate Division confirming the City Comptroller's determination is affirmed.  The compensating use tax statute is intended not only to eliminate avoidance of the sales tax statute; it is also intended that the tax may be imposed on the use within the city of property purchased and long used elsewhere.  Furthermore, one of the purposes of a city use tax is to enable city retail sellers to compete on terms of equality with retail sellers in other states or cities who are exempt from a sales tax or any corresponding tax burden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Appellant corporation acknowledges that there is no evidence that any other jurisdiction has imposed a sales tax or a use tax on these items.  Hence this case presents no constitutional problem of the burden of multiple taxation on interstate commerce (cf. U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 8).  Nor is a tax for six weeks' use unfair. And, since such tax is not based solely on the purchase price, the corporation's arguments concerning legislative powers and equal protection of the laws are not relevant.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In three separate actions, one sounding in contract and two in tort, appellant foreign corporations challenged decisions of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in both the First Judicial Department and Third Judicial Department (New York), which determined that personal jurisdiction existed over appellants under the long arm statute,&nbsp;N.Y. C.P.L.R. 302.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In three cases under review, one sounding in contract and two in tort, the court was called upon to decide whether lower courts had acquired personal jurisdiction over appellant foreign corporations under the long arm statute,&nbsp;N.Y. C.P.L.R. 302. The court found that in the first action there was jurisdiction under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 302(a)(1) because appellant had transacted business in the state where there were substantial preliminary negotiations, actual execution of the supplementary contract took place in the state, and services were rendered in the state. The court found that in the second action appellant was not subject to jurisdiction under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 302(a)(2) because appellant did not commit a tortious act within the state. The court found that in the third action there was no jurisdiction on the ground that appellant committed a tortious act within the state, but jurisdiction existed on the ground that appellant transacted business within the state. In two of the three actions, the orders of the lower courts were affirmed and the certified questions answered in the affirmative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decisions in two of the three actions, holding that personal jurisdiction existed under the long arm statute over appellant foreign corporations transacting business within the state. The court reversed the decision in a third action, holding that there was no jurisdiction over appellant foreign corporation that did not commit a tortious act within the state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Process -- service on nonresidents -- &quot;long-arm&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CPLR 302</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) is procedural in nature and embraces suits commenced after its effective date based on previously accrued causes of action -- in action for damages for breach of warranty in connection with manufacture and sale of machines, foreign manufacturer's activities within state constituted &quot;[transaction of] any business within the state&quot; within </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CPLR 302</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> so as to give New York courts jurisdiction of manufacturer by service of process on it within foreign state -- in second action to recover damages for personal injuries and property damage resulting from explosion of tractor-drawn steel tank, jurisdiction was not obtained of foreign manufacturer of tank by service of process on it in foreign state since its improper assemblage of tank was &quot;tortious</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> act&quot; not committed &quot;within&quot; state -- in third action to recover damages sustained when geologist's hammer manufactured and labeled without state broke, jurisdiction of foreign manufacturer cannot be sustained on basis of &quot;tortious act&quot; committed &quot;within&quot; state -- but can be sustained on basis that manufacturer transacted business within state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The &quot;long-arm&quot; statute ( CPLR 302) which, effective September 1, 1963, granted jurisdiction to New York courts over a nondomiciliary who &quot;transacts any business within the state&quot; or &quot;commits a tortious act within the state&quot; embraces suits instituted after its effective date but based on previously accrued causes of action. Section 302 is of a procedural and remedial nature and thus applicable to actions thereafter instituted for the redress of wrongs already done.  It does not create new rights but merely facilitates the enforcement locally of pre-existing rights.  Moreover, CPLR 10003 states that the CPLR &quot;shall apply to all actions hereafter commenced&quot; whether based on previously or subsequently accrued causes of action. The retroactive application of CPLR 302 is constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action for damages for breach of warranty in the manufacture and sale of machines by a foreign corporation having its place of business in Chicago, personal jurisdiction of defendant was properly acquired by service upon it of a summons and complaint in Illinois, where defendant's activities within this State in connection with the sale included substantial preliminary negotiations through high-level personnel during a period of some two months; the actual execution of a supplementary contract; the shipment for use here, subject to acceptance following delivery, of two specially designed machines, priced at $ 118,000, and the rendition of services over a period of some three months by two of defendant's top engineers in supervising the installation and testing of the complex machines. Defendant's contacts with this State were such that the maintenance of the action does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a second action to recover damages for personal injuries and property damage resulting from the explosion in New York of a tractor-drawn steel tank manufactured in Kansas by a Kansas corporation, sold to a Missouri corporation which mounted it on a wheelbase and then in turn sold to a licensed interstate carrier in Pennsylvania whose agents were driving its tractor in this State when the tank exploded, personal jurisdiction was not obtained, pursuant to CPLR 302 (subd. [a], par. 2), of the Kansas corporation by service of a summons and complaint upon it in Kansas.  The Kansas corporation never transacted business in New York, and the tortious act charged against it -- that it improperly designed and assembled the tank -- occurred in Kansas.  The language of paragraph 2 conferring personal jurisdiction over a nondomiciliary if he &quot;commits a tortious act within the state&quot; cannot be read as synonymous with &quot;commits a tortious act without the state which causes injury within the state&quot;.  The occurrence of the injury in this State cannot serve to transmute an out-of-state tortious act into one committed here within the sense of the statutory wording.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Gray </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> American Radiator &amp; Sanitary Corp</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., 22 Ill. 2d 432, not followed.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a third action to recover damages for personal injuries sustained when a geologist's hammer manufactured in Illinois by an Illinois corporation which marked it &quot;unbreakable&quot;, and purchased for infant plaintiff in New York, broke in Connecticut, and damaged infant plaintiff's eye, personal jurisdiction of the manufacturer on the ground that it committed a tortious act within the State within CPLR 302 (subd. [a], par. 2) cannot be sustained.  The tortious acts of manufacturing and labeling the hammer occurred in Illinois and are insufficient to satisfy the requirement of paragraph 2 that the &quot;tortious act&quot; be one committed &quot;within&quot; this State.  That a product defectively manufactured and misleadingly labeled in one state is marketed and sold in another cannot serve to change the place where the original tortious acts were committed or to create a new tortious act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Jurisdiction of the Illinois manufacturer, however, can be sustained on the ground that it &quot;[transacted] * * * business within the state&quot; ( CPLR 302, subd. [a], par. 1) and that the pleaded cause of action is one &quot;arising&quot; therefrom.  Paragraph 1 is not limited to actions in contract and applies to tort actions when supported by a sufficient showing of facts.  Defendant shipped substantial quantities of its products into this State as the result of solicitation here through a local manufacturer's representative and through catalogues and advertisements and the injury-causing hammer, purchased from a New York dealer, was one of such products.  Defendant's activities in this State are sufficient to satisfy the statutory criterion of transaction of business as well as the constitutional requirement of minimum contacts.  It is not determinative that the formal execution of its sales contracts may have occurred in Illinois rather than New York.  Nor is it a controlling consideration that the actual injury happened to take place in Connecticut, since the cause of action asserted is clearly one &quot;arising from&quot; the purposeful activities engaged in by defendant in this State in connection with the sale of its products in the New York market.  </SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the orders. The court held as follows: (1) an award of costs to a successful appellant was governed by N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed an order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which entered judgment finding that defendants did not have any interest in the subject property because they failed to record their intent and declaration of reversionary interest in accordance with N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 345.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment finding that defendants were not vested with any reversionary right to reenter property where the condition requiring it to be used as a school facility was breached was reversed. The lower court found that because the intent and declaration of reversionary interest was not recorded in accordance with N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 345, defendant's right to renter the property was extinguished. On appeal, the court found that the statute as applied was unconstitutional. According to the court, &sect; 345 was unconstitutional as impairing the obligation of the contract contained in the deed, and depriving the reversioner of its property without due process of law. The court concluded that under the circumstances, &sect; 345 could not be sustained since it purported to bar the remedy before the right to enforce it had matured. Hence, the court determined that defendants had the right to reenter the property upon the breach of the contract provision prohibiting any use of the property other than for school purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in plaintiffs' favor and entered judgment finding that defendants had the right to reenter the property upon breach of the conditions of the deed.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- rights of reverter -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Real Property Law ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">&sect; 345</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 4</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">), insofar as it purports to extinguish rights of reverter unless owners of such rights shall record declarations of intent to preserve their rights before September 1, 1961, is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> and void as applied to reverter which did not mature until 1962 under 1854 deed which provided for reverter to grantor or his heirs if premises were no longer used for educational purposes -- grantor's heirs and devisees are entitled to judgment declaring that they are now vested with fee title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants' ancestor conveyed a parcel of land to plaintiff's predecessor by a deed which was recorded in 1854 and which stated: &quot;Provided nevertheless that the said lot and the building thereon shall be used for the purposes of an Academy and no other then this deed shall remain in full force and effect otherwise it shall become Void and the premises herein conveyed shall revert to the said John Townsend party of the first part and to his heirs.&quot; The land was used for educational purposes until April 1, 1962, when such use was discontinued.  Section 345 of the Real Property Law was enacted by chapter 865 of the Laws of 1958.  This statute states that conditions subsequent or special limitations restricting the use of land, and the rights of reverter created thereby, shall be extinguished unless the owners of such rights of reverter shall record declarations of intent to preserve their rights; and, if such condition subsequent or special limitation was created before September 1, 1931, such declaration must be recorded on or before September 1, 1961 (Real Property Law, &sect; 345, subd.  4).  But a right of reverter is a property right. In 1961 this land was still being used for educational purposes and the reversion would not mature or take effect in enjoyment until some indefinite future time.  As thus applied, this portion of subdivision 4 of section 345 is not a valid Statute of Limitations, since it purports to bar the remedy before the right of enforcement has matured; nor is it a valid recording act designed to protect innocent third-party purchasers for value, since it bars a property right as between the parties or their successors. This portion of subdivision 4 of section 345 of the Real Property Law is unconstitutional, since it impairs the obligation of contract and deprives the owners of their property without due process of law. The defendants are entitled to judgment declaring that they are vested with title in fee to the property, free from any claim of plaintiff thereto.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent state officers sought review of the order of the Supreme Court at Special Term (New York), which held the reapportionment statutes, 1964 N.Y. Laws 976, 977, 978, 979, 981, violated N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 2 because they called for an assembly of more than 150 members. Petitioner citizens cross-appealed from the portion of the order that held the statutes were not invalid by reason of their having been enacted at a special session.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature enacted five reapportionment statutes during an extraordinary session. The trial court held the reapportionment statutes unconstitutional on the sole ground that they called for an assembly of more than 150 members. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order. The court held that the flat, positive, and unmistakable command in N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 2 that there be 150 members of the state assembly was in full effect. Because each of the four plans violated that command, each plan and all five reapportionment statutes, 1964 N.Y. Laws 976, 977, 978, 979, 981, were invalid. The 150-member provision of N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 2 was separate and severable from the elaborate and complex formulae that the highest federal court struck down as violating the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. There was no showing that the highest federal court's mandate for equally populated districts could not be obeyed if the assembly districts numbered exactly 150. The court held that passage of reapportionment statutes at a special session was not forbidden.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order, which held that the reapportionment statutes violated the New York Constitution because they called for an assembly of more than 150 members and that the reapportionment statutes were not invalid on the ground that they were enacted at a special session.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- apportionment of Legislature -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> enacted at extraordinary session of Legislature which set up four plans for apportioning and districting State Senate and Assembly (L. 1964, chs. 976, 977, 978, 979, 981) are </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> since each establishes Assembly of more than 150 members and State Constitution (art. III, &sect; 2) states that &quot;The assembly shall consist</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> of one hundred and fifty members.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Statutes which were enacted at an extraordinary session of the Legislature and set up four separate plans for apportioning and districting the State Senate and Assembly (L. 1964, chs. 976, 977, 978, 979, 981) are unconstitutional since each establishes an Assembly of more than 150 members, whereas the State Constitution (art. III, &sect; 2) states that &quot;The assembly shall consist of one hundred and fifty members.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Neither the United States Supreme Court nor the Federal District Court in the litigation which resulted in holding the New York Legislature to be invalidly organized determined that the limitation of 150 members was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It is not and cannot be shown that the Supreme Court's mandate for equally populated districts could not be obeyed if the Assembly districts numbered 150.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The statutes were not invalid because passed at a special session of the Legislature and not at a regular session ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Matter of Reynolds</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 202 N. Y. 430, 443-444).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The unconstitutionality found by the United States Supreme Court relates almost entirely to the second paragraph of section 5 and to the provision in the first paragraph that each county, no matter how small, shall have an Assembly member.  There is no reason why the balance of section 5 should not be obeyed, especially its requirement that Assembly districts be &quot;compact * * * convenient and contiguous&quot;, and including so far as possible all the other directions in the fourth paragraph of section 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Section 3 of article III of the State Constitution, insofar as it delimits the Senate districts, is completely void.  Also, the apportionment and locating of Senate districts by the new statutes fall with the invalidated Assembly districting in the same statutes since the Constitution (art. III, &sect; 5) provides that the apportionment of Assembly districts and Senate districts must be &quot;by the same law&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The third paragraph of section 4 which permits the increase of State Senate districts above 50 is valid (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Matter of Fay</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 291 N. Y. 198) except that it is subject to the requirement that districts must be substantially equal in population.  The long full paragraph at the beginning seems still to be applicable except possibly the prohibitions in its last two sentences which should, however, be respected if it be mathematically possible so to do and still obey the &quot;one man, one vote&quot; basic rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The districting outlawed by the United States Supreme Court as well as all former districtings of this State use the county as the basic unit into which both Assembly and Senate districts are molded, but under the new rules the integrity of all the counties in these respects cannot be complete.  Not only will it be impossible to give each county at least one full Assembly district but also the boundaries of districts cannot in all instances be co-terminal with county borders.  Also, the fourth paragraph of section 5 of article III giving local legislatures the power to draw Assembly district lines in counties having more than one Assembly district cannot survive, since in some instances part of an Assembly district will have to be in one county and part in another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The redistricting should not be left to the Federal courts.  The Legislature is under an obligation to reapportion and the Federal courts intervene only as a last resort.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A witness testified at trial that defendants told him how they had killed the two police officers during a holdup. The witness's trial testimony was the same as a statement he had made to police eight months earlier. At trial, the witness declared that he made the statement to police only after he had been held in custody overnight and severely beaten and tortured and that he would not have talked to the police had they not coerced him in this manner. However, the witness insisted from the witness stand that the pretrial statement, which he made to the police, as well as his testimony, implicating defendants, was completely true. The court affirmed the convictions. The court found that while an out-of-court confession coerced from a defendant would be excluded from evidence, the testimony of a witness who, although previously forced to make a pretrial statement, asserted that his testimony at the trial was truthful, was for the consideration and appraisal of the jury. The requirements of law were met if the fact of such earlier coercion or other official lawlessness was disclosed to the jurors so that they could pass upon the witness's veracity and credibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent lienor filed an action against appellant owner to enforce a mechanic's lien. The trial court voided the lien because it had been willfully exaggerated. The trial court did not award any civil penalty for willful exaggeration to the owner under N.Y. Lien. Law. &sect; 39-a because the owner did not request such relief. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) affirmed, and the owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court voided the mechanic's lien because it was willfully exaggerated to some extent, but it made no finding to show what items were willfully exaggerated or by how much. The owner argued that N.Y. Lien. Law 39-a entitled it to an automatic recovery of the entire amount of the discrepancy between the amount of the lien as filed and the amount found due. The court disagreed with the owner's approach and concluded that the intent of the legislature was to provide a civil penalty for only the amount of the wilful exaggeration. The court pointed out that the owner, as the party aggrieved by the lien, had the burden to prove the amount of the wilful exaggeration. The court then noted that the trial court's findings indicated that the lien contained willful exaggeration but that the exact number of items willfully exaggerated and the extent of the exaggeration was not determined nor was any request for such findings made. The court determined that the trial court's finding of willful exaggeration entitled the owner to a civil penalty but that additional findings of fact as to the amount and extent of the exaggeration were necessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's judgment and remanded the case to the trial court to make findings on the evidence or on new evidence to be taken to establish the extent of the civil penalty owed to the owner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Liens -- mechanic's lien -- willful exaggeration of lien -- statutory provision (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Lien Law, &sect; 39-a</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) that owner or contractor recover civil penalty when lien is declared void for willful exaggeration (&sect; 39) was intended to allow only recovery of amount of such willful</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> exaggeration and not necessarily of entire difference between amount of lien as filed and sum actually due lienor; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> if held to impose penalty measured by discrepancy due to honest mistake, might be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> trial court found existence but not extent of willful exaggeration and Court of Appeals lacks power to make new findings of fact thereon, so matter is remanded to trial court to make findings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 39-a of the Lien Law provides that an owner or contractor may recover damages when a mechanic's lien is declared void for willful exaggeration (&sect; 39), and that such damages &quot;shall include * * * an amount equal to the difference by which the amount claimed to be due or to become due as stated in the notice of lien exceeded the amount actually due or to become due thereon.&quot; Such literal language is to be read in conjunction with the immediately preceding sentence in section 39-a providing for recovery only where &quot;the court shall have declared said lien to be void on account of wilful exaggeration&quot; in which event &quot;the person filing such notice of lien shall be liable in damages to the owner or contractor.&quot; The draftsman of the statute evidently had chiefly in mind the situation where the entire amount of the exaggeration was willful, and the Legislature intended to allow recovery of this civil penalty only in the amount by which the lien was thus exaggerated. An owner is not entitled to recover anything on account of an honest mistake.  Accordingly, when a mechanic's lien filed in the amount of $ 22,804.68 was declared void on the grounds that the amount actually due was but $ 9,380.89 and that there had been some willful exaggeration, but the extent thereof was not determined, automatic recovery of the penalty in the amount of the entire $ 13,423.79 discrepancy cannot be had.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. If section 39-a were held to impose a penalty measured by a discrepancy due to honest mistake, it might well be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Although the answer did not ask for any affirmative relief, except attorneys' fees incurred in obtaining discharge of the lien, such failure to demand this statutory civil penalty should be overlooked inasmuch as the issue was litigated of whether the lien was willfully exaggerated by some amount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Court of Appeals lacks power to make new findings of fact on conflicting evidence which could have been made by the trial court or the Appellate Division by determining how much of the discrepancy found was willful. In the absence at the trial court of a request for, or the making of, findings as to the amount of the willful exaggeration, the case should be remanded to the trial court to make the findings.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The passenger, a California resident, was injured when the foreign airline's plane crashed in Sudan. The passenger brought a negligence action against the foreign airline in New York City because the foreign airline maintained a ticket office in New York City. The trial court denied the foreign airline's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to article 28 of the Warsaw Convention. The foreign airline appealed. The appellate division reversed the order and dismissed the complaint. The passenger appealed. The court reversed the order of the appellate division because, under article 28 of the Warsaw Convention, the foreign airline had a place of business in New York City in its ticket office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- jurisdiction -- Warsaw Convention -- action by plaintiff, California resident, to recover for injuries sustained in crash in Sudan of airplane operated between Jerusalem and Cairo by defendant, foreign airline, will lie in courts of New York where defendant maintained place of business, ticket office, although plaintiff arranged for passage on defendant's plane with Oakland, California, office of another airline -- provision in Warsaw Convention that such action must be brought in territory of one of high contracting parties, either before court of carrier's domicile or of his principal place of business,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> or where he has place of business through which contract was made, or before court at place of destination, when interpreted to effectuate obvious purpose of contracting powers, did not exclude suit in particular area if carrier had office there and ticket had been purchased in that area or in another part of territory of high contracting party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provision in the Warsaw Convention (art. 28) that an action for damages must be brought, at the plaintiff's option, &quot;in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, either before the court of the domicile of the carrier or of his principal place of business, or where he has a place of business through which the contract has been made, or before the court at the place of destination&quot; was apparently intended to limit bringing suits to only those forums where the terms of the Convention were in force and would be applied.  Moreover, the intent was to avoid suits in countries where the carrier had no office for the making of transportation contracts and where no passage on the carriers' aircraft had been purchased.  However, the carriers cannot, by changing their ticket routing methods, deprive purchasers of tickets in a territory of a high contracting party, where the carrier has an office, of access to courts in that jurisdiction as that would conflict with the basic intent that the remedy for passengers similarly situated was to remain constant.  Accordingly, an action will lie in the courts of New York against defendant, a foreign airline which maintains a place of business -- a ticket office -- in New York City, although plaintiff, a California resident, arranged for her air passage to several countries in Europe with the Oakland, California, office of another foreign airline which, in turn, obtained for her a ticket on defendant's flight from Jerusalem to Cairo in the course of which she was injured when the aircraft crashed while attempting a nonscheduled stop in the Sudan.  When the defendant opened its United States office in New York, it anticipated that it would be amenable to suits there for claims arising out of any carriage sold by that office, and the chance circumstance of where the plaintiff made her purchase of the ticket within this territory of a high contracting party should not relieve the defendant airline of the burden of litigation here when it expects to defend suits on similar contracts originating in its New York office.  An authorized venue is provided when there is a place of business in the territory and the sale of a ticket is closed within the territory. Such an application of the treaty parallels its express provisions and does not contradict them.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant permission to appeal an order of the Appellate Division, First Department (New York), which affirmed the trial court's order denying defendant's motion to suppress and convicting him of carrying a concealed weapon in violation N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1897.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While investigating another matter, police officers took defendant into a squad car, spoke to him about the other matter, and frisked him. The frisk led to the discovery of a loaded firearm concealed in defendant's brief case. At trial, defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained from his briefcase. The appellate court affirmed the conviction. On appeal, defendant argued that, absent a showing of the &quot;other matter,&quot; no probable cause existed for an arrest, absent which the search of his brief case was illegal and the fruits thereof unavailable as evidence against him. Defendant further argued that the officers' actions during the frisk were unreasonable under U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court affirmed, holding that disclosure of the &quot;other matter&quot; was unnecessary in light of proof that defendant and others had been under surveillance for months and that, under all the circumstances, the inclusion of the brief case in the &quot;frisk&quot; was not so unreasonable as to be constitutionally illegal. The court noted that the gun was &quot;concealed&quot; under &sect; 1897. The court found it unnecessary to consider whether the arrest prior to the search of the brief case was unlawful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- unlawful search and seizure -- examination of defendant's brief case as part of &quot;frisk&quot; was not unreasonable and constitutionally illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The New York City Police Department had been investigating defendant as to his complicity and connection with &quot;another matter&quot;.  Two police officers asked defendant to accompany them and, with an officer on either side, he was escorted to a parked squad car where they were joined by a third officer. One officer entered the rear seat of the squad car followed by the defendant and another officer.  The third officer entered the front seat at the right of the driver.  The officers seated on either side of defendant in the rear seat proceeded to &quot;frisk&quot; the defendant.  Defendant put a brief case which he had been holding on his lap on the car floor between his feet.  The officers completed the &quot;frisk&quot; after which defendant picked up the brief case and placed it on his lap. One of the officers then took the brief case and examined it and found a gun in it.  The finding of the gun resulted from a permissible &quot;frisk&quot; and not from an unreasonable search.  Under all the circumstances the inclusion of the brief case in the &quot;frisk&quot; was not so unreasonable as to be constitutionally illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. For purposes of the trial on the charge of carrying a concealed weapon, the disclosure of the &quot;other matter&quot; was unnecessary in light of proof that the defendant and four others had been under surveillance for several months; that a police officer had fraternized with the defendant for the purpose of procuring information as to his complicity and participation in the &quot;other matter&quot; and that he was, in fact, being taken to a police station for further questioning. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner sought to consolidate the city school district and the common school district.

However, the commissioner refused to recognize the rescission and proceeded with the consolidation. Appellees brought an action to have the consolidation order declared null and void. The trial court refused appellees' request. The appellate court reversed, holding that the common school district was entitled to rescind its consent to consolidation. Appellants sought review, and the court affirmed. The court agreed that under N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2021(14), the common school district was entitled to repeal its prior decision. Further, the court said, the commissioner acted arbitrarily as a matter of law when he effectively ignored the common school district's right to rescind and ordered consolidation.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to section 1524 of the Education Law, at a school district meeting of Common School District No. 18, a motion was adopted favoring consolidation of this district and the City School District of the City of Middletown. Thereafter, the Board of Education of the Middletown School District adopted a resolution consenting to the consolidation. On June 25, 1963, at a time when he had information that a special meeting was to be held in an effort to exercise the district's power to rescind the consolidation, the State Commissioner of Education issued an order of consolidation effective July 1, 1963.  On June 28, 1963 School District No.  18 rescinded its previous action in favor of consolidation. Subdivision 14 of section 2021 of the Education Law provides that, at a school district meeting duly assembled, those entitled to vote shall have power by a majority of those present and voting &quot;To alter, repeal and modify their proceedings, from time to time, as occasion may require.&quot; The State Commissioner of Education acted arbitrarily, as a matter of law, in refusing to withdraw his consolidation order when the district meeting had rescinded its action before the Commissioner's order became effective. </SPAN></P>

The court found that the question of constitutionality hinged upon its application to minors under 18 years of age. The court found that the statute made no distinction that it was addressed to minors under 18 years of age. Defendants had not been convicted of selling an obscene book to a minor, but one that was principally devoted to descriptions of illicit sex or sexual immorality, unrelated to whether the book was obscene. The court found that the statute was drawn so broadly as to render criminal sales or other exhibition to the young of pictures and publications of all kinds that were principally devoted to these subjects, in however serious or dignified a manner. The statute was so broad and so obscure in its coverage as to abridge the constitutionally protected freedom of speech and of the press as well as the due process clauses in the federal and state constitutions.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Section 484-h of the Penal Law prohibits the sale to a minor under 18 years of age of &quot;any book * * * the cover or content of which exploits, is devoted to, or is principally made up of descriptions of illicit sex or sexual immorality&quot;.  The statute is in violation of the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by denying due process of law in that the language is too vague for a criminal statute and it abridges freedom of speech and the press.  Accordingly, the judgment convicting defendants under that statute for the sale to a minor under 18 years of age of a copy of a book entitled &quot;Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure&quot; (&quot;Fanny Hill&quot;) should be reversed and the information dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff applicants brought an action against defendants, university and others, seeking a declaration that N.Y. Educ. Law art. 148 was unconstitutional and an injunction to restrain defendants from carrying out the statute's provisions. The Supreme Court, Nassau County (New York) dismissed the complaint. The applicants appealed from the order of the Supreme Court, Appellate Division (New York) that affirmed the supreme court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants practiced landscape architecture and were denied a license under the &quot;grandfather clause&quot; in N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 7323(3). They contended that the statute constituted an invalid exercise of the state's police power and an improper delegation of legislative power. The court affirmed the appellate court's order that affirmed the supreme court's dismissal of the applicants' complaint, as the regulation of landscape architects was a valid exercise of state police power and the statute did not improperly delegate legislative power. The court found that the regulation and practice of landscape architecture were clearly related to the public health and welfare. The court concluded that the legislature could properly give a board of examiners discretion in determining what constituted the &quot;substantial equivalent&quot; of a doctoral degree, as well as to determine what constituted &quot;satisfactory supervised experience,&quot; in passing upon the applicants' qualifications for professional preferment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Article 148 of the Education Law provides for the licensing of landscape architects, prohibits the unlicensed practice of landscape architecture after July 1, 1961, establishes a Board of Examiners to carry out the licensing provisions of the statute, prescribes penal sanctions for the violations of said statutes, and defines the practice of landscape architecture. It also provides that the article shall not be construed to affect or prevent the practice of engineering and other listed occupations, and that no persons shall use the designations landscape architect, landscape architectural or landscape architecture unless licensed under the provisions of the article.  The testimony at the trial established that the regulation of practice of landscape architecture, a profession in this State, was clearly related to public health and welfare and, as such, constituted a valid exercise of the police power. The article is not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although the language of section 7320 of the Education Law, defining the activities of one engaged in landscape architecture, standing alone and without more, might be regarded as too general, when it is read together with section 7326 which explicitly states that the article shall not be construed to prevent practice by licensed engineers, architects and other licensees, and also exempts from its operation a long list of designated occupations and activities, a sufficiently clear standard of conduct is set forth to give fair notice to one concerned with or engaged in the activities regulated as to what acts are criminal and those that are innocent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The statute does not constitute an improper delegation of legislative power. Board of Examiners are the usual and ordinary bodies to pass on the qualifications for professions and the board is properly given some discretion in satisfying itself as to the sufficiency of the grade and character of an applicant.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff chiropractors appealed an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed an order of the trial court granting a motion to dismiss by defendant Commissioner of Education of the State of New York (commissioner). The chiropractors filed the action, challenging N.Y. Educ. Law art. 132 as unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature enacted article 132, which added new requirements for the obtaining a chiropractic license, such as an examination in basic subjects and proficiency in the use of an X ray machine. The chiropractors filed a class action, alleging that the statute created unconstitutional distinctions as between groups of chiropractors and between chiropractors and other groups licensed to practice in the field of human health. The trial court granted the commissioner's motion to dismiss and on appeal, the appellate court and the court affirmed. The court found that article 132 was a valid exercise of the police power in furtherance of the public health. The court determined that because X rays related the chiropractic field, it was neither unreasonable nor inappropriate to require applicants to demonstrate a proficiency in that area. The court determined that the imposition of new requirements for the continued practice of a profession previously carried on without the need of such requirements did not violate the constitution. The court noted that grandfather clauses were common incidents of licensing and a reasonable basis on which to exempt experienced chiropractors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the appellate court, which affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the chiropractors' claim.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- practice of chiropractic -- article 132 of Education Law, enacted for licensing of practice of chiropractic, is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- no denial of equal protection of law -- provisions requiring examination in use and effect of X ray not violative of equal protection clause -- requirements of examination in basic subjects within area of police power -- Legislature could excuse some, under grandfather clause, and not others from passing basic subject test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Article 132 of the Education Law (L. 1963, chs. 780-781, eff. July 1, 1963) enacted for the licensing of the practice of chiropractic in New York State is not unconstitutional.  In enacting these provisions there was no denial of the equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The need to regulate and confine the use of X ray to qualified personnel has already been upheld in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Chiropractic Assn. of N. Y. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Hilleboe</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (12 N Y 2d 109). Since the use of X ray relates to a field where chiropractors will be practicing, it is neither unreasonable nor inappropriate to require chiropractic license applicants to demonstrate a proficiency in that area.  The provisions requiring an examination in the use and effect of X ray are not violative of the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The requirements of the statute for examination in the basic subjects pursuant to section 6552 of the Education Law do not render the statute unconstitutional.  The practice of chiropractic is connected with human health and within the area of the State's police power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Legislature could excuse, under a grandfather clause, some and not others from passing the basic subject test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The statute has conferred on chiropractors privileges which they could not claim as a matter of constitutional right, and this in itself meets the challenge that the statute is unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A village ordinance authorized the village Building Inspector to &quot;enter any building or premises at any reasonable hour&quot; in discharging his duty to &quot;enforce the provisions of&quot; the Village Building Zone Ordinance and provided that a violation constituted disorderly conduct with a prescribed punishment.  An injunction had been issued against the corporation,  of which defendant was president, from carrying on the business or professional activity in which he was engaged -- designing furniture, fabrics, wall coverings and similar materials -- in an area zoned for residential use.  On three occasions the village Building Inspector entered the premises and made observations after he got in, and these observations were the basis of three criminal prosecutions against defendant for violations of the ordinance. The convictions were the result of an unlawful search of defendant's home, and the judgment affirming the convictions is reversed and the informations dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent executrix sought review of the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed an order of a surrogate's court that vacated the executrix' demand for a jury trial in a proceeding for a compulsory accounting in connection with petitioner lawyers' claim against the estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the husband of the executrix died, a law firm of lawyers filed a claim against the estate for legal professional services claimed to have been rendered to the husband during his lifetime. The executrix rejected the claim and, almost six years later, the lawyers sought a compulsory accounting. The executrix, in response to the lawyers' petition, filed an affidavit in which she advised the surrogate's court that there were no claims pending against the estate other than the lawyers' claim and that she objected to an accounting. A copy of the affidavit served on the lawyers noted a demand for trial by jury. The lawyers orally moved to vacate the demand for a jury trial on the ground that the executrix was not entitled to a jury trial as a matter of right. The surrogate held that the executrix had no right to a jury trial even as a matter of discretion and accordingly vacated the jury demand. The appellate court affirmed. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the lawyers' claim was an action at law for work, labor, and services, and that the right to trial by jury in all such cases was preserved by U.S. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the denial of the executrix' request for a jury trial in the action for compulsory accounting to settle the lawyers' claim for legal fees because the claim made was an action at law to which a jury trial was guaranteed by the Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Sometime after testatrix rejected a claim made by a firm of lawyers for fees and disbursements for legal professional services claimed to have been rendered to testator during his lifetime, claimants filed a petition for a compulsory accounting by the executrix. The executrix filed an affidavit in which she stated that there was no necessity for an accounting other than this claim, and that she was willing to agree to a trial of the claim provided &quot;all of my defenses against the claim and my other rights, both substantive and procedural, in relation thereto are preserved.&quot; About two months later she served a duplicate copy of the affidavit and, for the first time, noted thereon that she demanded a trial by jury.  The Surrogate stated that he would deem the affidavit to be the executrix' answer.  The executrix had a right to a trial by jury and it should not have been denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioners' claim is at law for work, labor and services, and the right to trial by jury in all such cases is preserved by the Constitution (art.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The executrix did not waive the right to a jury trial. Section 67 of the Surrogate's Court Act provides that a right to trial by jury as to any issue of fact shall be deemed waived unless demanded in writing and served with the answer or objections.  The affidavit filed by executrix in opposition to the petitioners' motion for a compulsory accounting was not an &quot;answer&quot; or &quot;objections&quot;.  The executrix was not asserting any issue of fact on the merits of the claimants' purported legal services but was requesting, rather, that whatever issue might arise should be tried without burdening the estate with the expenses of an accounting. Moreover, the argument that there was a waiver was not made before the Surrogate, and was asserted for the first time in the Appellate Division, which properly disregarded it.  </SPAN></P>

A multiple dwelling having become so deteriorated that a nuisance exists therein which endangers life, health or safety, and notices to remove such nuisance having been served on the owner and the mortgagee, and a full hearing having been afforded thereon to the owner and the mortgagee, Special Term of the Supreme Court properly appointed the Commissioner of Real Estate of the City of New York as the receiver of the rents, issues and profits of the premises, for the purpose of removing or remedying the conditions constituting such nuisance (Multiple Dwelling Law, &sect; 309, as amd. by L. 1962, ch. 492).</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the appellate court's judgment that the zoning plan did not violate &sect; 3201. The zoning plan excluded no one from any school and had no tendency to foster or produce racial segregation. Also, the school board had express statutory power to select a site for a new school and to determine the school where each pupil was to attend, pursuant to N.Y. Educ.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

The first zoning map for the new school was rejected by the Board of Education because of the failure so to draw the zone as to prevent any measure of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">de facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> segregation of negro and Puerto Rican students.  Under that plan the enrollment would have been 52% negro, 34% Puerto Rican and 14% non-Puerto Rican white.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees were a part of a national strike against the employer. The national strike ended, but local strikes continued until dates when each local negotiation concluded. The employees sought unemployment benefits from the time when their strike ended until they were recalled. The court modified the lower court's order that reversed the determination of the board allowing the employees to collect such unemployment. The court found that delays caused by lack of parts and supplies from other idle plants were no part of the termination of a controversy in an establishment that had settled its own controversy. Denial of benefits was strictly limited to the geographic location of the employment even if the industry was highly integrated nationwide. The court upheld the lower court's affirmance of the board's determination that three plants who shared a tract of land should be considered one for purposes of the controversy on the principle that great weight should be given to the board's application of law to facts. Finally, the court rejected the employer's proposal that a strike in one plant should constitute a strike in any affected unit as contrary to the language of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A nationwide strike against General Motors Corporation called on October 2, 1958 was ended within 24 hours by a national settlement which, however, allowed local unions to continue strikes as to local issues. Thereafter, on various days between October 5 and October 28, settlements were reached and ratified at five General Motors plants in New York State, but full employment therein was not resumed until some time thereafter due to a lack of parts from other plants still on strike.  Claimants, employees at the five plants, were entitled to unemployment insurance benefits from the date of the local settlement in each claimant's plant to the date of his recall to employment.  The Labor Law ( &sect; 592, subd. 1) suspends benefits to a claimant losing employment because of an industrial controversy &quot;in the establishment in which he was employed&quot;.  However, it cannot be said that the several plants involved in this case constituted a single establishment (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Matter of Ferrara</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Catherwood</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">], 10 N Y 2d 1, followed) or that claimants' unemployment was not involuntary because they should have foreseen the consequences of idleness in some of the 124 plants of this integrated industrial enterprise.  Accordingly, if the controversy in one establishment was terminated, unemployment continuing therein due to lack of essential supplies or parts from another establishment idle because of an industrial controversy qualified for benefits under subdivision 1 of section 592.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board determined that the motor plant, the forge, and the foundry at Tonawanda constituted one establishment. The three divisions, although represented by different local unions under different bargaining agreements, occupied a single 150-acre tract within a single fence.  Although their administrative structure seems to tend toward separateness, the controlling decision is the holding in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Matter of Ferrara</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Catherwood</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) that geographic unity is the primary and ordinarily controlling factor in determining the existence of an &quot;establishment&quot; under the statute, and, therefore, the board's determination must be left undisturbed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The national collective bargaining agreement between General Motors and the international union stated that an authorized strike in one bargaining unit which interrupted the flow of material or service to any other unit should be considered an authorized strike in the affected unit.  Such provision cannot override the policy of the statute and the statutory definition of the class entitled to benefits and of the conditions under which they are due means an actual settlement within a given establishment regardless of what the national agreement considers to be an authorized strike.  The sustenance due the unemployed is not a fit subject of private waiver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Such statute, pre-existing the formation of the collective bargaining agreement and limiting its effectiveness, did not unconstitutionally impair contract obligations.  Likewise, the statute did not violate the supremacy clause by invalidly regulating interstate commerce. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff transporters appealed an order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which reversed a decision that had granted summary judgment in favor of the transporters. The transporters' complaint was also dismissed, and a finding was made that defendant State Liquor Authority of the State of New York (Authority) conformed with N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect; 102(1)(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The transporters held permits issued by the Authority for carrying alcohol within the state and delivered alcohol to residents who purchased it for their own personal use. The Authority determined such deliveries violated &sect; 102(1)(c). The transporters sought a declaration that they were entitled to such deliveries and an injunction to restrain the Authority from interfering in the deliveries. The Authority acknowledged that the transporters could deliver the alcohol once it reached the state but alleged that the transporters could not deliver the alcohol into the state. The court found that &sect; 102(1)(c) applied to those who were engaged in the liquor business, not to those who purchased liquor for their own use. The court determined that the activity the Authority sought to proscribe was specifically authorized by N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect; 116(c). The court indicated that the Authority's interpretation had little, if any, impact on the promotion of temperance. The court concluded that residents who purchased alcohol for their own use were entitled to enlist the services of the transporters to deliver the alcohol to them.</SPAN></P>

The court held (1) the tax was not a tax on real estate within the sense of the constitutional provision because it was imposed not on real estate but on lessees of real estate or on those who acquired lesser rights to use someone else's real estate for business or commercial activity, (2) the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution could not be availed of to condemn the statute because the imposition of the tax was not motivated by any other purpose than the raising of revenue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- New York City Commercial Rent or Occupancy Tax Law -- New York City Commercial Rent or Occupancy Tax Law (L. 1963, ch. 257; Local Laws, 1963, No. 38 of City of New York) is constitutional -- said tax is not tax on real estate -- consequently no violation of New York State Constitution (art. VIII, &sect; 10) -- tax is not ad valorem tax nor imposed on &quot;intangible personal property&quot; nor imposed &quot;because of ownership or possession&quot; of intangible personal property (N. Y. Const., art. XVI, &sect; 3) -- no violation of due process or equal protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The New York City Commercial Rent or Occupancy Tax Law (L. 1963, ch.  257; Local Laws, 1963, No. 38 of City of New York) is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The enabling act (L. 1963, ch. 257) authorizes the City of New York to impose a tax, such as the State Legislature could impose, &quot;on persons occupying premises in such city for the purpose of carrying on or exercising any trade, business, profession, vocation or commercial activity, measured by the rent paid for the use or occupancy of such premises&quot;.  The city enacted Local Law No. 38 for the year 1963 imposing the authorized tax, and defining &quot;taxable premises&quot; (&sect; L46-1.0, subd. 5) as &quot;Any premises in the city occupied, used, or intended to be occupied or used for the purpose of carrying on or exercising any trade, business, profession, vocation or commercial activity, including any premises so used even though it is used solely for the purpose of renting, or granting the rights to occupy or use, the same premises in whole or in part to tenants&quot;.  Section 10 of article VIII of the State Constitution applying to a &quot;tax on real estate&quot; limits the amount to be raised by such a tax to a percentage &quot;of the average full valuation of taxable real estate&quot; of the city.  If the tax under consideration is one imposed on real estate, adding it to the tax already imposed on assessed valuation would admittedly result in a total tax which would exceed the limit permitted by the Constitution.  It is not, however,  a tax on real estate within the sense of the constitutional provision. It is not imposed on real estate nor on owners of real estate. It is imposed on lessees of real estate or on those who acquire lesser rights to use someone else's real estate for business or other commercial activity. A leasehold is personal property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Section 3 of article XVI of the State Constitution provides that &quot;Intangible personal property shall not be taxed ad valorem nor shall any excise tax be levied solely because of the ownership or possession thereof&quot;.  The tax here involved is not an ad valorem tax but, even if it were, it would be one on a leasehold which is not &quot;intangible personal property&quot; within the sense of the constitutional provision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Similarly, there is no violation of that part of section 3 of article XVI which provides that no excise tax &quot;shall * * * be levied solely because of the ownership or possession&quot; of intangible personal property. The tax does not apply to mere ownership or possession.  It applies only when the leased premises are used for commercial purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. It is not a violation of due process or equal protection to levy a tax on tenants engaged in commercial activities without levying it on owners who engage in such activities on their own premises, nor is it violative of the constitutional provisions to distinguish between tenants paying an annual rent of $ 2,500 or less and those paying more.  </SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the State of New York was under no duty to provide a forum for defendant to attack his foreign conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord argued that its constitutional rights were infringed when it had not been permitted to use as the valuation base the assessed value of its property as equalized and adjusted upward to or toward &quot;actual&quot; value under the New York City Local Rent Control Law, New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; Y41-5.0(g) (1962). The Administrator argued that there was no substantial constitutional question. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that dismissal was proper because while the assessment of the landlord's property may not have been equal to its true value, the same may have been said with equal force of the assessments outside New York City which, were validly adjusted for rent control purposes by use of an equalization. The court ruled that an equalization rate had not purported to measure the ratio of assessed valuation to full value of any individual property. Section Y41-5.0(g) provided for a rent increase if a landlord was earning less than 6 percent of the value of his property, with &quot;value&quot; having been defined as assessed value in effect at the time the application was filed. The court concluded that state rent control laws used equalized assessment values.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An indictment which charged defendants with the crime of contempt of court (Penal Law, &sect; 600, subd. 7) for publishing an allegedly false statement made by a person in a judicial proceeding that a named police officer had beaten him and knocked him to the ground should be dismissed.  Under the statute, the false or grossly inaccurate publication must intentionally assail the dignity and authority of the court.  The indictment does not allege an intent to make a false or grossly inaccurate publication or to deny the dignity and authority of the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. While ordinarily an indictment in the language of the statute is not susceptible to demurrer on its face, the rule is not fixed and invariable where circumstances dictate otherwise.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the taxpayer's class action suit in which he sought to find the Pari-Mutuel Revenue Law unconstitutional where it resulted in granting $ 42,000,000 to respondent racetrack.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer sought to obtain a judgment declaring that the Pari-Mutuel Revenue Law was an unconstitutional misappropriation of taxpayers' funds where its effect was to grant an additional $ 42,000,000 to a racetrack. The trial court dismissed the taxpayer's complaint for lack of standing, and the lower court affirmed. On further appeal, the court adhered to the rule of law that held that New York state courts denied the right of a taxpayer to bring before a court for review the acts of another department of government simply because that taxpayer was one of many such citizens and taxpayers. The only other state to adhere to that rule of law was New Mexico. The taxpayer had argued that the constitution was a people's document, and the hypothesis that a taxpayer held no &quot;interest&quot; in state expenditures was little more than a legal fiction. In affirming, the court concluded that it could not be squared with the generally accepted doctrine that a taxpayer on the municipal level, where the issues were rarely of comparable importance, did possess the requisite direct and immediate interest to warrant his bringing an action to challenge the expenditure of municipal funds.</SPAN></P>

Defendants claimed that the ordinance, as applied to them, was an unconstitutional interference with U.S. Const. amend. I and V. The court held that the ordinance was a proper exercise of police power because it did not impose an arbitrary standard of beauty or conformity on the community, nor did it cause undue hardship to defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendants' convictions, holding that, as the ordinance did not impose arbitrary or capricious standards on the community and caused no undue hardship to defendants, it was a constitutional exercise of plaintiff's police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- ordinance prohibiting clotheslines -- constitutional law -- defendants properly convicted of violation of ordinance prohibiting erection and maintenance of clothesline in front or side yard abutting street -- ordinance valid as attempt to preserve residential appearance of city and property values by banning unsightly clotheslines -- ordinance not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> infringement of freedom of speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  In 1956 defendants placed a clothesline, filled with old clothes and rags, in the front yard of their home as a form of &quot;peaceful protest&quot; against the high taxes imposed by the city.  During each of the five succeeding years, defendants added another clothesline.  The city enacted an ordinance prohibiting the erection and maintenance of clotheslines or other devices for hanging clothes or other fabrics in a front or side yard abutting a street, but provided for the issuance of a permit for the use of such clotheslines if there is &quot;a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship in drying clothes elsewhere on the premises&quot;.  An application by the owner of the property for such a permit was denied.  Judgments convicting defendants of violation of the ordinance were properly affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The ordinance may be sustained as an attempt to preserve the residential appearance of the city and its property values by banning, insofar as practicable, unsightly clotheslines from yards abutting a public street. Although based on what may be termed aesthetic considerations, it prescribes conduct which offends sensibilities and tends to debase the community and reduce real estate values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The ordinance is not invalid as applied to defendants as an unconstitutional infringement of their freedom of speech. Assuming that their action constituted a form of speech within the meaning of the First Amendment, the right is subject to such reasonable regulation as is provided by this ordinance. The city may proscribe conduct which incites to violence or works an injury on property, and that such prohibition has an impact on speech or expression, otherwise permissible, does not necessarily invalidate the legislation.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), affirming an order granting defendant's motion to dismiss the underlying complaint, in a negligence action arising from an automobile accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In appellant's underlying negligence action for injuries arising from an automobile accident which occurred in Ontario, defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the law of the place where the accident occurred governed, and asserted that Ontario's guest statute barred recovery. Appellant sought review of the judgment affirming the order granting defendant's motion to dismiss. The reviewing court reversed its prior choice of law rule for torts, which was based on the law of the place of the tort, and held that the applicable choice of law rule should also reflect a consideration of other factors relevant to the purposes served by the enforcement or denial of the remedy. Comparison of the relative &quot;contacts&quot; and &quot;interests&quot; of New York and Ontario in the action made it clear that the concern of New York was unquestionably greater and more direct, and the interest of Ontario was at best minimal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment appealed from was reversed, and the motion to dismiss was denied, as the court discarded its prior steadfast application of the choice of law rule based on the place of the tort.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Conflict of laws -- law governing tort actions -- traditional choice of law rule that law of place of tort invariably governs is discarded and &quot;center of gravity&quot; or &quot;grouping of contacts&quot; doctrine applied to permit action by passenger against owner and driver of automobile to recover for injuries sustained in accident in Ontario, Canada, despite Ontario guest statute barring such recovery, inasmuch as automobile was garaged, licensed and insured in New York, all parties were New York residents, and Ontario's only relation to occurrence was that accident occurred there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff and defendant, residents of Rochester, left that city in defendant's automobile, plaintiff as guest, for a week-end trip to Canada.  While driving in the Province of Ontario, there was an accident allegedly owing to the negligence of the defendant who was driving. Plaintiff may bring an action in this State for damages for injuries sustained despite Ontario's statute providing that owner or driver of a motor vehicle is not liable for damages resulting from injury to the guest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The inflexible rule that substantive rights and liabilities are invariably determinable by the law of the place of the tort should be discarded and the &quot;center of gravity&quot; or &quot;grouping of contacts&quot; doctrine adopted.  Justice, fairness and best practical results may best be achieved by giving controlling effect to the law of the jurisdiction which, because of its relation or contact with the occurrence or the parties, has the greatest concern with the specific issue raised in the litigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The action involves injuries sustained by a New York guest as the result of the negligence of a New York host in the operation of an automobile, garaged, licensed and insured in New York, in the course of a journey which began and was to end in New York.  The sole relationship of Ontario is that the accident occurred there.  The issue involved is not whether defendant offended against a rule of the road prescribed by Ontario for motorists generally or violated a standard of conduct imposed by that jurisdiction, which then would usually have a predominant, if not exclusive, concern, but rather whether the guest, solely because of his status as guest, is barred from recovering damages for a conceded wrong.  The determination of that issue, as well as other issues, depends on the law of the jurisdiction, in this instance New York, which has the strongest interest therein.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - New York City sales and use taxes - summary judgment dismissing complaint was properly granted in action to declare unconstitutional article 42 of Regulations of City Comptroller of City of New York insofar as it provided that sales tax, imposed by city on personalty, automobile in present action, purchased by its residents within its corporate limits, was to be computed upon net receipts of sale after deduction of trade-in allowance made by vendor, whereas compensating use tax, imposed by city on personalty purchased by its residents outside of its corporate limits, was to be computed upon total selling price, without deduction of trade-in allowance - there was sufficient basis for classification in different tax treatment of trade-in automobiles in transactions taking place outside of City of New York by reason of greater cost of enforcing compensating use tax and greater likelihood of resale of used automobile within City of New York - no other question passed upon.  </SPAN></P>
