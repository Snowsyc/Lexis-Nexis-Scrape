</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the decedent's estate representative and mother, appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon), in favor of defendants, Children's Services Division and youth caregiver, for the alleged wrongful death of her son. Plaintiff argued that the trial court erred in allowing the jury to consider the comparative fault of the decedent's parents in contributing to decedent's death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on her contention that the person seeking recovery was decedent's personal representative and not a beneficiary entitled to recover for wrongful death, the mother reasoned that the alleged fault of her and her husband in contributing to her son's death could not be compared with defendants' fault under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18.470. She argued that the affirmative defenses that sought to make that comparison should be stricken for failure to state a defense. Defendants contended that the mother's pretrial motion to strike the defenses was insufficient to preserve the issue. The court found that although the mother could have raised the issue at trial she was not required to do so to preserve the issue and found that the conduct of beneficiaries would be considered in determining whether contributory negligence barred a wrongful death claim. Consequently, the jury could properly consider the alleged fault of the mother and her husband because they were beneficiaries who were entitled to recover damages. It followed, then, that the trial court properly denied the mother's motion to strike the affirmative defenses that raised the fault of the mother and her husband as a defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the trial court finding that the affirmative defense of the mother and her husband's comparative fault was not barred was affirmed in the mother's suit, brought as the personal estate representative, for the wrongful death of her son while in defendants' custody.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of no contest and was convicted of menacing, in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.190, a class A misdemeanor. He was placed on probation for two years. In seeking reversal of his conviction from the District Court, Clackamas County (Oregon), defendant argued that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter any judgment and, thus, any sentence imposed was in excess of that allowed by law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised the jurisdictional defect for the first time on appeal. The court upheld the judgment and sentence of the district court. Because defendant pleaded no contest, under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.050(1), his right to direct appeal was statutorily limited to challenging the district court's disposition as exceeding the maximum allowable by law or as unconstitutionally cruel and unusual. Based on defendant's argument, the court's inquiry was limited to whether his sentence exceeded the maximum allowable. Defendant was correct that the district court lacked jurisdiction because his crime was committed after a statutory amendment removed class A misdemeanors from the jurisdictional authority of district courts. However, the court found that his sentence did not exceed the maximum allowable by law. A two-year probationary sentence was within the statutory limits and within the sentencing limits of the district court under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.010(4). Although defendant purported to challenge an &quot;excessive sentence,&quot; the essence of his argument was that the conviction itself was improper. Review of that issue was not available under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.050(1).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Umatilla County (Oregon), which denied his petition for postconviction relief, after he was convicted of manslaughter in the second degree, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.125, assault in the fourth degree, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.175, and felon in possession of a firearm, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.270.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of, inter alia, manslaughter in the second degree after a gun he struck a third party with discharged and fatally shot the victim. He sought postconviction relief, alleging inadequate assistance of counsel and challenging the lawfulness of his sentence. On appeal from the denial of his request for relief, defendant argued that his alleged drug dealing, his prior convictions and his assaultive behavior toward others were irrelevant to whether he was reckless in later striking the third party with a handgun. His counsel's failure to object to the evidence, he argued, was therefore deficient and prejudicial. The unchallenged use of irrelevant evidence to prove recklessness was likely to have influenced the jury to decide the manslaughter charge on an improper basis. Defense counsel's failure to object was therefore not a judgment call, but rather a failure to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment. The error had a tendency to affect the result of the prosecution on the manslaughter charge. Defendant was therefore denied adequate assistance of counsel under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, and was entitled to relief from his manslaughter conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed and remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to grant defendant postconviction relief on his manslaughter conviction. Defense counsel's failure to object to the prosecutor's improper remarks prejudiced defendant and had a tendency to affect the result of the prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction, upon a guilty plea, by the Circuit Court, Coos County (Oregon) for delivery of a controlled substance. After sentencing, defendant submitted an affidavit of indigence, but the trial court denied his motions for appointment of counsel for an appeal and a transcript of the trial court proceedings at state expense. The issue on appeal was whether he was entitled under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.500(3) to the transcript.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court denied his motions, defendant moved the court, apparently pursuant to Or. R. App. P. 3.05(5), for court-appointed counsel and a transcript at state expense. The court appointed counsel under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.500(1) but denied the motion for a transcript with leave to renew upon showing that a transcript was necessary. The due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment did not mandate an unconditional entitlement to a free transcript. The court denied the motion because defendant had not made a sufficient showing under &sect; 138.500(3) that the transcript was material and necessary. Section 138.500(3) required counsel to make a showing of some possible contention for appeal that required a transcript to assess. Because defendant pled guilty and was given a presumptive sentence pursuant to the sentencing guidelines, the cognizable issues on appeal were very limited and, correspondingly, appellate counsel's window of opportunity to identify a contention for appeal was small. Since appellate counsel could not suggest a reasonably cognizable contention to raise on appeal, there was no necessity for a transcript at state expense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for a trial transcript at state expense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board deferred the inmate's parole release date by two years because he suffered from a mental or emotional disturbance which rendered him a danger to the health and safety of the community.

The court held that (1) judicial review, as defined by ORS &sect; 144.335, described direct review of an order in a contested case; (2) ORS &sect; 144.335(2), which was enacted after he committed his crime, did not violate the ex post facto protections of the state and federal Constitutions because the law did not enhance the inmate's punishment; (3) both before and after the amendment to ORS &sect; 144.335, the standard for deferral of an inmate's release date was whether the inmate had a mental or emotional disturbance and the only change to the law had been procedural, i.e. whether inmates could directly appeal deferral determinations to the appellate court; and (4) ORS &sect; 144.335(2) was constitutional and barred review of the inmate's petition.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 181.585, former &sect; 181.507.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parolee was convicted of sodomy and sexual abuse for molesting his five- and seven-year-old half brothers. His sentence was suspended and he was placed on five years' probation. Five months later, he was convicted of first-degree sexual abuse for molesting an eight-year-old neighbor boy, and his probation was revoked. He was sentenced to concurrent terms of a maximum of 10 years on the prior sodomy convictions, five years on the prior sexual abuse convictions, and five years on the last conviction. Nearly six years later, after an exit interview and upon reconsideration, the Board affirmed the parolee's release date and imposed a minimum of 12 months' supervision. An accompanying order included a specific finding that the parolee was a &quot;predatory sex offender&quot; under former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 181.507. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that the Board did not abuse its discretion to determine whether the parolee was such an offender where a corrections department assessment gave him a &quot;high&quot; risk level and that his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights were not violated because the labeling of him as a predatory sex offender did not constitute punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought judicial review of an order of the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision (Oregon), which imposed a 12-month term of supervised parole, followed by unsupervised parole for the balance of his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">According to petitioner, at the time his crime was committed, he was subject to former ORS 144.310 applied, which provided for discharge from his sentence after six months or a year of parole. The court agree with the Board that petitioner's argument proceeded from a false premise, namely, that he was subject to ORS 144.310 at the time his crime was committed. At the time of the crime, a different statute, former ORS 144.305 (repealed by Or. Laws 1993, ch. 680, &sect; 7), applied, and that statute provided for parole extending for the entire term of an offender's sentence. ORS 144.305 applied to all crimes committed after December 4, 1986. Petitioner's was such a crime. ORS 144.310 remained &quot;on the books&quot; only as to crimes committed before the effective date of ORS 144.305. The amendment to ORS 144.310 in 1987 was to replace the term &quot;Corrections Division&quot; with the term &quot;Department of Corrections.&quot; Or. Laws 1987, ch. 320, &sect; 61. There was no repeal, express or implied, of ORS 144.305 and the Board properly applied it. The Board's order did not violate the ex post facto clause of either the state or federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employee challenged a decision of the Circuit Court, Coos County (Oregon), which granted summary judgment dismissing her personal injury claim against defendant former employer. The trial court held that the employee's exclusive remedy was under the Workers' Compensation Act. The employee argued that the Act violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 because it took away her common law remedy against the employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer accepted the employee's workers' compensation claim. The employee sent the employer's insurer medical bills for treatment that occurred after she was declared medically stationary. The parties entered into a disputed claim settlement. The employee then filed the instant action. She argued that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 656.018(2) violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 because, at common law, she was only required to prove that the employer's negligence was a substantial factor in causing her injury; under &sect; 656.018(2), she was required to prove the employment was the major contributing cause of her condition. However, the employee did not provide the court with an actual factual setting that properly framed the issue of the statute's constitutionality. Under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, the legislature had the authority to limit common law remedies as long as it did not leave the injured party entirely without a remedy. The employer accepted compensability of the original injury and paid the employee to settle her later claims. Thus, the employee was not denied a remedy because she was unable to prove that her work-related injuries were the major contributing cause of her condition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the employer.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court determined that it could consider petitioner's assignments of error, which challenged putative errors in the city proceedings rather than errors by the Board because the Board's decision took the form of a memorandum decision. Furthermore, the Board had similar authority to that possessed by appellate courts to summarily dispose of cases before them, which included, under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 197.835(16) the authority to decide cases without opinion. Although the Board did not have blanket authority to decide cases without explanation, petitioner provided no specific basis for reversal or remand to the Board. Finally, the court determined that neither Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 197.835(16) nor the Board's interpretation of it violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 or U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of endangering the welfare of minors and furnishing obscene materials to minors. He appealed the count of furnishing obscene materials to minors on the ground that &sect; 167.065(1)(a) was an unconstitutional restriction on free expression under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 and under U.S. Const. amend. I, and the court reversed. The court found that it could sever a portion of the statute previously found to be unconstitutional and could independently consider the remaining provisions. It determined that the prohibitions against furnishing materials to minors depicting sexual conduct or excitement violated the Oregon Constitution because the statute was an impermissible content-based statute directed solely at prohibiting certain communication with minors. The statute failed to identify either expressly or by inference an actual effect or harm that it was designed to prevent. The court also concluded that the statute did not represent a modern version of a historically established exception to the Oregon Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate petitioned for a for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that he suffered from severe headaches, jaw aches and migraines stemming from Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction (TMJ), and that he had a severe overbite that caused his teeth to grind and chip off. The inmate alleged that the dismissal of the writ of habeas corpus by the trial court was erroneous on the grounds that his affidavit raised genuine issues of material fact as to the propriety of habeas corpus relief. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the inmate's affidavit recited that two different dentists at two different correctional facilities told him that until his severe overbite was &quot;repaired&quot; his teeth would continue to chip and break off. Thus, the inmate's affidavit raised a genuine issue as to whether he had been afforded such care for his overbite as was &quot;reasonably available&quot; under the circumstances.

The court found that the question of defendant's pre-SPO issuance contacts were without legitimate purpose, within the meaning of Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court, Yamhill County (Oregon), which suppressed evidence seized from two defendants charged with multiple counts of manufacture, delivery and possession of a controlled substance, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 475.992, and with two counts of child neglect, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.547. Defendants also claimed that a search warrant for their property was based upon a false affidavit of two informants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A warrant was issued for a search based upon the affidavit of a state police officer, who stated that he had information from two citizen informants describing a large marijuana growing operation conducted by defendants. The property was searched by the police and members of the Oregon National Guard, and over 100 plants and paraphernalia were hauled away. The trial court found that the affidavit did not specify that the two informants saw the property at the same time and did not corroborate each other and that there was not probable cause to issue a warrant. On review, the court found that a lesser degree of proof was needed to establish the veracity of citizens without a connection to the crime being investigated, that cross-corroboration was not needed, and that the information in the affidavit met the lesser showing of reliability. The court reversed the suppression and found that the execution of the warrant was not unconstitutional because the Guard participated in it as part of an order to cooperate with a county interagency narcotics team.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the trial court, which had suppressed the evidence seized in a search of defendants' property, and remanded. The court affirmed the trial court's decision on defendants' cross-appeal and ruled that the affidavit in support of the warrant was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was a mentally retarded and hearing-impaired 25-year old woman. At trial, defendant had sought to introduce evidence of statements that defendant had heard regarding the victim's sexual reputation. The trial court rejected the introduction of such statements, but it did allow evidence of specific instances of the victim's past sexual relationships with two other men and evidence that she frequented the tavern where she had met defendant and acted suggestively towards men there. On review, the court held that under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.325(3), defendant's generalized belief that the victim could consent to sexual relations was immaterial to his asserted state of mind; rather, to avoid culpability, defendant had to have shown that he did not know of the facts or conditions responsible for the victim's incapacity to consent. The court agreed with the State that the victim's alleged reputation for promiscuous sexual activity was immaterial to that inquiry. Rather, what was critical was defendant's awareness of the victim's mental retardation. The court rejected defendant's remaining assignments of error and affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court erred in allowing defendant's demurrer because &sect; 166.663 imposed a reasonable restriction that was directly aimed at the public's safety and welfare. It did not unreasonably infringe on defendant's right to bear arms. Section 166.663 regulated only the manner of possession, therefore, it was permissible legislation because it was directed to a specific public safety or welfare concern and did not unreasonably encroach on the constitutional right. Section 166.663 did not proscribe mere possession of a firearm. Only when an individual was casting artificial light from a motor vehicle was the manner of possession restricted. Defendant's facial vagueness challenge was not properly before the court, because &sect; 166.663 did not implicate rights under the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendant's motion to compel, granted the station's motion to quash, and convicted defendant of trespass. The court affirmed.

Defendant was not deprived his right to compulsory process under Ore. Const. art.

The court found no merit to the landowners' claim that loss of future earnings would fail the standard of proof under common law.

The dog sniffed the outside of the vehicle and &quot;alerted&quot; at the passenger door. A search warrant was obtained and drugs were found in the vehicle. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress. On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendant had a privacy interest in the vehicle's contents because they did not &quot;announce&quot; their presence by an odor that the officer could smell while outside of the vehicle. Therefore, the use of the dog constituted a search. None of the officer's observations, including the facts that the vehicle contained several air fresheners, three occupants were well-dressed, and it was traveling to Tacoma, justified a reasonable suspicion that the vehicle contained drugs.

One issue was whether the land use board had jurisdiction. The court found that the regulations had a significant nexus with land use and that the land use board had jurisdiction. However, although the county could regulate the subject, its regulations could not be inconsistent with the statutes. The court held that a portion referring only to application processing fees was not invalid for that reason alone and that Or. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged pretrial orders from the Circuit Court, Columbia County (Oregon), which, in different cases, granted defendants' demurrers to identically worded two-count indictments. Each defendant had been charged with the offenses of unlawful delivery of a controlled substance (marijuana) and unlawful possession of a controlled substance (marijuana) in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 475.992(1), (4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants demurred to their indictments on the grounds that count one included two or more crimes not separately pleaded and that count two failed to include an adequate allegation concerning the amount of marijuana allegedly possessed. The trial court granted the demurrers. On appeal, the State alleged that count one did not charge defendants with multiple offenses, but that it alleged one offense and two alternative offense-subcategory facts that did not need to be alleged in separate counts. In reversing the circuit court's orders, the court ruled that when an indictment properly alleged the elements of an underlying offense, the inclusion of alternative grounds for enhancing the sentence did not create additional offenses. The trial court erred in concluding that count one alleged multiple offenses. The court also ruled that where the language of a statute plainly drew a distinction between the elements of a crime and an exception or proviso, the State did not have to allege that the exception did not apply. Accordingly, the State was not required to allege that the felony-offense exception did not apply.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Multnomah County (Oregon) sustaining defendants' demurrers to charges of riot. The trial court concluded that the statute underlying the charges, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.015, was unconstitutionally overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with violating the anti-rioting statute,&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.015. They demurred, asserting, inter alia, that &sect; 166.015 was unconstitutional in that it was directed to the content of expression and did not fall within any historically recognized exception to the free speech protections of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8; the statute was overbroad in that it criminalized expression protected under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8; and the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court rejected defendants' arguments that the &sect; 166.015 was content-driven and unconstitutionally vague, but ultimately allowed their demurrers on the ground that the statute was overbroad. The State argued that &sect; 166.015 was not susceptible to facial overbreadth challenges, by way of demurrer, based on Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court determined that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.015 did not expressly refer to speech. Nor was expression the only means by which the statute could be violated. Consequently, the court concluded that &sect; 166.015 was not susceptible to an overbreadth challenge. The court also held that the phrase &quot;grave risk of public alarm&quot; in &sect; 166.015 was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the exception and motion and entered judgment. The insurer was correct that, to the extent that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 754.504(10) was mandatory and made an arbitration award binding against a nondemanding party, it was unconstitutional. However, if the parties agreed to arbitrate, the insurer had not been deprived of its right to a jury trial. Whether the parties agreed to arbitration was a question of fact and the court, on appeal, was bound by the trial court's findings with evidentiary support.

They contended that the denial of the use of the records violated their free speech rights to communicate with clients. The appellate court reversed, holding that the two statutes were invalid. Collectively, the two statutes held that accident records were not privileged except that they could not be used for &quot;commercial purposes.&quot; The use of the records for such purposes was a crime. The court found that, first, while the State could restrict the use of private information, the records were public information. Next, the court found that the statutes violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 as content-based restrictions on speech. While content-based restrictions were not per se unconstitutional, the State failed to show that the restriction fell within an historical exception. There was no historical exception for the use of public records for commercial purposes. The State's argument that the statutes protected the privacy rights of victims was rejected because the statutes permitted the media to have access to the records and allowed access to anyone as long as the records were not used for commercial purposes.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had entered a guilty plea, so the only issue on appeal, pursuant ORS 138.050(3)(a), was whether the sentence exceeded the maximum allowable by law. The sentence did not exceed that allowed under the properly amended citation for a Class A misdemeanor, so the sentence was affirmed. Defendant had waived his argument that the sentence exceeded the maximum allowed for an infraction because he had not objected to the amended citation or withdrawn his plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two separate cases consolidated on appeal, the State appealed the dismissal of accusatory instruments charging defendants with violations of stalking protective orders in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 163.747 and 163.750 by the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Oregon) and the Circuit Court of Washington County (Oregon).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were accused of violating stalking protective orders. One defendant was charged under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.747 for violating a protective order issued under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.735. The other defendant was charged under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.750 for violating a protective order issued under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.738. The trial courts dismissed the charges after finding that the statutory definition of the phrase &quot;without legitimate purpose,&quot; as a component of the crime of violating a stalking protective order, was unconstitutionally vague. Affirming the trial court's rulings, the court held that the term &quot;legitimate purpose,&quot; as used in the stalking statutes,&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 163.730(7), 163.732, 163.735, and 163.738, and as in pari materia with Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 163.747 and 163.750, was unconstitutionally vague. The statutes on their face did not tell a person of ordinary intelligence what was encompassed within the term &quot;legitimate purpose.&quot; Because they failed to do so, the statutes gave no warning as to what conduct had to be avoided. They provided no guidance to the trier of fact and permitted ad hoc judgments as to what was legitimate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was a passenger in a small airplane that crashed shortly after taking off from an airstrip, which was located at a restaurant and resort facility. The decedent's estate initiated a wrongful death action against the division. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the division, holding that the division had not acted negligently and that, in any event, the division was immune from liability. On review, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case. In reaching its decision, the court held that a genuine issue of material fact existed regarding whether the division's classification of the airstrip as a personal use airstrip, under Or. Admin. R. 738-20-015(2)(a), was proper. Furthermore, the court disagreed with the trial court's holding that the division's decision to approve and register the airstrip as a personal use airport qualified for discretionary function immunity under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.265(3)(c). Thus, the court ruled that the trial court's entry of summary judgment was in error.</SPAN></P>

To protect the purchaser's policies DIF issued a news release that stated that it would consider any attempt to &quot;roll-over&quot; the policies bought by the purchaser to be a violation of the receivership order. The marketing agency was directed to refrain from marketing attempts aimed at the customer list for eight months. The marketing agency brought an action against DIF and the purchaser for inverse condemnation and argued that the purchaser had tortiously interfered with its business relations by asking DIF to restrain its marketing abilities. The trial court granted defendants' motions for directed verdict. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the director's actions were not sufficient to effect a taking. The director's actions raised no legal impediment to the marketing agency's use of its customer list.

The owner claimed that with regard to two lots the county had not followed the proper procedures, and he was not given the opportunity to repurchase the lots. The board of commissioners denied his appeal, and he filed suit for a declaratory judgment. The circuit court permitted him to amend his action to include a petition for review of the commissioners' decision. The matter was dismissed on the merits. On appeal, the court held that the circuit court never had jurisdiction over the issue. The only mechanism available to the owner was a petition for review in conformance with Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 34.030, not a declaratory judgment action. The petition for review was not timely because it was not filed within 60 days of the commissioners' decision.

The constitution did not require equal school funding, only that the education system was uniform in the prescribed courses of study and educational progression. Equality of resources from district to district was not required. The court also ruled that even if the funding system discriminated against a true class under Or. Const. art.

The court rejected the challenge, finding that defendant did not just fail to make a particular argument as to the admissibility of the evidence.

The institution's response included both a memorandum of law and an affidavit by a nurse at the institution.

On appeal, the court held that the trial court's consideration of factual materials in the context of the show cause order was erroneous and could not be reconciled with the statutory framework requiring the show cause order. The statutory scheme contemplated that factual issues would be litigated after the writ issued and the return and replication were made. Further, the court found that the inmate stated a sufficient claim in his petition in that he alleged that the lack of arch supported left him unable to walk, that arch supports were available through the commissary, and that notwithstanding his indigency, the institution refused to supply the supports.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a sentence of life without the possibility of parole that was imposed by the Circuit Court, Douglas County (Oregon) following her plea of guilty to a charge of aggravated murder, a violation of ORS 163.095. Defendant, who stipulated to the sentence while reserving her right to appeal it, claimed that the sentence violated Article I, &sect; 40, of the Oregon Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to plea negotiations, defendant pleaded guilty to aggravated murder. Under a plea agreement, defendant stipulated to a sentence of life without the possibility of parole as described in ORS 163.105(1)(b), reserving the right to appeal the constitutional issue of whether the sentence was legal under Article I, &sect; 40, of the Oregon Constitution. The trial court accepted the plea agreement and defendant sought review of the sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the sentence was not subject to review. The court reasoned that review was precluded under ORS 138.122(2)(d) because the sentence was a stipulated sentence within the meaning of ORS 135.407. The court held that defendant's purported reservation of the right to review of the sentence did not confer upon the court the authority to review it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his conviction should be reversed because his statements to police officers were not voluntary. The court agreed and held that a confession or admission was deemed to be involuntary unless the State affirmatively showed that it was voluntarily made. The State had to prove voluntariness by a preponderance of the evidence. The court held that the State failed to meet its burden. The court further held that the error in admitting defendant's statement was not harmless. The court held that the admittance of defendant's statement was not harmless because there was not substantial and convincing evidence of guilt and little likelihood that the error affected the verdict. The court held that although there was substantial and convincing evidence that defendant had assaulted his son on various occasions before June 19, 1991, defendant's statements to the police that he had shaken his son on that date provided the final link to his death.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed because &sect; 163.680 regulated speech within the meaning of Or. Const. art.

In addition, the state failed to show that &sect; 163.680 fell within any historical free speech exception, such as perjury, solicitation, or verbal assistance in crime, some forms of theft, forgery, and fraud. Furthermore, there was no basis for a territorial foundation for an historical exception and the posited historical exception was to undefined to include &sect; 163.680.

The opposing parties included the Director of the Department, the Superintendent of the state penitentiary, and the superintendent of a women's correctional center.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate submitted a visiting application for his wife, who at the time was incarcerated at the women's correctional center. His wife had previously been convicted for violating ORS 162.185 (supplying contraband) and ORS 475.992 (possession of controlled substance). The inmate's request was denied under OAR 291-127-020, which prohibited visitation by individuals convicted of certain drug related crimes. The inmate sought administrative review of that decision, and the prison superintendent affirmed the visitation denial. The inmate then filed the instant petition for declaratory judgment under ORS 28.010 et seq., alleging that the Department's visitation rules were unconstitutional. The trial court entered a judgment in favor of the Department. On appeal, the court held that because the inmate was directly challenging the visitation rules of the Department, Oregon Administrative Procedures Act review was exclusive and the inmate was precluded from obtaining declaratory relief. Accordingly, it stated, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider the request by the inmate for declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>

The court stated the juvenile court did not have exclusive jurisdiction over this type of case. The prospective adoptive parents alleged CSD's final order denying their request to adopt the child was based on their religious lifestyle and therefore violated the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the United States Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Or. Admin. R. 860-35-020(8), Or. Admin. R. 860-35-070(5), and Or. Admin. R. 860-35-110 required the local telephone company to offer collocation to ESPs, such as respondent telecommunications corporation. The PUC's rules required that the local telephone company allow each ESP to occupy a portion of the local telephone company's property for ESP equipment. The local telephone company facially changed the rules, claiming that they effected a taking under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 18 and under U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV. The court held that the rules were valid because collocation did not constitute a permanent physical occupation when the local telephone company had some control over the duration of the occupation, pursuant to Or. Admin. R. 860-35-110(4)(f). Further, Or. Admin. R. 860-35-110(4)(a) vested the local telephone company with some control over the extent of the occupation when there was no existing space for collocation. Moreover, the rules did not offend the traditional rights to possess property and to exclude others from the use of it. Therefore, it followed that the rules, on their face, did not violate Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 18 or U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 1873.400, petitioners, timber and logging organizations, sought review of certain rules issued by respondent Oregon Occupational Safety and Heath Division of the Department of Insurance and Finance. Petitioners alleged that the statements of need and of fiscal impact in the rules were inadequate to satisfy Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 183.335(2)(b)(B), (D) and that the rules exceeded their statutory authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Division promulgated new rules to implement their authority under Or. Rev. Stat. ch. 654 to regulated health and safety in employment in the state. Petitioners challenged the new rules on numerous grounds, including that the Division exceeded its constitutional authority and its statutory authority. The court reviewed the new rules in detail and held that they were valid. The court held that the notice of proposed action was sufficient to alert interested persons that the rules might have some effect on them. The court also held that the agency's fiscal impact statement was adequate because the notice stated that it was uncertain of what impact the rules would have but stated historical trends and averages and thus, satisfied the requirement to use only available information to create that statement. The court ruled that the rules did not exceed the Division's statutory authority and were not unconstitutional vague. The court noted that the authority granted to an agency was quite board, and though an agency was not permitted to supplement an enabling statute by altering it through rules or created inconsistent rules, the rules at issue did not go beyond the enabling statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court, Polk County (Oregon), which following a jury trial convicted him of three counts of murder by abuse, Or.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted kicking his toddler daughter the night before she died. The court remanded for merger of the convictions for murder by abuse because there was only one victim and one statute violated and for resentencing.

The court found that the state constitution required Miranda-like warnings when a defendant was in &quot;full custody&quot; or the setting was &quot;compelling&quot; and that the federal Constitution required warnings when his freedom was significantly restrained. The court determined that defendant was entitled to warnings when he was escorted to the police station after he had confessed to kicking his daughter because the officers should have recognized the circumstances as &quot;compelling,&quot; that he was adequately warned and knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights, and that continued questioning after he asked for counsel was constitutionally permissible because the request was limited.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed on appeal that the DNA testing deprived him of his due process rights because the storage of his DNA profile would label him a sex offender and that the label would impair his ability to benefit from treatment. Defendant also claimed that the drawing of blood would create an unreasonable risk to his physical and mental health because it would expose him to physical risks of bleeding and soreness. The court rejected defendant's claims. The court ruled that defendant was considered to be a sex offender without the DNA testing and storage of the DNA profile because defendant committed acts that would have constituted sodomy. The court found that there was no evidence that the blood draw would threaten defendant's physical or mental health.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizens sought to enjoin a proposed ballot initiative to amend the Oregon Constitution to prohibit governments from preventing discrimination against homosexuals. The court reversed summary judgment for plaintiffs on their claim that the initiative violated Ore. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1(2)(d), holding that the initiative concerned only a single subject. The court also reversed summary judgment on plaintiffs' claim that the initiative violated Ore. Const. art.

While the trial court incorrectly concluded that plaintiffs lacked standing to assert their remaining claims, the court nevertheless affirmed dismissal of their due process and equal protection claims because they were attacks on the constitutionality of the measure if enacted, and therefore were improper pre-enactment challenges to the proposed measure. The court affirmed dismissal of the claim that U.S. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a commercial shrimper. State police officers saw shrimp being unloaded from his fishing vessel to a seafood plant. Unofficial shrimp samples taken by the plant's employees revealed counts that ranged from 180 to 190 shrimp per pound. Defendant was charged with violating OAR 635-05-200. At trial, the officers testified that each of the shrimp they sampled had a full body but legs, antennae, or other appendages were missing. Defendant filed a motion for a judgment of acquittal, claiming that there was insufficient evidence that the samples tested were whole unbroken shrimp. The trial court denied the motion. A jury convicted defendant. The court held that the plain, natural, and ordinary meaning of the terms &quot;whole shrimp&quot; and &quot;whole unbroken shrimp&quot; in OAR 635-05-200 was shrimp that possessed whole bodies. The evidence introduced was sufficient for the jury to conclude that defendant landed shrimp exceeding an average count of 160 whole shrimp per pound. The language of OAR 635-05-200 was sufficiently definite for persons of common intelligence to understand that the prohibited conduct was landing shrimp whose bodies were too small.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The eldest child testified at trial, and the statements of the two younger children were admitted under the hearsay exception in Or. Evid. Code 803(18a)(b). The court held that the trial court's interpretation of 803(18a)(b), which gave defendant no opportunity to confront the younger children to determine if they were, in fact, competent to testify or that they were not credible, violated defendant's constitutional right of confrontation. According, the court reversal the convictions involving these victims. The convictions relating to the eldest child were not inextricably intertwined with the other children's statements. It was not error to deny defendant's motion to compel election as the jury instruction sufficiently ensured that the jury convicted only upon a determination that the same act had occurred on one occasion. There was no abuse of discretion in denying defendant's motion to sever the offenses as the evidence was not so confusing that the jury was unable to consider the offenses separately. Violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 418.747(3), (4) was not a ground for dismissing an indictment, suppressing evidence, or granting a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The criminal proceedings were terminated without a conviction, so the activist filed a false arrest and malicious prosecution suit against the retailer. The trial court granted the retailer's motion for summary judgment, but on appeal, the court held that there were fact issues that precluded summary judgment for the retailer. The court further held that the retailer's reliance on favorable but ultimately reversed court decisions was no defense to the false arrest claim because the appellate level decisions on the issue established that the activist had not unlawfully been on the premises. The court also held that the retailer' reliance on the ultimately reversed cases did not provide a defense against the malicious prosecution suit because the evidence showed that the prosecution may have been motivated by malice against the activist. Finally, the court held the activist was not precluded from recovering punitive damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case on remand from the Oregon Supreme Court, defendant appealed her conviction for conduct that interfered with a police officer's lawful performance of a duty, a violation of Eugene, Or., Municipal Code &sect; 4.907. The trial court overruled defendant's demurrer that alleged that &sect; 4.907 was unconstitutional on its face under Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 2, which prohibited localities from enacting laws that conflicted with state criminal laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand, the court considered whether &sect; 4.907 was in conflict with Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 162.235 and &sect; 162.315, which dealt with interference with the administration of any governmental or judicial function and resistance to arrest. The court applied a three-part test: it examined the ordinance and statutes, it determined what conduct the ordinance prohibited, and it looked to see whether the applicable statutes permitted that conduct, either expressly, by its legislative history, or otherwise. The court found that &sect; 162.235 applied to conduct other than resisting arrest and required that the prohibited conduct be manifested by threats, violence, or physical interference, a limitation that recognized certain constitutional safeguards such as freedom of speech and assembly. The court further found that &sect; 162.315 expressly excluded passive resistance from the crime of resisting arrest. The court held that these statutes allowed a passive refusal to leave a particular area in response to a lawful order from a police officer, an act that Eugene, Or., Municipal Code &sect; 4.907 prohibited. The court held the ordinance therefore violated Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the ODA's decision and held that &sect; 634.372(2) did not violate the state constitutional prohibition against delegating legislative authority to private entities because the manufacturers' labels were subject to specific requirements imposed by a comprehensive federal regulatory scheme. The ODA's definition of the word &quot;expose&quot; was consistent with a commentary drafted by the Environmental Protection Agency, which recognized that the word was subject to broad interpretation. The ODA's construction of the statute was also consistent with the legislature's intent of regulating the use of pesticides in the public interest, and it preserved the statutory distinctions between intentional and negligent misapplications.

The court ruled that the trial court's denial of defendant's demurrer to the indictment for murder by abuse was not error. The court determined that Or. Rev.

The court concluded that defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal on the charge of criminal nonsupport was properly denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former employer argued that the trial court erred in denying its motions to withdraw from the jury the issue of its vicarious liability for conduct of a sheriff that issued the criminal citation for theft in the second degree against the former employee and that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18.560 capped the total award of noneconomic damages for all of the former employee's tort claims arising out of the same operative facts at $ 500,000. Defendants contended that the trial court erred in denying their motions for directed verdict on plaintiff's claims for intentional infliction of severe emotional distress and challenged the jury's punitive damages award as excessive. The court concluded that the trial court's judgment was proper. The court found that (1) the former employer's right to control over the sheriff's conduct constituted a master-servant relationship, (2) the complaint stated a claim for intentional infliction of severe emotional distress, (3) the statutory damage cap violated Or. Const. art. VII (amended), &sect; 3, and (4) the punitive damages award did not violate defendants' rights.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled further that the search of defendant's home was not illegal although the executing officer had not read the warrant to him as required by Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly engaged in certain acts of sexual misconduct in 1986. Prior to its amendment in 1991, &sect; 131.125(2) provided that the statute of limitations for defendant's alleged misconduct was three years. Under &sect; 131.125(2) as it read at the time of his alleged violations, the statute of limitations ran in 1989. In amending &sect; 131.125(2), the Oregon Legislature extended the statute of limitations to six years and gave it retroactive effect. The State attempted to prosecute defendant. Defendant argued that to apply &sect; 131.125(2) retroactively to resurrect a criminal action against him when the statutory period had already run violated his U.S. Const. amend. 14 due process rights, violated fundamental fairness, and was an ex post facto law. Concentrating on the issue of fundamental fairness, the court held that &sect; 131.125(2) was invalid insofar as it purported to revive criminal prosecutions that were previously time-barred. The court ruled that the three-year statute of limitations applied to defendant and the State was barred from commencing an action against defendant.</SPAN></P>

The officers seized the property, including the house itself. The city then filed a complaint in rem against the property. Claimant answered, generally denying the allegations of the complaint and asserting an affirmative defense of personal use. Claimant did not allege the unconstitutionality of the forfeiture statute. The trial court held that the seizure and forfeiture were constitutional. On appeal, the court declined to review claimant's constitutional challenge because it was not preserved. Inter alia, the claimant never raised the issue below and the alleged error was not &quot;apparent&quot; for purposes of Or. R. App. P. 5.45(2).

The statute governed the dispensing of gasoline.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agricultural cooperatives provided cardlock gasoline dispensing services to their members and persons who purchased gasoline through cardlock facilities. The gasoline dispensing laws required that customers purchase a minimum of 2,400 gallons of fuel per year and set certain exemptions. The trial court found that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 480.360 violated the Or. Const. art. I, &sect;20 and the Equal Protection Clause. On appeal, the court reversed. It found that the gallonage exemption did not violate the Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, which guaranteed unjustified denial of equal privileges or immunities to individual citizens as well as unjustified differentiation among classes of citizens. The statutory exemption did not make a distinction that fit the definition of a true class. The classification it created was based on characteristics that the law defined and was not one based on characteristics that existed apart from the law. It was not a class cognizable under Or.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners appealed the decision of the Circuit Court, Clackamas County (Oregon), which dismissed the landowners' claims involving nonremonstrance agreements made with defendant city. The dismissal was made because the circuit court found that jurisdiction was with the Land Use Board of Appeals (board). The city appealed the denial of its motion to dismiss the taking claims made by the landowners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the landowners sought a permit from the city to construct a house, the city required that the landowners obtain a lot line adjustment. That adjustment was allowed, but the landowners had to execute nonremonstrance agreements and pledge that they would not oppose future street improvements. The landowners also had to convey a drainage easement. The landowners did so. Then they complained that the nonremonstrance requirement violated the state and federal constitutions, and that the easement was a taking for which they were entitled to monetary compensation. On appeal, the court agreed that the board had jurisdiction over the nonremonstrance agreements because the claims arose out of a land use decision. The court found, however, that the taking claims were not within the board's exclusive jurisdiction. Therefore, the circuit court's denial of the city's motion to dismiss that claim was correct. The court found that the exhaustion and ripeness doctrines were inapplicable to the inverse condemnation claims because there was nothing left to happen at the local or administrative level. What mattered was that there was a reasonable relationship between the condition and the use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed both the landowners' appeal of the dismissal of their claims regarding the nonremonstrance agreements as well as the city's appeal of the denial of its motion to dismiss the taking claims filed by the landowners.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 475.992(1)(a), (4)(b). He challenged the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress statements obtained after he was stopped and evidence was seized from his person and vehicle.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer believed that defendant may have assaulted his wife. While observing defendant, the officer concluded that defendant was under the influence of drugs. The officer stopped defendant and searched his vehicle, which uncovered drugs. Defendant claimed that he was illegally stopped under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 131.615(1) and Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 when placed in the back of a patrol car. On review, the court upheld defendant's conviction. The stop was lawful because the officer had a reasonable suspicion of a crime. The discovery of drug's in defendant's van was not unrelated to the suspected offense and was permissible under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 131.615(3). The court found that the investigatory detention of defendant was as unobtrusive as possible and that a Miranda warning was not required. The court held that defendant was not in custody for purposes of the federal constitution, so his statements need not be excluded from the evidence. There was no basis for suppression of evidence seized from defendant or his van, because the warrantless search was constitutional. Finally, the court concluded that the evidence was sufficient for conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was an Oregon State Police (OSP) officer. As a result of OSP internal investigations, the state filed an information charging defendant with six counts of sexual abuse in the second degree, four counts of official misconduct in the first degree, and four counts of harassment. Defendant successfully moved to dismiss the information, asserting that, because he was compelled to incriminate himself as part of the internal investigation, he was entitled to transactional immunity. On appeal, the court reversed the decision and remanded it to the trial court. The court held that the legislature did not grant defendant transactional immunity as a substitute for his right against self-incrimination and that OSP neither expressly nor impliedly promised that defendant would receive transactional immunity. The court stated that language of the collective bargaining agreement, under which defendant was compelled to cooperate in the investigation, did not promise transactional immunity. Because the state conceded that it violated defendant's right against self-incrimination, the court held that defendant could seek only the usual remedy against unconstitutionally compelled testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, defendant received concurrent life sentences with a 25-year mandatory minimum. Thereafter, the Oregon Supreme Court held that the 25-year minimum, under &sect; 163.115(5), constituted a disproportionate sentence. Defendant appealed, and the court vacated his sentence and remanded. On remand, the trial court sentenced defendant to consecutive life terms and imposed a 10-year minimum sentence. Defendant appealed the minimum sentence. Subsequently, defendant petitioned for post-conviction relief on the ground that his attorney on the second appeal failed to assign error to the imposition of consecutive sentences. The post-conviction court found that the consecutive sentences were unlawful and granted a delayed appeal. The court held that it lacked authority to do anything except affirm. The Oregon Supreme Court remanded the case on the ground that the delayed appeal was proper. The court affirmed. The court stated that it could not conclude that the second sentence was more severe than the original one because it would not speculate about how a parole board might treat defendant's sentences and his actual length of imprisonment or whether he would ever be paroled.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had agreed with the petitioner that his conviction should be set aside because it was obtained in violation of Or. Const. art. VII (amended), &sect; 5(2), because the grand jury that indicted him consisted of only six grand jurors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of criminal nonsupport and did not appeal. He filed a petition for post-conviction relief, alleging that the indictment that resulted in his conviction was obtained in violation of Or. Const. art. VII (amended), &sect; 5(2). The court initially held that petitioner was entitled to raise the issue during post conviction relief even though it was not raised at trial. An issue was ordinarily reviewable on direct appeal only if it was preserved at trial, but an issue that could have been raised at trial was subject to being raised on post-conviction only if it was not preserved at trial.In reversing the judgment of the trial court, the court held that even if the issuance of the indictment by a grand jury of fewer than seven members was a constitutional violation, that violation did not make the conviction void. Post-conviction relief should be granted when a petitioner is denied a substantial constitutional right that rendered the conviction void, or the court lacks jurisdiction to impose the judgment. A conviction based on a defective indictment, even assuming that the defect was one of constitutional dimensions, was at most voidable, but was not void ab initio.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a mentally ill patient, challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court, Clackamas County (Oregon), which involuntarily committed her to a state mental hospital for an additional 180 days. The patient had been involuntarily committed for 180 days pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. 426.130(3) on two previous occasions. The patient attacked the constitutionality of the recommitment procedure under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 426.301-426.307.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient alleged that the entire recommitment procedure of &sect;&sect; 426.301-426.307 was unconstitutional on its face under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and under the Or. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, and art. VII, &sect; 1 (amended). She asserted that for the recommitment scheme to be constitutionally adequate, it had to require that an adversarial hearing be provided to every individual against whom a certification for continued commitment was filed. The court held that the state had a substantial interest in allocating priority to the diagnosis and treatment of patients, rather than to time consuming procedural minuets performed after admittance to justify continuing a patient's confinement. The court also held that requiring a formal hearing for every patient in connection with a certification decision would increase the amount of time that mental health specialists would spend preparing for and participating in hearings and would reduce the amount of time they would spend performing the rehabilitative tasks for which they have been trained.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had granted defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings, pursuant to Or. R. Civ. P. 21B, on the grounds that they were immune from liability under Or. Rev. Stat. 30.265(3)(a) for claims covered by workers' compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father was personal representative of his daughter's estate. She was killed when she was crushed beneath a bus while crossing a street in the course of her employment. On appeal, the court affirmed because the trial court did not err in dismissing the claim. The court rejected the father's contention that &sect; 30.265(3)(a) violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 because the only payment provided under the workers' compensation statute,&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 656.204(1) was a payment for burial expenses. The court held that a legislative alteration of a cause of action was permissible, as long as the injured party was not left entirely without a remedy and the workers' compensation statute provided a remedy that the court could not say was not substantial enough to satisfy the constitution's requirements. The court rejected the father's equal protection challenges to the statute as well and found there was no constitutional violation based on the granting of the privilege to bring a claim only to those persons injured by tortfeasors other than officers, employees or agents of public bodies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the father's wrongful death claim against the municipal corporation and its employee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two counts of burglary. The first count contained an allegation, enhancing the seriousness of the crime, that defendant burglarized an occupied dwelling.

The trial court sentenced defendant to prison and post-prison supervision on the first count, and 180 days of jail incarceration, consecutive to the prison term, and a term of probation on the second count. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the trial court properly refused defendant's requested instruction because it misstated the law: (2) the trial court properly used defendant's juvenile adjudications to calculate his criminal history score; and (3) the trial court improperly imposed a consecutive sentence because the imposition of a jail term consecutive to a prison term violated Or. Admin. R. 253-12-020(d), the trial court could not impose a sentence of 180 days -- the maximum number of custody units, and the probationary term imposed on the second charge should have merged with the post-prison supervision ordered for the first charge.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had entered a &quot;statutory plea&quot; under ORS 135.407.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the sentencing guidelines superseded the provisions of ORS 163.115(3), so that the trial court was without authority under the guidelines to impose a sentence of life imprisonment with a minimum term of 18 years. In affirming, the court noted that the trial court had advised defendant of two specific consequences of the agreement. It explained that by agreement of the parties, the only latitude that the trial court retained in its sentencing decision was whether it would impose a 15-year or 18-year minimum term to accompany the mandatory life sentence, depending on defendant's cooperation with the police. The trial court also advised defendant that if it decided to impose a sentence outside of the 15-to 18-year range, defendant could withdraw his plea and face trial on both charges. The trial court then found that defendant had not cooperated with the police and imposed an 18-year minimum sentence consistent with the agreed range. Finally, under ORS 138.222(2)(d), a court could not review any sentence resulting from an agreement. Consequently, the court was precluded from reviewing defendant's claim.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that a sentence of consecutive one-year terms on the convictions for sexual abuse was error under Oregon Laws 1989, chapter 790, &sect; 51, as amended by Oregon Laws 1991, chapter 830, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Oregon Laws 1989, chapter 790, &sect; 51, as amended by Oregon Laws 1991, chapter 830, &sect; 9, provided that the maximum term of incarceration for a Class A misdemeanor could not exceed six months unless the trial judge expressly found substantial and compelling reasons to impose a longer term. The statute further provided that the limitations did not apply to certain enumerated offenses. On appeal, the court held that (1) its review of defendant's sentences was under ORS 138.040 and was limited to whether they exceeded the legal maximum or were cruel and unusual; (2) the six-month limitation argued by defendant did not apply to violations of ORS 163.415 and, although the sexual abuse statutes were recodified by Oregon Laws 1991, chapter 830, that recodification did not affect defendant's sentences because they were imposed under the statutes in force when the acts were committed; and (3) under ORS 161.615(1), the maximum term of imprisonment for each sexual abuse conviction was one year. The court accepted the State's concession that the trial court erred in enhancing defendant's criminal history score on the sodomy count by using convictions sentenced at the same proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court, Clackamas County (Oregon), which ordered forfeiture of cash seized from the claimant at the time of his arrest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to the claimant's motion for reconsideration, the court asked the State Court Administrator whether the legislature had appropriated funds to pay for transcripts in civil cases. Based on the response, the court found that although no amount within a &quot;mandated payments&quot; fund of the Judicial Department had been specifically earmarked for the payment of transcript fees, the establishment of that fund constituted an appropriation for that purpose. However, the court held that, in order to obtain a transcript at state expense under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 21.605(3)(a), an indigent appellant was required to make a prima facie showing that the portion of the transcript necessary to prosecute the appeal would reveal reversible error in the proceedings below. The claimant had not made such a showing. He also failed to show that the fee requirement unconstitutionally discriminated against a true class, as persons who could not afford the transcript fee did not constitute a class. The use of the discretionary term &quot;may&quot; in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 21.605(3)(a) indicated that the legislature did not intend to establish a right to a free appeal for every indigent civil litigant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appealed the decision of the Circuit Court, Lane County (Oregon), which dismissed his petition for post-conviction relief on the ground that his petition did not state a claim for relief following his conviction for unlawful possession of a firearm in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.250.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed an application for post-conviction relief. He alleged that his trial counsel was inadequate and that &sect; 166.250 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found that petitioner could have raised the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense in an answer or in a motion to dismiss, and that since he did neither, he had waived that defense. In connection with his claim of adequacy of trial counsel, petitioner was required to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, facts demonstrating that trial counsel failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment and that petitioner suffered prejudice as a result. The trial court erred because petitioner was entitled to a hearing on the merits as to whether his counsel failed to argue that the State failed to prove that the gun was concealed on petitioner's person. Further, no statute required petitioner to establish that trial or appellate counsel were inadequate in order to raise a constitutional challenge to the criminal statute for the first time in post-conviction proceedings. The absence of a statutory definition for the term &quot;concealed&quot; in &sect; 166.250 did not render that statute void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that part of the judgment dismissing petitioner's claim that his trial counsel was inadequate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the state read &sect; 162.051 as meaning that unreported campaign contributions were bribes. Defendant argued that the statute violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 because it was overbroad. The court observed that none of the allegations against defendant indicated that he made a campaign contribution. The court found that the facts he relied upon to support his demurrer did not appear on the face of the indictment. However, defendant was still entitled to assert his constitutional challenge by demurring to the indictment. The court found that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 162.051 did not criminalize unreported campaign contributions. The court held that &sect; 162.051 exempted any campaign contribution that was required to be reported by the donee under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 260, even if the donee failed to report it. However, the state could prosecute defendant for bribery if it could prove that he did not intend the pecuniary benefit he gave to a candidate as a campaign contribution. Because the statute did not proscribe that conduct, it did not unconstitutionally burden defendant's rights under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.

He argued that the trial court erred in finding that he was mentally ill under ORS 426.005(2) and in prohibiting him from purchasing or possessing a firearm under ORS 426.130(1)(b)(D).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A mental health examiner diagnosed appellant as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. Appellant believed that he was the Lord and had been chosen to rule the world. As the result of his delusions, appellant threatened serious bodily harm to his child, his pregnant wife, and her unborn child. His wife feared for her own safety and that of her children. A psychiatrist who examined appellant testified that there was an actual danger that he would act on his delusional beliefs. On the instant appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err in concluding that appellant was dangerous to others and was mentally ill. The court disagreed with appellant's assertion that for purposes of ORS 426.130(1)(b)(D) there was no evidence of actual violence or a past pattern of threats involving unlawful violence. It found a pattern of behavior involving threats of unlawful violence that resulted from appellant's delusional ideation. Because it was raised for the first time on appeal, the court declined to address appellant's argument that ORS 426.130(1)(b)(D) was unconstitutional as applied because it restricted his right to bear arms.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision from the District Court, Benton County (Oregon), which convicted defendant of knowingly setting sight bait within 15 feet of a leghold trap for carnivores, a class A misdemeanor. Defendant objected to the presentation by the State at the sentencing hearing of illegally obtained evidence that had been suppressed by another trial court in three cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant objected to the illegally obtained evidence, arguing that use of the evidence was unconstitutional, because it had been seized in violation of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The trial court allowed the State to present the evidence. The primary issue before the court was whether evidence seized in violation of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 could be considered in a sentencing hearing. The evidence had been previously suppressed on the ground that the officer had engaged in a &quot;warrantless illegal entry.&quot; The court found that if the illegally seized evidence was presented at the sentencing hearing, the length of incarceration or probation might be determined or increased as a result of evidence seized in violation of constitutional rights. The court concluded that the vindication of defendant's rights under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 required that the illegally seized evidence be suppressed at sentencing. The court held that the imposition of jail time as a condition of probation for misdemeanors committed after November 1, 1989, but before June 10, 1991, violated the prohibition against ex post facto laws. Thus, the trial court erred in ordering defendant to serve jail time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, two telecommunications public utilities that were regulated by respondent Public Utility Commission of Oregon (PUC), brought this action to challenge portions of the PUC rule codified at Or. Admin. R. 860-27-052, which governed the accounting treatment for affiliate transactions. It required that the utility's purchases be recorded at the lower of cost or market price while sales be recorded at the greater of cost or market price.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The rule was intended to prevent &quot;cross-subsidization,&quot; by which intracorporate transfers were artificially inflated or deflated and could thereby be reflected in the rate structure at figures that did not accurately reflect the cost to or gain by the utilities or the affiliates. The court upheld the rule. The rule was consistent with the PUC's general rulemaking authority under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 759.120. It governed the accounting treatment given to transactions between &quot;regulated and unregulated accounts&quot; as they affected the cost and gain profile of the regulated activity. The rule did not cause cross-subsidies, in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 759.030(5), by requiring either the regulated or unregulated account to absorb the shock of accounting entries that were not based on actual dollars spent or received. In the intracorporate transfer context, neither party actually gained or lost because the two parties were one. The rule did not give rise to a taking of shareholder property. That argument failed because it presupposed that the utilities were entitled to a return that was measured against something other than real investments, expenses, and profits.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with manslaughter in the second degree, driving under the influence of intoxicants, and reckless driving. The trial court admitted the hospital records, but because the state violated Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 132.580(1) it barred evidence about defendant's blood alcohol content and testimony from an examining physician as to his state of intoxication in the emergency room after the accident. On appeal, the court affirmed the admission of the hospital records, but otherwise reversed. Section 132.580(1) only required that the names of witnesses who were examined before the grand jury and persons whose reports were submitted under &sect; 132.320(2) be endorsed on the indictment. The toxicologist and the examining physician did not appear and testify before the grand jury. The hospital records were not reports under the statute. There was no violation of &sect; 132.580 and the sanction of excluding the evidence was improperly applied.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 163.673, and using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.670. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In executing a warrant for defendant's arrest for a narcotics violation, police kicked in a glass door, handcuffed defendant and his wife, and ordered them to lie on the floor. No Miranda warnings were given. Police recovered firearms in the search of the home. Defendant was taken to the police car. While the wife was still handcuffed, an officer asked her if there were any other weapons. The wife replied that there was a weapon in the couple's car and agreed to a search of the car. The child pornography was found in a black box in the car. The controlled substance was recovered in a subsequent search pursuant to a warrant based on the pornographic photographs. Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence and that the statutes on child pornography violated his constitutional rights. The court held that the Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 163.673 and 163.670 were not constitutionally vague or overbroad. The court agreed with the trial court that the wife's consent to search the car was coerced, but it disagreed that the search was justified as a safety measure. The court held that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer was a sole proprietor of a painting business. As an evangelical Christian, he believed that he had a duty to tell others, especially nonbelievers, about God and sinful conduct. That included informing others that, on the basis of elements of their lifestyles, they were sinners. The employer's &quot;witnessing&quot; was persistent because he believed that no one would ever be persuaded if he quit witnessing whenever a person lacked interest. After the employer discharged him for poor work performance, an employee filed an unlawful employment practice complaint with the board. The board concluded that the employer's religious advances constituted religious harassment. The court held that the decision deprived the employer of his rights under Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2 and 3. Protecting the sensibilities of a &quot;reasonable person,&quot; without more, was not the least restrictive means available to advance the government's interest when religious freedom was at stake.</SPAN></P>

Defendant did not have a license, nor had he applied for one. He claimed that the ordinance violated the free speech provisions of the state and federal constitutions. The court agreed, finding that the fact that the ordinance allowed some sales, while prohibiting defendant's sales, demonstrated that it reached his expression, without applying the same prohibition to other sales that were equally offensive to the city's regulatory objective of assuring that the streets and sidewalks were available for their principal purposes. The critical fact was not that the ordinance allowed some sales, but that it did not allow the sale of defendant's books. The ordinance did not proscribe or focus on an effect, but it proscribed the sale of particular commodities, including joke books, but allowed the sale of others. It regulated different exercises of the same commercial and communicative activity differently, on the basis of what was sold and communicated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court, Klamath County (Oregon), which convicted and sentenced defendant for delivery of a controlled substance (DCS) and possession of a controlled substance (PCS), pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 475.992. The trial court also overruled defendant's demurrer to his indictment, which had argued that the charged offenses were barred by state and federal constitutional ex post facto provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that until the legislature enacted a new sentencing scheme for drug offenses, there was no constitutionally valid category for his crimes. As a result, defendant argued that the effect of the new sentencing scheme was to create those crimes for the first time. Therefore, as applied to him, the new sentencing scheme was an ex post facto provision, because it made his acts greater crimes than when committed and increased the quantum of punishment. On appeal, however, the court upheld defendant's sentence and conviction. Specifically, the court determined that the new sentencing scheme codified at Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 475.996 did not violate the ex post facto clauses of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 21 or the federal constitution. Rather, the court held that the elements of the crimes of DCS and PCS under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 475.992 were the same and that the new legislation controlled only the sentencing factors that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 135.711 required the indictment to allege. Accordingly, the court concluded that the trial court properly overruled defendant's demurrer since the new legislation provided defendant with more protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment convicting and sentencing defendant for the delivery of a controlled substance (DCS) and possession of a controlled substance (PCS).</SPAN></P>

The owner had sought reversal of the city's orders on the grounds that ch. 24.80 violated the Due Process, Equal Protection, and Takings Clauses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner of several unoccupied residential buildings that the city had declared derelict and required to be registered pursuant to ch. 24.80 brought the instant writ of review proceeding, and sought reversal of the city's orders on the grounds that ch. 24.80 violated the constitutional Due Process, Equal Protection, and Takings Clauses. The trial court upheld the orders, and the court affirmed. There was no taking because the city was not requiring him, as he assumed in his complaint, to have the buildings reoccupied. Consequently, his challenge was a facial one, and his burden was to show that ch. 24.80, first, necessarily referred to rentals or other undesired occupation by third parties and, second, compelled the owner either to rent the buildings or demolish them. He did not succeed on either prong. The owner mistakenly identified an uncompelled potential consequence of a regulation as being part of the regulation. The city simply did not require the owner to lease his property to others, and he advanced no other basis for concluding that his property had been taken within the meaning of either constitution. The owner's due process and equal protection also lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's upholding the city's orders for the owner to register his unoccupied buildings as derelict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During defendant's trial, defendant moved for a mistrial on several occasions claiming that the prosecutors had engaged in misconduct. After the trial court denied the motions, the jury was unable to reach a verdict and a mistrial was declared. Therefore, defendant unsuccessfully moved to dismiss the charges on the ground of former jeopardy. On reconsideration of its earlier ruling dismissing defendant's appeal, the court modified its previous order holding that defendant did not have a right to a direct interlocutory appeal after the trial court denied the motion to dismiss the charges, and modified the previous order to delete costs. In pertinent part, the court determined that defendant's argument, that protections of the double jeopardy clause of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, became meaningless unless a defendant had a right to an interlocutory appeal, had no merit because the right to appeal in Oregon was a statutory right and not a constitutional right. Similarly, the court held that the equal protection clause of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, was not violated because the remedy of a direct interlocutory appeal was equally unavailable to all defendants.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because its inclusion of the words &quot;capable of&quot; forgery were unclear. The court disagreed and affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that defendant's conduct was squarely within the statute's prohibition. The court held that the key to a vagueness challenge was the statute's failure to provide a defendant with fair notice of the prohibited conduct. In this case, the court held that any person of ordinary intelligence would have no difficulty knowing that defendant's possession of the placards, if performed with the requisite intent, fell within the ambit of the statutory prohibition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with attempted assault in the fourth degree and harassment. At arraignment, the district attorney elected to try the cases as violations under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.565(2). Defendant's motion for a jury trial was denied, and in a trial to the court, he was found guilty on both charges. Defendant argued that he was denied his constitutional right to a jury trial under the Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 when the district attorney elected to try the cases as violations under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.656(2). Specifically, defendant claimed that pre-trial procedures, community condemnation and the historical perception of assaultive behavior as a &quot;crime,&quot; showed that assaultive behavior had &quot;criminal characteristics&quot; that precluded its prosecution without the constitutional safeguard of a jury trial. The court held that &sect; 161.565(2) permitted conduct that could be prosecuted as a misdemeanor to have be prosecuted as a violation. Defendant's conduct was not a crime, and the prosecution of the conduct was not a criminal prosecution. Defendant had no right under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's daughter accused him of sexual abuse and she was sent away to live with an aunt. Defendant took her away. He was stopped by police, and weapons were found in the car. A tape was also found on which defendant told his daughter that they were going to die. Defendant was convicted of kidnapping in the first degree with a firearm with intent to terrorize. The court affirmed. Evidence of the daughter's allegation of sexual abuse was properly admitted to show the states of mind of defendant and his daughter. It was the strongest evidence to rebut defendant's' testimony on his intent in taking the daughter away and why he made the threat. Further, the trial court limited the testimony to only the fact that the allegations had been made; the details were excluded. The fact that his first trial resulted in an acquittal on a charge of kidnapping with intent to cause physical injury and a hung jury on a charge of kidnapping with a firearm with intent to terrorize did not bar his second trial for the charge upon which the jury was hung. ORS 131.525(1)(b)(D) provided an exception to the bar of double jeopardy in such situation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that &sect; 167.355 was void for vagueness and, therefore, violated the federal Due Process Clause, and Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 20, 21. Defendant contended that the provision making it a crime for a person to be present as a spectator at an exhibition of fighting or preparations thereto was vague, because &quot;preparations thereto&quot; was not defined by the statute and allowed a jury to define it. Defendant's concerns about the general application of the statute were irrelevant because his conduct clearly came within the statutory language. Defendant's challenge under federal law was essentially identical to his state law challenge. Therefore, it was rejected for the same reasons the state law claim was. Defendant contended that the affidavit was insufficient to support a finding of probable cause, because the evidence did not demonstrate the reliability of the information from the unnamed informant. However, it was shown that the informant had provided accurate information in the past that the informant's information was extensively corroborated and, because the conduct involved an ongoing activity, the information was not stale.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both plaintiff developer and defendant county drainage district sought review of the judgment and decisions by the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon). The developer alleged that the trial court impermissible foreclosed a statutory lien on it as the damages did not come within the lienable rights of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 547.420. The district alleged that the trial court impermissibly dismissed its counterclaim for breach of contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer entered into an agreement with the county drainage district permitting the developer to install culverts in a slough and to build a road over it for access to a new development. The agreement provided that the developer would keep the culverts in good working order and if it failed to, the district could acquire a lien to the property under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 547.420. The district also alleged that the developer orally agreed to construct a bridge if necessary. The culverts were installed but due to concerns of a flood, the district proposed removing the culverts and replacing it with a bridge. The district then sent a demand letter to clean the culverts. When the developer did not clean them, the district removed the culverts, built the new bridge, and filed a lien against the developer for the new bridge. The court affirmed the dismissal of the district's breach of contract counterclaim because the claim was based on the oral agreement that could only be the basis of an implied contract, but reversed the judgment for the lien. The court held that &sect; 547.420 only permitted recovery for costs to clean a culvert, not for costs for a new bridge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raped a mentally retarded girl while he took her for drives. She could not say where the crimes occurred and, after defendant was extradited from Tennessee to Deschutes County, he was tried for rape in that county. Appealing from his convictions, defendant claimed that he was entitled to an acquittal because the State failed to prove that the rapes were committed in Deschutes County, and further that ORS 131.325, which permitted his trial in the county to which he had been extradited, was unconstitutional. The court held that the State was not required to prove the county in which the rapes were committed as an element of the offenses, and that ORS 131.325 relieved the State of the burden of proving the county in which the offenses were committed because that county could not readily be determined. It further held that ORS 131.325 did not violate Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, because the constitutional provision was intended to protect a defendant from being tried in an unfriendly neighborhood, away from his friends, witnesses, and neighborhood, and was not intended to shield him from trial where the county in which he committed his crimes could not reasonably be determined.</SPAN></P>

Marijuana plants and other evidence of the manufacture, delivery, and possession of marijuana were seized. The warrant was based on an affidavit by a police officer, who had talked with another officer. The other officer told the affiant about an unusual amount of nighttime traffic at defendant's residence and that all the windows but one were covered with black. The affidavit also stated that the residence used a large amount of electricity in comparison with other similar or larger houses. Affirming, the court determined there was a factual basis in the affidavit for the issuance of the search warrant. Although not all of defendant's windows were covered, the statement of someone other than the affiant could not be controverted under ORS 133.693. It did not matter that the inaccurate statement came from another police officer or police employee rather than an informant. Defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied. The affidavit contained sufficient facts to support the issuance of the warrant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state directed the transfer of $ 81 million from the workers compensation fund to the state general fund. The employers sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and sought certification as a class. The trial court denied such certification. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the employers were entitled to class certification because each of the considerations in Or. R. Civ. P. 32A, 32B weighed in favor of certification. There were questions relating to damages common to the class members, including the transfer's effect on dividends and premiums. The claims all arose from the same transaction and were based on the same contractual liability theory. Differences in damages could be resolved with the creation of subclasses under Or. R. Civ. P. 32G(2). A single adjudication was preferable to piecemeal litigation and potentially inconsistent awards. Although the class was large, administration would be less difficult than separate management of the claims of each policyholder. Finally, the claims of individual class members were not likely to be adequate to cover their litigation costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction for driving under the influence of intoxicants in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 813.010 by the District Court, Lincoln County (Oregon). Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the results of his field sobriety tests and his responses to questions from the arresting officers made after the testing stopped.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was stopped for committing traffic violations, the stopping officer noticed that defendant appeared intoxicated and asked defendant to perform field sobriety tests, noting that any refusal would be used against him in a court. Defendant did not perform well on the tests and after they were done, but before his arrest and the giving of a Miranda warning, the officer asked defendant several questions about his level of intoxication. Some of his answers were incriminating. The trial court convicted defendant of driving while under the influence of intoxicants. The court reversed that conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. The court held that field sobriety tests were both constitutional and did not compel a defendant to be a witness against himself in violation of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, and U.S. amend. V because the tests did not significantly impair a defendant's rights and did not violate a legitimate expectation of privacy. However, the court held that the trial court should have suppressed the statements made by defendant to the officer after the tests had finished because there was a clear break from the tests to an unlawful interrogation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the broad search warrants for his residence and the rental properties were unconstitutional general warrants under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The trial court concluded that none of the items under the part of the warrant that defendant challenged were offered in evidence. Defendant did not dispute the finding; therefore, the court held that if part of the warrant was not sufficiently specific, its invalidity was moot. Defendant contended that count one of the indictment which charged an ORICO violation lacked the specificity required by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 132.550(7), and of the Oregon and United States Constitutions. The court found that the indictment was specific as to the periods of time when the offenses occurred and described each in detail; therefore the court held that denial of the motion to dismiss was not error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 236.380 codified a measure adopted by the voters, which effectively repealed an executive order prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation. The board of higher education promulgated Or. Admin. Rs. 580-22-050, 580-15-0101, 580-15-065, to comport with the statute. The employee filed a proceeding under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 183.400 to determine the validity of the rules. The board then amended its rules so that they were identical to rules in effect before the passage of the statute, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The court held the last-adopted rules valid. The statute violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8; therefore, the statute did not limit the board's authority to promulgate the rules that were adopted after the proceeding was filed. Speech and status in the context of the statute were inextricably intertwined. In the absence of speech or communicative expression of some kind, the nature of a person's sexual orientation would rarely be known. Thus, the statute's practical effect was to chill speech and other expression and to severely limit open communication, violation of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court, Grant County (Oregon), which granted petitioner post-conviction relief. The circuit court held that, because Or. Const. art. VII (amended), &sect; 5(2) mandated a seven-person grand jury, the prosecutor's action of excusing one of the grand jurors from attendance at the session in which evidence against petitioner was presented and an indictment returned against him rendered the indictment void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State contended that only five jurors need have been present at a grand jury meeting and that they were able to return an indictment if they unanimously concurred. The State argued that the prosecutor's conduct was a violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 132.110(3) and not a constitutional violation. Petitioner was entitled to post-conviction relief only if the violation of &sect; 132.110(3) also constituted a constitutional violation. The express language of Or. Const. art. VII (amended), &sect; 5(2) required that a grand jury consist of seven persons, but allowed five to find an indictment. A grand jury panel of five or six jurors might not always have reached the same conclusion as if there were seven members. Or. Const. art. VII (amended), &sect; 5(2) promoted a deliberative process that allowed consideration of minority viewpoints, thereby insulating an accused from biased or overzealous prosecution. Thus, the court held that Or. Const. art. VII (amended), &sect; 5(2) mandated that seven grand jurors hear and consider all of the evidence presented before a valid indictment could have been found. Petitioner was entitled to dismissal of the indictment because only six grand jurors heard the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court, Lane County (Oregon), which convicted defendant of perjury, a violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 162.065. Defendant assigned error to the trial court's denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal. Defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of perjury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A perjury charge arose from defendant's testimony during his trial for sodomy committed against his grandchild. The State asked defendant on cross-examination whether he had ever been mean to her. Defendant responded: &quot;I've never been mean to any of my kids. My grandkids or my kids, never, neither one. No sir.&quot; During defendant's perjury trial, the State called four of defendant's children and grandchildren to prove the falsity of his answer. The witnesses testified that they had been sexually abused by defendant. The court found defendant guilty. Defendant argued that his testimony was not a proper basis for a perjury charge because a person's expression of an opinion cannot form the basis of a perjury conviction without proof, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the witness did not hold that opinion, no matter how unreasonable the opinion might be to others. Reversing the conviction, the court found that a pedophile may not believe that his conduct is &quot;mean&quot; or, even, wrong. The court found that because the State presented no evidence that even remotely suggested that defendant did not sincerely believe that he had not been mean, it failed to prove a misrepresentation.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed. In reversing the trial court's order, the court held that the Eugene Municipal Code &sect; 5.005(1)(b), which adopted Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 815.225 violated Or. Const. art.

The court determined that the ordinance was so broad that it made honking unlawful if a motorist honked as a friendly greeting to a bystander. The court noted that the ordinance was not limited solely to circumstances of noise or abuse that implicated the public interest. The court concluded that the ordinance regulated far more behaviour than the city argued it was intended to regulate and therefore was constitutionally overbroad and violated defendants' right to free expression.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that he had been a felon, but that Or. Rev. Stat. 166.270 violated the ex post facto clauses of the Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 21 and U.S. Const. art. I, &sect;9 because it retrospectively imposed additional penalties for the past felony. On appeal by the State, the court reversed.

The deputy testified that defendant refused to take field sobriety tests. Defendant moved to suppress evidence of his refusal to perform the tests. The trial court allowed the motion upon the ground that the deputy did not adequately advise defendant of his rights. The deputy told defendant that his refusal &quot;could be used against him as evidence in court.&quot; The deputy did not employ the precise language of ORS 813.136. On appeal, the court held that the variation in the form or order of the deputy's advice was not fatal. The context of his advice would have led a reasonable person to understand that &quot;in court&quot; referred to a legal proceeding regarding the DUII. The court held that ORS 813.135 and ORS 813.136 extended the implied consent law to field sobriety tests.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The farmer argued that the board of appeals erred by upholding the county's finding without requiring it to apply a &quot;balancing test&quot; to the evidence in arriving at the finding that the land was not unsuitable for agricultural production. The question before the county was not what weight the standard itself should be given, but what weight to give the evidence tending to show that the standard was or was not satisfied. The court held that the farmer's argument was self-defeating because the county necessarily and obviously did balance and weigh the evidence. The farmer's real complaint was that the way in which the county weighed the evidence did not balance in his favor. However, if there was substantial evidence in the whole record to substantiate the finding, neither the board of appeals nor the court could disturb it. The denial of the permit to build a nonfarm dwelling on the basis that the land had to be farmed and due to its size had to be farmed in combination with adjacent lands was not a taking of the farmer's property because it did not compel him to sell his land.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court overruled defendant's demurrer to the indictment, in which he argued that the scheme or network allegation was unconstitutionally vague, and convicted him on all charges. Agreeing with defendant's grounds for demurrer, the court held that the circuit court erred in overruling it, reversed the conviction, and remanded the case with instructions to dismiss the indictment. The state contended that even disregarding the &quot;scheme or network&quot; allegation, the indictment still charged controlled substance offenses, so the circuit court properly overruled the demurrer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly before the claimant's aggravation rights expired (nearly five years after his injury), his employer received chart notes from his chiropractor. The employer treated the notes as a claim for aggravation, which it denied. Then, in a hearing on the denial that was held shortly after the effective date of amendments to ORS 656.273(3), the referee, applying the amendments, affirmed the employer's denial. The board adopted the referee's order and affirmed the decision. The court affirmed. The court held that, per Oregon Laws 1990, chapter 2, &sect; 54, the 1990 amendments applied to all claims existing or arising on or after the effective date, regardless of the date of injury. Further, because Oregon Laws 1990, chapter 2, &sect; 54(2) saved some cases that were heard before the effective date from being heard by the amendments, the fact that this case was not heard before then made it subject to the amendments. The court also held that there was substantial evidence to support the board's finding that the claimant did not have a compensable aggravation. Finally, the court dispensed with the claimant's argument that retroactive application of the 1990 amendments was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment in favor of the county official, and declared the initiative invalid. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court, and remanded the matter with instructions to dismiss the action. The court held that the action was not justiciable. The voters had already passed the initiative, and the sponsor had no more authority over and responsibility for the initiative after its passage. No relief could have been directed at the sponsor that would have rendered the cause justiciable. There was no defendant in the county official's case that would have made a meaningful judicial remedy possible. The action had to be dismissed because the absence of a justiciable controversy in the declaratory judgment action was a jurisdictional defect.</SPAN></P>

The court also did not find that his petition alleged facts that, if supported by evidence, were going to establish that the grounds for relief could not reasonably have been raised timely. Petitioner alleged that his trial attorney was ineffective, because he did not file a demurrer challenging the constitutionality of the &quot;scheme or network&quot; language in the charging instrument.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court, Union County (Oregon), which dismissed two indictments that had been filed against defendant for theft. Defendant, a Department of Transportation employee, claimed that the indictments should be dismissed under U.S. Const. amend. V and Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, after he was forced to testify against himself during Department termination proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted, in three separate indictments. The Department thereafter notified him that it was commencing dismissal proceedings. Under Or. Admin. R. 105-80-003, defendant was entitled to an informal pretermination hearing and also a more formal, post-termination appeal. Although he was not required to appear at the pretermination hearing, Rule 105-80-003(6)(d) precluded defendant from refuting or offering evidence in mitigation at the later hearing if he did not appear at the earlier one. Defendant appeared and testified at the pretermination hearing. He then successfully filed a motion in the trial court to dismiss two of the indictments on that ground that his testimony was compelled within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment and Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. He claimed, therefore, that he had transactional immunity. In reversing, the court held that the Department's procedures compelled defendant to testify against himself in violation of his constitutional rights. The Oregon Constitution, however, did not automatically grant transactional immunity for violations of the right against self-incrimination. Defendant's remedy was to file a suppression motion.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners conceded that the DEQ had the general authority to make the rules. Petitioners' procedural argument was that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 459.298 required the DEQ to follow a process that violated the Oregon Constitution and that the statute in its entirety was therefore invalid, so no rules could have been made under it. Petitioners argued in the alternative that if the procedures were permissible then the rules were invalid because the DEQ had not followed those procedures. Petitioner further argued that if the rules were made by a valid procedure, they were nonetheless invalid because they impermissibly discriminated against interstate commerce in violation of the United States Constitution. The court held that the rules were valid because before the court could have said that the rules were unconstitutional, petitioners would have had to show that the fees were excessive for the purposes for which they were collected or that there was no sufficient relation between the measure employed and the extent or manner of use of the state provided service.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to seven counts of negotiating a bad check, a Class A misdemeanor. Defendant was sentenced to 90 days in the county jail on each conviction with the sentences to be served consecutively.

Furthermore, defendant's history showed a pattern of check-related offenses in which he used aliases, invalid addresses, different Social Security numbers, and different dates of birth. The court concluded that the trial court's 90-day sentence was well within the maximum authorized by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.545 and that it was not so disproportionate to the offense as to shock the conscience of fair-minded individuals. Therefore, the trial court's decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's decision that sentenced defendant to 90 days in the county jail for each of his seven convictions of writing bad checks was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Because petitioner was not allowed a hearing under Or. Rev.

The court reversed the dismissal of petitioner's application, concluding that a timely petition was not prerequisite to the filing of an untimely petition that raised meritorious issues that could not reasonably have been raised within the 120-day limitation period and that the post-conviction court erred by dismissing the petition without a hearing. The limitation period began to run when the court granted petitioner's motion to dismiss his appeal. Petitioner was not on constructive notice that the court had granted his motion until his attorney informed him more than 120 days later, and he filed his petition within a week after that date. If the allegations in his petition were true, he could not reasonably have raised any grounds for relief within the limitations period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to DUII, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 813.010. The District Court, Multnomah County (Oregon), suspended imposition of sentence and placed him on probation. One of the conditions of probation required him to pay $ 200 in restitution. Defendant objected on the ground that there was no evidence in the record to support that or any other figure. The trial court entered a sentencing order, including restitution of $ 200. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because defendant pled guilty, his appeal was governed by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 138.050 and 138.053, which limited the court's review to whether the disposition exceeded the maximum allowable by law or was unconstitutionally cruel and unusual. The question before the court was: What was a disposition that &quot;exceeded the maximum allowable by law&quot;? The court held that disposition was legally defective and, therefore, exceeded the maximum allowable by law if it was not imposed consistently with the statutory requirements. The court overruled State v. Peters, 104 Or. App. 582, 801 P.2d 904 (1990); State v. King, 107 Or. App. 249, 810 P.2d 413 (1991); and State v. Ross, 108 Or. App. 560, 815 P.2d 719 (1991). The court noted that the record revealed that the State failed to investigate and present to the trial court, prior to or at the time of sentencing, evidence of the nature and amount of damages, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.106(1). The burden was on the State to prove the amount of restitution, and it failed to do that. With that, and because defendant objected to the sufficiency of the evidence but was not afforded a hearing, the restitution order exceeded the maximum allowable by law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was affirmed, the order of restitution was vacated, and the case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the District Court, Washington County (Oregon), which convicted defendant of carrying a concealed weapon violating Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.240 and denied defendant's motion for acquittal on the grounds that &sect; 166.240 was applicable to a person who carried a concealed switchblade within the confines of his own home and &sect; 166.240 did not violate Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 27.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers went to defendant's residence to execute an arrest warrant. Defendant's wife consented to a search and defendant was found hiding. Before placing defendant into the police car he was frisked and a switchblade was found in his pocket. At trial, an officer testified that the arrest was predicated on defendant's having carried a switchblade in his pocket both inside and outside the house. On review, the court held that a switchblade was the type of weapon that came within the meaning of &quot;arms&quot; in Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 27, and accordingly, the &quot;mere possession or carrying of&quot; a switchblade could not be absolutely proscribed by the legislature. Possession of a billy club inside one's home was protected by the constitutional right to bear arms in defense of one's person and property. &quot;Mere possession&quot; even outside the home was protected. Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 27 was not qualified as to place. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.240 was applied unconstitutionally. The concealing within one's own home was not the type of unrestrained rights-exercising that posed a clear threat to public safety. Section 166.240 applied only to the carrying of concealed weapons outside one's own home.</SPAN></P>

Under the sentencing guidelines, assault in the first degree was in crime seriousness category 10 if the victim did not substantially contribute to the commission of the offense by precipitating the attack. Or. Admin. R. 253-04-002. According to defendant, the phrase &quot;precipitating the attack&quot; was unconstitutionally vague on its face. The court, however, ruled that the language of the subcategory provided adequate notice to a person that an unprovoked assault was a more serious offense. Defendant also argued that the sentencing court erred in imposing an upward departure sentence of 180 months. The State conceded that the sentencing court erred in relying on three aggravating factors: violence toward the victim, use of a weapon, and permanent injury to the victim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several counts in the indictment alleged that defendant's conduct was part of a drug manufacture scheme. Defendant demurred to the counts, arguing that the &quot;scheme or network&quot; allegations were unconstitutionally vague. The trial court overruled the demurrer, and defendant pled guilty. He did not dispute the grid block or the presumptive sentence of 16 to 18 months. The trial court imposed a 16-month prison term. After defendant's sentence, the Oregon Court of Appeals held that the &quot;scheme or network&quot; language violated Article I, sections 20 and 21, of the Oregon Constitution. On appeal, defendant attacked the overruling of his demurrer and the imposition of sentence. Affirming, the court held that it had no authority to review the trial court's ruling on the demurrer because defendant had pled guilty. Although ORS 138.222(4)(b) allowed review of the classification of the crime seriousness on a sentencing appeal, ORS 138.222(2)(d) precluded review of a sentence imposed under a plea agreement. In addition, defendant's claim was not reviewable under ORS 138.222(4)(b), nor was it reviewable under ORS 138.222(4)(a) as a failure by the sentencing court to follow the requirements of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record owners obtained an assignment from the timber rights owner of his interest prior to the natural expiration of that interest, but did not record the assignment. However, the deed records showed that they owned the property and the timber rights by virtue of the eventual reversion of the timber rights. The timber rights owner had failed to pay property taxes assessed against the timber interest, and the county foreclosed its tax lien on the timber. Even though the record owners owned both the land and the timber by that time, they were not named as parties or given notice of the foreclosure, and the county obtained a tax deed. They then sold a portion of the land to the purchasers, who discovered the county's deed to the timber and purchased the interest, later announcing a plan to log the timber. The record owners filed the instant action and the purchasers counterclaimed to quiet title. The trial court granted the record owners' motion for summary judgment, and the purchasers appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the record owners' interest was a matter of public record and the foreclosure without notice deprived them of their property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.510.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner was convicted of rape in the third degree. More than 120 days later, he filed a petition for post-conviction relief, claiming that he was denied his rights to due process and effective assistance of counsel because his attorney did not inform him of a potential statutory defense to the rape charge. The trial court dismissed the petition on the ground that it was barred by the 120-day statute of limitations in &sect; 138.510. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order. The court held that the petitioner had the sole responsibility of investigating the grounds for a collateral attack on his conviction, so his attorney's omission did not excuse the late filing of the petition. The court determined that the 120-day statute of limitations in &sect; 138.510 did not violate defendant's right to due process or impermissibly suspend the writ of habeas corpus in violation of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 23.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of dissolution ordered the father to pay child support through the Department of Human Resources. The father moved to dismiss the mother's motion to modify his support obligations on the ground that it did not allege a substantial change of circumstances, which he asserted was a prerequisite to modification under former ORS 25.285 (Oregon), as well as ORS 107.135. The father also argued that if such a showing was not required for parents whose support was payable through an enforcing agency as it was for all other parents, then former ORS 25.285 was unconstitutional in violation of his equal protection rights. On appeal, the court held that the classification created by former ORS 25.285 was created by the statute itself rather than by virtue of the characteristics of the class, therefore, the statute was not unconstitutional. Under ORS 25.285, the class defined by parents whose support was payable through an enforcing agency was simply a natural result of law-making. Such a classification did not violate the Oregon Constitution. Because the statute was not unconstitutional, the circuit court erred by dismissing the mother's motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was subject to deportation because he was an alien who had been convicted of possession of drugs. A federal agent obtained an administrative warrant for defendant's arrest. Defendant allowed the agent and others with the agent to enter his home and consented to a search, where they found pistols. Defendant contended that the arrest warrant was invalid under the Fourth Amendment and Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 because it was unsupported by affirmation, and he sought to have the pistol suppressed. The State argued that the warrant did not require an affirmation. On appeal, the court reversed the decision, finding that for state prosecutions in state court, an arrest warrant was invalid if it was not supported by affirmation. The court rejected the State's contention that a certified copy of defendant's prior conviction satisfied the affirmation requirement. Further, the agent's sole purpose in bringing members of the regional narcotics task force with him was to have them look for evidence of violations of state narcotics law.

Defendant demurred to that indictment on the ground that the language was unconstitutionally vague.

The district attorney threatened to refer defendant's case to federal authorities unless defendant pleaded guilty to the state charges. Defendant accepted the offer. The court classified defendant according to the guideline classification for scheme and network convictions. Two weeks later that classification was found unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that because defendant did not make a claim that the sentencing court failed to comply with the requirements of the law in imposing his sentence, the court could not pursuant to Or.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the District Court of Clackamas County (Oregon) for telephonic harassment in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;166.090(1)(a), arguing that the trial court erred by denying his motions for directed verdict and for judgment of acquittal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was based upon three telephone calls he made in a single day to a 9-1-1 operator. During the first call, defendant initially said, &quot;Huh?&quot; During the second call, he used profane language. In the last call, he requested police assistance because of an altercation involving guns and knives. When the police officers arrived at defendant's home and questioned defendant, he responded that he was &quot;sitting here drinking whiskey and dialing 9-1-1 for entertainment.&quot; On appeal, defendant argued that his conduct did not violate Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.090(1)(a), because he communicated to the 9-1-1 operator after each call was answered. He also challenged the statute's constitutionality. Upholding the conviction, the court held that there was sufficient evidence to conclude that defendant had the requisite intent under &sect; 166.090(1)(a); specifically, that he had no communicative purpose when he placed the calls. The statute did not violate the First Amendment or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 because it regulated the conduct of placing the calls and not the content of defendant's comments to the 9-1-1 operator. The statute was not overbroad or vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision from the Circuit Court, Benton County (Oregon), which convicted defendant of first degree burglary and second degree kidnapping.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first denied defendant's claim that the Sentencing Guidelines violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 15. The Guidelines' express acknowledgment that one of the primary purposes for imposing sentences was to provide punishment appropriate to an offense did not render them vindictive and violative of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 15. The Guidelines also met the proportionality requirement imposed by Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 by reserving in incremental fashion progressively longer periods of incarceration for more serious crimes and the most recidivist offenders; criminal history and seriousness of the offense were factors necessary to be considered in imposing a sentence proportionate to the offense and offender. Finally, the court held that the Guidelines did not violate Or. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, because a legislative determination that a certain sentence was required to be imposed did not violate the separation of powers requirement. The legislature's power to set criminal penalties did not impair the power of the judiciary to adjudicate, pronounce a judgment, or carry it into effect. Judges still had discretion to give weight to mitigating and aggravating factors of each case.</SPAN></P>

The Department argued that the searches were limited to persons employed in the operation of prisons. In that context, it contended that the authority to search was implicit in the statutory directives to Department to provide for the health and security of persons confined in state prisons. The court noted that not all agencies might have found implicit authority to search from a general legislative directive for the agency to provide for health and safety. However, given the serious risks posed by drugs or weapons in prison, the court concluded that the legislative directive to the Department to provide for safety carried with it the implicit authorization to intercept contraband and to do so, if necessary, by means of a search. The court held that the limits in the rules, including the requirement that searches be based on reasonable suspicion, sufficiently limited the Department's discretion and provided the measure of control over the search that would have been provided by a warrant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of an order of the Circuit Court, Jackson County (Oregon) that set aside defendant's conviction for sexual abuse in the first degree, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.225.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged the trial court's set aside of defendant's prior conviction of sexual abuse in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.425, and asserted that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.225 as amended in 1989 did not apply to defendant's conviction. The court reversed and found that the plain language of the amended version of &sect; 137.225(5)(a)(D) explicitly provided that the statute did not apply to convictions of sexual abuse in the first degree under &sect; 163.425. The court found that the key issue was whether the legislature intended the amended statute to apply to defendant's conviction that occurred prior to the enactment of the amended statute. Defendant asserted that application of the amended statute was a violation of the state and federal constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto legislation. The court noted that &sect; 137.225(8) explicitly stated the legislature's intent that the amended statute apply to convictions that occurred prior to the statute's enactment. The court also held that the elimination of the set aside remedy for sexual abuse was not an ex post facto punishment because it did not increase his punishment, forestall parole, or extend his probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed because the legislature intended retroactive application of the amended statute, and because the application of the amended statute to defendant's convictions was not contrary to the constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition merely alleged that plaintiff was a police officer who could not be terminated without just cause and that he was terminated. The court held that it was insufficient because it only generally told the circuit court of the issues involved. Although the court could infer from the recitation in the petition that the officer was complaining that he had been terminated without just cause, the petition did not inform the court of the evidence to be addressed or provide sufficient facts to allow a determination of whether a writ should be issued ex parte. The officer alleged that defendants made a finding or order not supported by substantial evidence in the whole record, but the petition was silent as to what findings were being attacked. He alleged that defendants &quot;improperly construed the applicable law,&quot; but the petition did not reveal what was improperly construed or what legal standard should have been used. Because the trial court had no way to determine whether defendants had exercised their functions erroneously, and defendants had no way to respond to the petition, the trial court should have granted defendants' motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

A citation was issued for defendant to show cause why he should not be held in contempt. The trial court treated the matter as a criminal contempt. Although neither defendant nor the State called witnesses or presented evidence, the trial court found that defendant had &quot;purposely and willfully failed&quot; to comply with the support order and imposed a suspended sentence and a year of probation. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court shifted the burden of proof from the State to him in violation of the Due Process Clause. The court agreed, holding that the trial court impermissibly shifted the burden of proving defendant's ability or inability to pay from the State to defendant. Moreover, the State's evidence was insufficient to establish a prima facie case of contempt, including the ability to pay element, because there was no evidence to support a finding that defendant's failure to pay child support was &quot;willful.&quot; Because the facts did not show that defendant was capable of complying with the support order, there was insufficient evidence of willfulness to find him guilty of criminal contempt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff victim filed an action against defendant manufacturer for product liability after the three-wheeled all-terrain vehicle the victim was driving flipped over. Pursuant to a jury verdict, the Circuit Court of Multnomah County (Oregon) entered a judgment in favor of the victim in the amount of $ 5,735,512.31. The manufacturer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that evidence of excerpts from several internal staff memoranda and an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking of the Consumer Product Safety Commission regarding all-terrain vehicles was properly admitted. It was admitted not to prove that the vehicle was defective, but for the limited purpose of showing the manufacturer's knowledge of the purportedly harmful characteristics of its product. The court also found that the punitive damages award did not violate Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 because the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment did not apply in civil actions between private parties. Regarding the punitive damages award, the jury's discretion was exercised within reasonable constraints and the trial court's restrictive instructions adequately guided the jury during its consideration of the manufacturer's liability. Accordingly, the award of punitive damages did not violate due process. Finally, the manufacturer's motion for a new trial was properly denied because the newly discovered evidence probably would not have changed the result. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's constitutional attacks, holding that the Intimidation Law: (1) was directed at conduct rather than speech; (2) was not vague based on its perception element, which focused on the actor's motivation rather than the victim's status; and (3) satisfied due process by providing notice of the prohibited conduct.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court, Deschutes County (Oregon), convicted defendant of burglary in the first degree and theft in the first degree in violation of ORS 164.225 and ORS 164.055 (Oregon), respectively. He appealed, seeking review of the circuit court's order denying his motion for a new trial, which he filed on the ground of newly discovered evidence. The appeal raised a question of whether the order was appealable under ORS 138.040 (Oregon).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that there was no authority to review the denial of defendant motion for a new trial because the order denying it was filed after judgment was entered. The court agreed, even though ORS 138.040 gave defendant a right to appeal from a judgment or order that was described in ORS 138.053 (Oregon). There was nothing in ORS 138.040, the court ruled, authorizing a review of the post-judgment order denying defendant's motion. The court also noted that a post-judgment order was not an intermediate order, that ORS 136.535(1) (Oregon) allowed a motion for a new trial to be filed after judgment, and that ORS 138.071(2) delayed a judgment's effective date for purposes of appeal while a motion for new trial was pending. Those statutes, however, did not expressly or by implication authorize review of a post-judgment order denying a motion for a new trial. In addition, the court determined that ORS 138.053 specifically limited the type of post-judgment orders that could be appealed, which were subject to the limitations on review in ORS 138.040(1). The court also pointed out that appeals were allowed only when provided by statute and that the statutes had to be strictly applied.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: 1) although the trial court was not required to state its reasons for imposing the consecutive sentences, or make special findings on the record, &sect; 137.123(4) required the trial court to determine whether consecutive sentences were authorized by the statute; 2) there was no indication in the trial court's ruling imposing the consecutive sentences that the trial court made the finding that the consecutive sentences were authorized; therefore, 3) because the court's review was not de novo, and the trial court had not imposed the sentences in accordance with &sect; 137.123(4), the sentences were vacated, and the matter remanded for resentencing after a determination by the trial court of whether the consecutive sentences were authorized by the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The execution of defendant's sentence was suspended, and he was placed on probation for felony driving while his license was suspended for a period of three years. The trial court issued a bench warrant for defendant's arrest in 1980. Defendant was arraigned on the probation violation in 1989. The trial court entered an order that continued defendant's probation under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.550(1)(a) and imposed additional conditions. Defendant argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because a valid arrest warrant had not been issued within the period of probation. The court affirmed because the bench warrant that was issued for defendant's arrest complied with the requirements of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.060 and, therefore, the trial court retained jurisdiction to hold a hearing in 1989. When read with Or. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, the State contested the orders by which the Circuit Court of Clatsop County (Oregon) sustained defendants' demurrers to their indictments for drug-related offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the sentence enhancement provisions of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.120(2), pertaining to crimes occurring as part of a drug cultivation, manufacture or delivery scheme or network, were unconstitutional. When defendants' motions carried before the trial court, the prosecution appealed to no avail. Defendants properly used demurrers to challenge the validity of penalty provisions that they contested. Facts constituting the crime were for the jury's resolution, while facts characterizing defendant were for the sentencing judge. Similarly, facts going to the criminal acts for which defendants would be punished had to be proved to the jury's satisfaction. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.120(2) identified an issue to be decided by the trier of fact. The statute violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 20, 21 because it was so uncertain or unclear that judges and juries had unbridled discretion to decide what conduct came within it, and it did not provide notice of the forbidden conduct. Under this second criterion, the statute was void because it was susceptible of an abundance of possible meanings and applications, all or none of which might be the intended ones.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A landowner deeded land to a railroad for a right-of-way. The deed provided that if the land was abandoned or was no longer used as a railroad, the rights of the grantee would be deemed terminated and would revert to the grantor. The landowner's successor did not record its interest in the railroad strip by a deadline established by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 105.772 for such recordation. Later, the railroad line was abandoned. The landowner's successors sued the railroad's successors for trespass and conversion. The trial court entered judgment for the railroad's successors. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that &sect; 105.772 was not an ex post facto law in violation of U.S. Const. at. I, &sect; 9 or Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 21 because only criminal laws could be ex post facto laws. Neither did the statute unconstitutionally impair any contractual obligation because there was a good reason for the law, i.e., to record possible clouds on title. Neither did the statute effect a taking. Although it effectively extinguished the landowner's successors' rights in the land, it was not done for public use. Finally, the statute was not unconstitutionally retroactive.</SPAN></P>

At the trial on the new indictment, defendant moved for dismissal on the basis of former jeopardy, arguing that the previous acquittal barred the second prosecution for the same offense. The court agreed that the granting of a motion for judgment of acquittal on the grounds that the indictment did not set out facts sufficient to establish a crime barred a subsequent prosecution for the same offense. Had defendant demurred to the original indictment, the granting of his motion would not have raised a former jeopardy bar. Controlling Oregon case law prohibited the court from treating defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal as a demurrer.

The Board refused to consider the requests and held that &sect; 656.278 did not permit it to award permanent disability benefits on its own motion. The workers sued in mandamus. The circuit court denied relief. The Board acted properly. The workers argued that because it no longer permitted own motion review of permanent disability, &sect; 656.278 violated Or. Const. art.

The imposition of limitations on the bringing of a workers' compensation claim did not infringe a claimant's constitutional rights, and it was a permissible legislative function to balance the possibility of outlawing legitimate claims against the public need that at some definite time there be an end to potential litigation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant pleaded guilty to nine crimes, the circuit court orally sentenced him to four concurrent indeterminate terms, not to exceed 10 years. Final judgment was delayed, pending defendant's taking a polygraph examination. Defendant was transferred to a state penitentiary. Transport orders did not mention any minimum term. Defendant sought clarification of the sentence, but as he had not then yet taken a polygraph examination, no final judgment had been entered. The circuit court subsequently stated in a hearing that two of the terms included minimum terms of 2.5 years. Final judgments were then prepared and entered. Defendant contended that the trial judge's oral pronouncement did not include a minimum term and that once the sentence had been imposed and he began to serve it, the sentencing court illegally modified his sentence in the written judgment. As defendant pleaded guilty, the appeal was governed by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.050. Because defendant did not claim that the sentence imposed either exceeded the maximum allowed by law or was unconstitutionally cruel and unusual, on direct appeal, the court could not review his assertion of error.</SPAN></P>

He later applied for reinstatement pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 659.415, 659.420, and also applied for a promotion to sergeant. The county refused reinstatement on the ground that the investigator's position had been eliminated, and refused to promote him, contending that a labor agreement required that sergeants belong to the union. The county then filed an action seeking a declaration that the investigator was a state employee. The investigator claimed that he was entitled to reinstatement and that the county's interpretation of the labor agreement violated his equal protection rights. The trial court granted the county partial summary judgment. The investigator appealed. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment in part. The court rejected the reinstatement claim, noting that the county had proved that the investigator was discharged for reasons unrelated to his injury. The court found, however, that ambiguities in the labor agreement, including the scope of the union membership requirement, made summary judgment inappropriate regarding the investigator's application for a promotion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to serve a term of 60 days in jail on a misdemeanor conviction, and she was released early under a furlough release agreement due to jail overcrowding. Under the furlough release agreement, defendant was released on the condition that she was to have (1) resided at her sister's home, (2) returned to the residence by a certain time each night, and (3) that she was to have reported to the jail three times a week by phone. Defendant's conviction was had on her stipulation that she failed to return to the residence by the designated time on a given date, that she neglected to check in with the jail by phone on three occasions, and that she failed to comply with a deputy's demand that she return to jail. On appeal, the court affirmed. Under &sect; 162.135(2), defendant remained within the custody of the sheriff and was constructively confined to a correctional facility under the terms of her furlough release agreement. Defendant's violation of the furlough release agreement constituted an escape under &sect;&sect; 162.135(4), 162.155.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a licensed wholesale fish dealer. An officer of the Oregon State Police Fish and Game Division suspected that defendant was shipping roe taken from sturgeon longer than the legal limit. The officer was at an airport when he saw a package delivered from defendant's business for shipment. The invoice on the package stated that it contained raw sturgeon eggs. The officer testified that packages of roe were generally shipped from the airport within an hour after receipt. He immediately opened the box, seized its contents, and confirmed by laboratory analysis the next day that the roe came from a single sturgeon skein and that the sturgeon's length exceeded the legal limit.Defendant moved to suppress the evidence, arguing that the officer's warrantless search and seizure was unconstitutional. The trial court granted the motion, and the state appealed. The court agreed with the trial court's conclusion that there was probable cause to justify the search. However, the court also agreed with the trial court that the state had not established that there were exigent circumstances. The state did not show that there was a justification for seizing the package without a warrant.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the employee was not required to seek a discretionary hearing from the board under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 183.410 before filing her petition. The employee's request to uphold the rules necessarily put the question of the rules' validity before the court. Thus, the court had jurisdiction over the petition. Because recently adopted Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 236.380(2) permitted discrimination based on sexual orientation, because &sect; 236.382(2) was presumed to be constitutional, and because the board and the state declined to take a position in respect to the effect of &sect; 236.382(2) on the rules, a justiciable controversy existed. Therefore, the court denied the motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guardian was appointed after the children's father was incarcerated. Before his incarceration, the father received ADC for himself and the children. The AFSD concluded that the children were not eligible for continued assistance because the guardian did not qualify as a &quot;caretaker relative&quot; under Or. Admin. R. 461-05-410. It also ruled that the denial of benefits was not unconstitutional. The guardian appealed from that decision, which was affirmed. The court rejected her argument that Rule 461-05-410 was more restrictive than the eligibility standards contained in 45 C.F.R. &sect; 233.90(c)(1)(v). In that regard, the guardian, not their father, was responsible for the children's day-to-day care. Therefore, they were also ineligible under &sect; 233.90(c)(1)(v). The AFSD had also provided an adequate explanation for its refusal to waive the eligibility requirements. Furthermore, Or. Admin. R. 461-05-410 did not deprive the children of equal protection. In that regard, the rule's distinction between children who lived with caretaker relatives and those who did not was rationally related the to AFSD's mission under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 601 to strengthen families.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court denied his petition and he appealed, contending that his knowledge that some minimum sentence could be imposed was not tantamount to his knowing that a 10 year minimum sentence could be imposed. The court reversed the order, holding that in order to waive knowingly and voluntarily the rights that were forfeited by entering a plea of guilty or no contest, the inmate was required to have been appraised on the full potential exposure to incarceration. The inmate's knowledge, based on the imposition of a different minimum sentence in a different case, did not meet that standard.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 199.466. The property owners asserted that the commission adversely affected their interests in approving the annexation without providing them ample notice and hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners land was adjacent to the annexed area, and they maintained that the annexation could adversely affect their interests. They argued that they were not properly notified of the annexation proceedings and were denied an opportunity to be heard. The commission argued that the purpose of the statute was to provide an expedited procedure for annexations. The court confirmed the commission's decision, holding that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 199.462(1) enumerated general factors that must be given some consideration before a decision was made; but, it did not articulate specific criteria that a boundary commission was bound to apply as substantive tests in reaching a decision. The court concluded that the property owners' due process arguments also failed because they had no liberty or property interest, or concomitant procedural rights, that originated in the due process clause itself. The court also noted that no due process violations were applicable under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 199.463 because it only applied to persons without participatory rights under the other provisions of the statute, and did not enlarge what the other provisions of the statute granted or withheld.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business owner and the competitor both operated gasoline service stations. After the competitor offered self-service, the business owner brought an unfair competition action against him. The trial court dismissed the action for failure to state a claim, and the business owner sought review. The court affirmed, holding that the business owner did not have a cause of action under &sect; 480.330 because the objective of the statute was safety, not the protection of the business owner's business interests. Because the business owner was not a member of the class that the statute was designed to protect, he could not bring an action under the statute. Also, the business owner was not entitled to bring a common law cause of action against the competitor because, without a statutory violation by the competitor, there was no common law cause of action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner citizens challenged the decree of the Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA) in favor of respondent county. The decree permitted respondent landowner to site a destination resort on land that was designated and zoned at that time for exclusive farm use. The citizens contended that Statewide Planning Goal 8 prohibited such a use on land with 50 or more acres of unique farm land as defined by the United States Soil Conservation Service (SCS).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county's decision to permit the landowner to site a destination resort was based upon amendments to the county's comprehensive plan and zoning map. The citizens contended that LUBA erred by not requiring the county to show that the amendments complied with Goal 8 and by permitting the county to base its determination of whether the site contained 50 acres of unique farm on SCS studies and maps that were taken after the original destination resort siting map was made. Determinations based upon such subsequent studies were permitted by the &quot;refinement clause&quot; in the county's plan. Under the county's original destination resort siting map, the land would not qualify. A subsequent SCS study and map found that the site did qualify. The citizens argued that under Goal 8, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 197.435 et seq, and county laws the original destination resort map was conclusive; the later SCS maps could not be considered. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that &sect; 197.435 et seq. did not make original plan maps the exclusive means for determining whether the &quot;50 contiguous acres&quot; siting criterion was present in particular cases. The same reasoning applied to Goal 8 compliance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed LUBA's decision. Judicial notice of an agenda and related documents prepared by the Department of Land Conservation and Development was taken at the request of the citizens.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that: (1) the statute was not unconstitutional on its face where the remote possibility that the information required by the statute would result in criminal liability was not enough to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination; (2) defendant failed to show that the reporting of her name and address to the other driver would have placed her substantially at risk of incriminating herself; thus, the statute did not violate Or.

On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in concluding that the broadcast over the police scanner was not for use by the general public. The court stated that the police had no property or privacy interest in the broadcast and the broadcast was not coded or scrambled. Therefore, the court determined that defendant had not committed any crime when she taped the radio broadcast. However, the court held that defendant violated Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 165.540(1)(c) when she taped her conversation with the police officer because she failed to give the officer notice that she was taping the conversation. The court reasoned that defendant was aware that the tape recorder was on because tape recording the police broadcast was what brought her to the location at which she was arrested.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and affirmed the conviction, holding that denial of the motion for acquittal was not error. Whether defendant forcibly brought a piece of hand-held concrete into contact with the victim's head, or forcibly brought her head into contact with a concrete sidewalk, the concrete was a &quot;dangerous weapon.&quot; Under the circumstances in which it was used, the sidewalk was readily capable of causing death or serious physical injury. The court also affirmed the six-year sentence imposed as being lawful and within the maximum allowed by statute. The court did not address defendant's argument that &sect; 161.015(1) was unconstitutionally vague because defendant did not raise the argument in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that evidence obtained during a traffic stop for speeding should have been suppressed because the traffic stop was not valid under Or.

The court also rejected defendant's argument that under the Fourth Amendment, the court should ask whether a reasonable officer would have made the stop absent an improper purpose. The court found this standard unworkable and undesirable requiring the court to decide whether an officer had noticed anything beyond the violation itself and, if so, would have made the stop on the hypothetical supposition that he had noticed something. The same reasoning applied under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, and whether the officers would have stopped defendant for speeding absent their desire to know more about the car's occupants was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

Defendant then allegedly proceeded to block the pedestrian's path. Defendant was convicted of attempting to block and interfere with a pedestrian along a public sidewalk with the intent to interfere with the pedestrian's free passage. He appealed, contending that the trial court erred in overruling his demurrer to the complaint, in denying his motion for an evidentiary hearing on his assertion of discriminatory enforcement of the ordinance, and in finding him guilty on insufficient evidence and convicting him for behavior that was constitutionally protected. The court held that the ordinance was not vague or overbroad in its scope. The court held further that the trial court did not err in finding that defendant failed to establish a prima facie case on his discrimination claim, holding that defendant failed to establish that the prosecutor had not prosecuted others similarly situated for similar conduct and that the decision to prosecute was based on impermissible grounds.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed, contending that the order to leave was unconstitutional under Or. Const. arts. I, &sect; 8 and IV, &sect; 1. The state argued that the right did not confer a right of access to private property over the objection of its owner. The court reversed, concluding that the order to leave the store's premises was not lawful and that using it as the foundation for a criminal prosecution improperly interfered with the people's right under art. IV, &sect; 1 to initiate legislation. The court reasoned that the store's premises, by reason of the owner's invitation, became a forum for assembly by the community. Notwithstanding the store's apparent policy against allowing petitioners on its property, there was no evidence that defendants' activities substantially interfered with the store's commercial activity, had a serious economic impact on the store or interfered with its reasonable investment backed expectations.</SPAN></P>

The employer based its arguments on choice of law principles and argued that it would be unconstitutional to apply the statutes extraterritorially. On appeal, the court determined that the action involved employment contracts entered into in Oregon between Oregon workers and Oregon employers. Because Idaho had no statute that corresponded to the Act and the purpose of the Act clearly included the protection of workers and the assurance of their compensation, the court held that the Act applied to the Oregon employment contracts. The court also rejected the employer's argument that Idaho rather than Oregon law should apply to the claims for unpaid wages. Finally, the court rejected the employer's contentions that the complaint failed to state ultimate facts sufficient to constitute a claim against it as the worker's &quot;employer.&quot; The court refused to affirm a dismissal on pure pleading grounds because only substantive legal reasons for dismissal were presented to the trial court and an amendment could cure the defect.</SPAN></P>

The utility district filed a motion to strike the defenses, which the trial court denied. The trial court dismissed the action. The utility district appealed and the court found that the utility district's customers were already served at favorable rates, which would improve still more if the utility district acquired the public utility's power plants. The court found that the benefit to the utility district's customers from that acquisition would be substantially outweighed by the economic detriment to the public utility and its customers, the number of which exceeded the utility district's by many times.

Appellants claimed that the statutes granted a privilege to those nonretail sellers to whom the statutes did not apply and thus violated Or. Const. art.

The court held that the distinction between retail and nonretail sellers was a distinction created by the statutory scheme that appellants sought to invalidate. Sellers were free to join whichever &quot;class&quot; they desired and, by electing to be retail sellers, subjected themselves to the applicable statutes. The Equal Protection Clause was not violated because the legislature's conclusion that customers dispensing gasoline was dangerous was rational, even if erroneous.

The Department held that the rule was valid, and on review, the court agreed. The rule did not exceed the authority granted by Or. Rev.

The rates were based on rates charged by rehabilitation organizations, so the rates were reasonable and within the agency's range of discretion. The rule and statute did not violate Or. Const. art.

The father argued that Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father was in prison serving a sentence of over 20 years for rape, sodomy, and kidnapping. The father had married the mother after the child was born. After she remarried, the mother and the husband sought to adopt the child. The circuit court found that the child's best interests required that the adoption should proceed notwithstanding the father's objections. The father argued that &sect; 109.322 was contrary to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.275, which provided that convicted felons retained all the rights of the person. He also asserted that Or. Rev.

On appeal, the court held that &sect; 109.322 did not conflict with Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the mother's cross-motion for summary judgment in the father's action to be declared the father of an artificially conceived child, determining that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.239 barred the father from obtaining parental rights. The court reversed that grant on appeal and remanded the case. The court found that the plain language of &sect; 109.239, which denied parental rights to donors whose semen was used to conceive a child, showed that it applied to the father because there was no indication of legislative intent to not apply &sect; 109.239 simply because the donor was not anonymous. The court also held that &sect; 109.239, as it applied to the father, did not violate the state constitution due to that statute's rational connection with a legislative aim of facilitating artificial insemination by unmarried women. The court further determined that &sect; 109.239, as applied to the father, would have violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment if he established that he donated his semen in reliance on an agreement to give him the rights and responsibilities of fatherhood because that would have shown that he chose to participate in his child's rearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed her conviction by the District Court, Multnomah County (Oregon) for loitering to solicit prostitution, a violation of Portland, Or., City Code &sect; 14.24.050(b). Claiming the evidence was insufficient, defendant assigned as error the trial court's denial of her motions for judgment of acquittal and arrest of judgment. She contended that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague under Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 20 and 21.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance made it unlawful to loiter near a street under circumstances, including beckoning to or attempting to stop drivers, that manifested a purpose of soliciting to commit an act of prostitution. A police officer observed defendant standing with two other women near a street corner in an area that the officer characterized as a &quot;high vice area.&quot; The officer told the women to move on, but defendant and one companion got in a pickup truck that had pulled up to the curb. Defendant argued on appeal that the evidence did not prove her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that defendant's activity, taken together with her previous admission to the officer that she was a prostitute, afforded a sufficient basis for a trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had violated the ordinance. The court stated that it had previously upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance against a void-for-vagueness federal constitutional attack. Affirming, the court concluded that the ordinance was not vague under Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 20 and 21 because a person could, with reasonable certainty, determine the specific conduct prohibited by the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A child was conceived while her parents lived together in Maine. The mother then returned to her family in Oregon and refused to respond to the objector's offers to contribute to the child's support, including a $ 200 check that was returned in an unopened letter. When the mother learned that the objector was travelling to Oregon, she filed an affidavit stating that the objector was the putative father but that he had not contributed to or tried to contribute to the child's support, and placed the child with the petitioners for adoption. The objector opposed the adoption, stating that he was still willing to care for the child and desired custody. The petitioners alleged that it was error to allow the objection to adoption because the objector was not a party entitled to notice and the evidence of attempts to support the child was insufficient. In affirming the decision, the court held that the objector was entitled to notice under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.096(1)(b) and therefore was entitled to object to the adoption proceeding pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.098(1).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 165.540(1)(c) was unconstitutional because it was overbroad and vague in violation of Or.

The court reversed the conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. The court concluded that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 165.540(1)(c) was not overbroad or vague under either the Oregon Constitution or the United States Constitution. The court reasoned that the statute was not overbroad because it did not interfere with defendant's right to gather news or his &quot;freedom of the press.&quot; The court found that the statute was not vague because it defined the offense in terms such that a person could have determined the specific conduct that would fall within its reach to a reasonable degree of certainty. The court opined, however, that by prohibiting defendant's inquiry on cross-examination regarding the victim's alleged bias, the lower court denied the jury an adequate opportunity to assess the victim's credibility, which resulted in reversible error.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the state argued that the seizure was valid under the &quot;plain view&quot; doctrine. Defendant contended that the seizure of the stereo equipment without a warrant or exigent circumstances violated U.S. Const. Art. I, &sect; 9 and the Fourth Amendment. The court reversed. The court held that, if an officer was where he has a right to be, under either a warrant or an exception to the warrant requirement, he might have seized anything that he discovered, if the requirements of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 133.585 were met. The officer did no more than what a warrant would have authorized him to do. Contrary to defendant's argument, the officer did not have to &quot;know&quot; that the property was stolen. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 135.585 required only that the officer had probable cause.

Stat. &sect; 161.295(2) (as amended 1983) applied and whether the PSRB erred in finding that she could not be adequately controlled on conditional release.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1982, petitioner was found not responsible for first degree manslaughter by reason of mental disease or defect. Upon commitment, she was diagnosed as suffering from &quot;mixed personality disorder.&quot; The 1983 amendment of &sect; 161.295(2) excluded personality disorders from the terms &quot;mental disease or defect.&quot; On appeal, the court held that, read in context, the legislature intended that, before being discharged under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.341(4)(a), a person could no longer be affected by the mental disease or defect that originally caused him or her to be placed under PSRB's jurisdiction. Petitioner had been committed because she had a mental disease or defect that made her dangerous to others. She still had that malady and was still dangerous to others. Section 161.295(2) did not require her discharge. The court also rejected her claim that that Or. Admin. R. 859-10-005(4)(b) violated the equal treatment guarantees under U.S. Const. amend.

Stat. &sect; 166.240(1) provided that any person who carried concealed upon the person any knife having a blade that projected or swung into position by force of a spring or by centrifugal force and commonly known as a switchblade knife committed a Class B misdemeanor. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.240(1) did not impinge on the constitutional right to possess a switchblade knife. A person could possess and carry a switchblade so long as it was not concealed. In light of the historical perspective, and because the legislative encroachment on the right to bear arms was reasonably related to public safety and interfered only with the manner of possession, and not possession itself, the court held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.240(1) did not violate Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 27.</SPAN></P>

After the mother left the home and the father was imprisoned for a sexual abuse conviction, the children were placed in the temporary custody of the Children's Services Division. A reunification plan was formulated, but the mother failed to comply with the plan and her parental rights were terminated. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that there was clear and convincing evidence justifying the termination of the mother's parental rights. The court noted that the mother had psychological problems, that she was reluctant to seek treatment, and that her reluctance to seek treatment interfered with her ability to care for the children. The court also noted that the mother neglected the children's medical and nutritional needs. The court concluded, in light of the fact that the mother had rejected counseling and other efforts to assist her in becoming a fit parent, that there was no realistic chance that the children could safely be returned to her. The court thus found that termination was appropriate. The court also found that the mother could not raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother asserted that the petition failed to state sufficient facts to support jurisdiction. The petition alleged that the child was within the jurisdiction of the circuit court by reason that the behavior, condition, or circumstances of the child was such as to endanger the child's own welfare and the welfare of others by reason of the following facts: (1) the child's mother used controlled substances and (2) the child's sibling had controlled substances in her system. The State asserted that a mother's use of controlled substances was a proper consideration in determined if the welfare of the child was endangered. The court reversed the circuit court's judgment. The court found that the petition must have included some factual allegation showing how the parent's drug usage endangered the welfare of the child over whom the court was asserting jurisdiction. It failed to allege that the child's welfare was endangered in any way by mother's drug use. The court reasoned that the fact that a sibling was born with drugs in her system addressed only her welfare and not that of the child in issue. Thus, the allegations were insufficient to establish jurisdiction over the child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers set up a roadblock to check vehicles coming from a private lodge where an armed robbery and shooting had occurred. When the officers stopped defendant's automobile, they discovered that he was intoxicated, and they arrested him for driving while intoxicated. Defendant filed a motion to suppress, which the trial court granted on the ground that the roadblock violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The State appealed. The court reversed and remanded for a trial, finding that defendant's right were not violated by the stop. The court found that the primary purpose of the roadblock was to apprehend the suspect of a crime, and the secondary purpose was to speak with each driver coming from the scene of the crime to determine whether any of them had witnessed the shooing or robbery. According, the roadblock in the present case clearly was designed to accomplish the broad purposes of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 181.030, which authorized the State Police to pursue and apprehend offenders and obtain legal evidence necessary to insure the conviction in the courts of offenders. The procedures in the present case did not invade the constitutional freedoms protected from government interference.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who had an extensive criminal record, was working as a police informant during several burglary investigations. The police provided defendant with a car for use in the investigation of stolen guns. The car contained a tracking device. At no time did police give defendant permission to take the car out of town, nor did they place specific limits on his use of the car. Defendant called the suspect to arrange a sale of the guns to undercover officers. The sale never occurred because defendant picked up a third person outside of town and let him drive the car, which was pulled over for speeding. Defendant was then convicted of the unauthorized use of a motor vehicle in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 164.135. On appeal, the court held that: (1) Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 164.135(1)(a) prohibited both the taking and unauthorized use of a vehicle, (2) there existed sufficient evidence to allow a jury to find that defendant did not have permission to leave town with the car, and (3) defendant's decision to drive out of town to pick up a third person not involved with the investigation allowed the police to decide that he had abandoned his role in the investigation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected school district's contention that coaches' names were exempt from disclosure under Or. Rev.

Coaches' names were not personal nor confidential, even though the information was in their personnel files. The court agreed with the trial court that the coaches' addresses were exempt personal information under Or. Rev.

He appealed, and the court, believing that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.050 governed appeals after a defendant pleaded guilty, dismissed the appeal. Following a supreme court decision that the controlling statute was actually Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.040, the court undertook consideration of the appeal on its merits. Defendant's only contention was that the challenged condition should have been more narrowly drawn to provide that he not be present in any private residence or vehicle with a female under the age of 18 without an adult present. The court disagreed, noting that defendant had a history of sexual abuse that may have involved other children and that the presence of adults had little deterrent effect on his sexual conduct in the past. The court concluded that the condition was authorized by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.540(2)(g)(C).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The distributor sold candy and household products through door-to-door sales by minors. The state promulgated regulations of such employment of minors. Appellants filed one action for a declaratory judgment that the regulations were invalid, and the state filed another action seeking injunctions requiring the distributor to comply. The trial courts entered summary judgment that the regulations were valid and issued the injunction. On consolidated appeal, the court affirmed both judgments. The court held that the minors were &quot;employees&quot; under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 653.305, whether federal or common law applied. The legislature authorized prohibiting the employment of minors under age 16 as door-to-door salespersons. The regulations did not violate free speech rights because they did not prohibit all solicitation at any time, the government had a substantial interest in the working conditions of minors, and the regulations advanced that interest. The regulations did not violate equal protection rights because the classification was not based on immutable characteristics. An exemption for newspaper carriers had a rational basis.
