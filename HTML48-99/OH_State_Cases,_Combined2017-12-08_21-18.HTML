The city solicitor declined to advise the board. The board of education sought a writ of mandamus to require the city solicitor to provide free legal services to the board of education, and to require the city officials to so order the city solicitor.

The court found that respondents relied upon dicta in their argument that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3313.35 was unconstitutional. The court noted that the cases relied upon by respondents did not support respondents' proposition that Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 19, which precluded the taking of private property for public use without compensation.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a class action brought on behalf of former state employees, entitled to benefits under either the Public Employees Retirement System or the State Teachers Retirement System, who retired prior to October 16, 1972.  On that date, R. C. 145.56 and 3307.71 were amended to provide that the right of a person to a pension or retirement allowance is subject to the state income tax.  Plaintiffs brought this action in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County seeking a declaratory judgment that the amendments to R. C. 145.56 and 3307.71 are unconstitutional, a permanent injunction to prevent the levying or collection of the tax, and a refund of taxes already collected.  The Tax Commissioner and the State Treasurer were named in the action as defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commissioner moved to dismiss the action for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, lack of jurisdiction over the person, and for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, pursuant to Civ. R. 12.  The trial court granted the motion, holding that the claim was exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Tax Commissioner by way of administrative hearing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and appeal to the courts under R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employees were state retirees who sought a declaration as to their liabilities when the law was changed to provide that their pensions were subject to state income tax. The commissioner sought dismissal of the action for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter and over the person, and for failure to state a claim pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 12. The trial court granted the commissioner's motion, holding that the employees' claims were exclusively within the jurisdiction of the commissioner by way of administrative hearing and appeal to the courts. The appellate court disagreed with the trial court. The court held that declaratory judgment was a proper means to adjudicate the rights and status of the parties when the controversy presented was a real and justiciable one. The court found that speedy relief was necessary to preserve the employees' right to refuse to pay the taxes mandated by statute. Administrative proceedings in the case would be futile because an administrative agency was without jurisdiction to determine the constitutional validity of a statute and administrative remedies would require an estimated 40,000 claimants to file separate refund applications.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 14, 1973, the Fullwell Motor Products Company purchased real estate in the Cleveland taxing district of Cuyahoga County for $ 650,000.  Based upon the sale, the Cleveland Board of Education, appellant herein, filed a complaint with the Cuyahoga County Board of Revision, pursuant to R. C. 5715.19, seeking to increase the 1973 taxable value of that property.  By letter, appellant requested that the board of revision compute the taxable value by multiplying the fair market value, stipulated to be $ 650,000, by 33.4 percent, the common level of assessment of real property in Cuyahoga County for the tax year 1970 (the year of the last complete general reappraisal of real property in that county).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 16, 1974, the board of revision found the 1973 taxable value to be $ 198,000, which was computed by multiplying the fair market value by the 1973 Cuyahoga County common level of assessment of 30.6 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board of Tax Appeals, upon appeal, finding no error in the decision of the board of revision, determined the taxable value by using the 1973 Cuyahoga County common level of assessment of 30.6 percent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant property owner challenged the order of a board of tax appeals (Ohio), which affirmed the method of appellee county board of revision in calculating the taxable value of the owner's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The issue on appeal was whether the decision of the board of tax appeals, which applied a common level of assessment to determine the taxable value of the owner's property, was unreasonable or unlawful. The owner contended that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5715.012 and 5715.19 caused statewide non-uniformity and could not be applied. The court affirmed and held that the board of tax appeals had the mandatory duty, in the exercise of its supervisory power under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5715.01 (1969), to take such steps necessary to effect an orderly correction of any inequalities in the percentage of true value at which all real property and all classes thereof were assessed for taxation. The court held that the fairest and most equitable procedure for complying with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5715.011 was to stagger statewide implementation of the board of tax appeals' uniform valuation rules over a six-year cycle beginning in the tax year 1972. The court held that the existing staggered sexennial reappraisal and the concomitant duties of the board of tax appeals during that reappraisal period were valid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an appeal from an August 17, 1973, order by the Ohio Director of Environmental Protection, acting upon a complaint filed by one Harvey A. Immerman, directing the city of Cincinnati to add fluoride to its water system as required by R. C. 6111.13.  In the case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Crotty </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> Cincinnati</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (unreported, case No. A-244304, decided July 15, 1971), a declaratory judgment action in the Common Pleas Court of Hamilton County, R.

The Attorney General of Ohio was given notice of the proceeding, but was not made a party and did not participate in the action.  The Director of Health (predecessor to the Director of Environmental Protection's enforcement responsibilities under R. C. 6111.13) was also not made a party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Contrary to an injunction issued by a court of common pleas in another action, the Director ordered the city to fluoridate its public water, as required by Ohio Rev.

The court affirmed and found that the injunction was void because the court of common pleas lacked jurisdiction to issue it. Because the Director was a necessary party to the action in which the injunction was issued, his absence from that action deprived the common pleas court of the jurisdiction to render an enforceable declaratory judgment and to enjoin the city from instituting the fluoridation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff George Primes III, appellee herein, and defendant Donald G. Tyler, appellant herein, are part of a group of weekend golfers who travel to various golf courses by way of an informal car pooling arrangement, where the golfer who arranges the tee times with the golf course also arranges who should drive as he contacts the other riders.  That determination (who drives) depends on the proximity of the selected golf course to the homes of the riders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No payment has ever been made nor has any gasoline ever been purchased by anyone for the driver.  No set arrangements regarding transportation have ever been worked out on a regular or definite basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the day of the collision, May 29, 1972, Tyler picked up Primes at his home, and, en route to the golf course, failed to complete a turn at an intersection, and collided with a telephone pole, causing injury to Primes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Primes filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas, which alleged that he was a &quot;paying passenger&quot; and that Tyler was guilty of ordinary negligence.  Tyler's answer denied both allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the plaintiff's case, the court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sustained defendant's motion for a directed verdict, and entered judgment for defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal, that judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals for Summit County (Judges Victor, Mahoney and Doyle), which found that the evidence would not support a finding that plaintiff was a &quot;paying passenger&quot; and thus the Ohio guest statute,&nbsp;R. C. 4515.02, would apply to preclude liability, but that such statute is unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection guarantees of the Ohio and United States Constitutions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant driver sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals for Summit County (Ohio), which reversed a decision of the trial court in favor of the driver in an action by appellee passenger for damages sustained in a car accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The parties were part of a group of golfers that carpooled together to various golf courses. The accident that gave rise to this action occurred while the parties were carpooling. The passenger alleged that he was a paying passenger of the driver in order to avoid Ohio's guest statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4515.02, which extended immunity to drivers for damages incurred by guests in automobile accidents. The trial court granted a directed verdict to the driver on the grounds that the passenger was a mere guest. The lower appellate court reversed on the grounds that the guest statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the decision of the lower appellate court and found that the guest statute violated the equal protection guarantees of the state and federal constitutions. The purpose of the guest statute was to prevent fraudulent lawsuits and to preserve the hospitality of the host-driver. However, the statute did nothing to prevent a guest from bringing a false claim to avoid the statute and that the availability of liability insurance made preserving hospitality moot. Thus the classification scheme created by the guest statute served no compelling governmental interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 14, 1966, plaintiff, Martha Berisford, appellant herein, and defendant, Mary Sells, appellee herein, were returning to resume classes at Ohio University in Athens following a weekend visit to their homes in Martins Ferry, when, after driving through a six-inch deep hole covered by an accumulation of water, Sells lost control of the car, which crossed the highway and plunged into a roadside ditch, causing injuries to Berisford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An informal arrangement existed among certain Martins Ferry girls attending Ohio University to ride together whenever going to or from Athens.  Appellant has contended throughout the proceeding that she had entered into an ongoing agreement to pay for her transportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berisford's amended complaint, filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Belmont County, alleged that Sells had been guilty of ordinary negligence, and that recovery should be had under the first claim which alleged an agreement to pay for the ride, or under the second claim which failed to allege payment but described herself as a &quot;passenger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant moved to dismiss the second claim for the reason that R. C. 4515.02 precluded&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  recovery under that claim in the absence of an allegation of payment for the ride or defendant's willful and wanton misconduct.  The court granted the motion to dismisss the second claim without stating reasons therefor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, plaintiff moved to reinstate the second claim, urging that the guest statute is unconstitutional, and that, therefore, her allegations stated a claim upon which relief could be granted in the absence of the statute.  The motion was summarily overruled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the court overruled motions for directed verdict, the jury returned a general verdict in favor of the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal, the Court of Appeals rejected plaintiff's contention that the guest statute is unconstitutional, ruled that plaintiff's failure to comply with Civ. R. 51 precluded an attack on alleged omissions in the court's charge to the jury and affirmed the judgment in favor of defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

One was a paying passenger of the driver. The passenger filed a negligence action against the driver, alleging that her negligence in speeding was the cause of the passenger's injuries. A jury found in favor of the driver and the passenger appealed, contending that the guest statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4515.02, that prohibited her recovery from the negligent driver was unconstitutional. The court of appeals affirmed the judgment and ruled that &sect; 4525.02 was not unconstitutional. On further appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals that affirmed the jury verdict, but found that a determination of the constitutionality of &sect; 4515.02 was not required to reach that result where the general jury verdict had not been tested by interrogatories to determine the rationale for the verdict.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September 1972, appellant, Ohio Public Interest Action Group, Inc., filed a complaint with appellee, Public Utilities Commission, pursuant to R. C. 4905.26, naming as respondents seven electric utility companies.  In its amended complaint, appellant prayed for the commission to &quot;take the following action&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. Order all respondents engaged in advertising to immediately cease all advertising and promotional practices whatsoever which directly or indirectly encourage the demand for, or the use or consumption of, electrical power in the state of Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. That in the alternative, respondents be ordered to immediately cease to include monetary expenditures for said advertising and promotional practices in the category of operating expenses in the Annual Reports filed with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio and thereby prohibiting the cost for said advertising and promotional practices from being passed on to the consumer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. That respondents refund to their consumers on a pro-rated basis all expenses incurred by the respondents and charged to the consumer for advertising and promotional activities since energy conservation was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  recognized as an issue of national concern; to wit: Earth Day, in March of 1970, the exact amount of which is not known to the complainant but will be determined by the evidence, and is approximately $ 75,000,000 (seventy-five million dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. Order respondents to adopt and implement a program whereby electrical power conservation must be considered at all levels of corporate activity including rate making, and the hiring and promotion of employees and officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. Undertake an investigation to discover any other activities of respondents which encourage the demand for, or the use or consumption of, electrical power in the state of Ohio, and issue appropriate orders to encourage conservation of electrical power and minimize environmental harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;6. Condition any further remedy or rate relief requested by respondents on maximum efforts by respondents to encourage conservation of electrical power and minimize environmental harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;7. Take any other imaginative and appropriate action to encourage respondents to conserve electrical power and minimize environmental harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;8. That claimant and the class action claimants shall have all costs, expenses and fees, including reasonable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  attorneys fees and such other and further relief as the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio shall deem just and proper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, the commission consolidated the instant cause with its own case, entitled, &quot;In the Matter of the Commission investigation of promotional activities of electric companies in Ohio,&quot; and conducted hearings on the matters raised in the complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the course of the commission proceedings, the General Assembly enacted Amended Substitute House Bill 206.  Section 9 of that Act reads:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No state agency, board, or commission shall limit or restrict the right of any public utility to engage in and promote area development or to advertise, except as otherwise expressly provided by law or by rules properly adopted in accordance with law and in effect on March 1, 1974.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 22, 1974, the commission entered in its journal the following entry in response to a motion to dismiss filed by intervenor, Ohio Association of Broadcasters:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(1) The Ohio Association of Broadcasters filed with the commission a motion to dismiss the above three cases on April 29, 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(2) The commission has previously entered entries and orders in the above matters [the consolidated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  cases] and held hearings with a view to determining the appropriateness of advertising and other promotional activities for electric and gas utilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(3) The Legislature has enacted Sub. H. B. 206, establishing the Energy Emergency Commission, which provides in Section 9:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No state agency, board, or commission shall limit or restrict the right of any public utility to engage in and promote area development or to advertise, except as otherwise expressly provided by law or by rules properly adopted in accordance with law and in effect on March 1, 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This statute, when it becomes effective, prohibits the commission from proceeding further in these matters, and therefore, they should be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(4) Although the instant cases are dismissed, Section 9 does not apply to commission determination of the reasonableness of the type of expenses under question here in rate proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Therefore, it is,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ordered, That the above-entitled matters hereby are dismissed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The public interest group filed a complaint with the Commission concerning the appropriateness of advertising and other promotional activities for electric utility companies. The Commission subsequently consolidated the complaint with its own case and subsequently dismissed the proceedings upon the motion of the broadcasters association pursuant to Amended Substitute H.B. 206, &sect; 9 (Ohio 1974). On appeal, the court affirmed the Commission's order. The court found that the proceedings under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4905.26 did not come within the exceptions enumerated in Amended Substitute H.B. 206, &sect; 9 (Ohio 1974). The court determined that the general savings clause contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.58 was not applicable because Amended Substitute H.B. 206, &sect; 9 (Ohio 1974) did not repeal Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4905.26. The court concluded that Substitute H.B. 206, &sect; 9 (Ohio 1974) did not violate constitutional provisions that prohibited retroactive legislation. The court found that Substitute H.B. 206, &sect; 9 (Ohio 1974) did not conflict with any constitutional inhibitions and that the Commission did not err in failing to consider the public interest group's request for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June 1973, appellant was tried before a jury in the Franklin County Municipal Court on a charge of petty larceny.  Judge G. W. Fais presided at the two-day trial, which terminated with a verdict of guilty.  Sentencing was continued pending a presentence investigation, and appellant was allowed to remain at liberty under bond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When appellant did not appear for sentencing on the scheduled date, Judge Fais ordered a bond forfeiture and issued a warrant for appellant's arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 23, 1974, appellant was arrested by Columbus police officers upon the basis of this warrant and three others pertaining to traffic offenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was brought before Judge Bruce Jenkins of the Franklin County Municipal Court on February 25, 1974, at the regular session of morning arraignment court.  Judge Jenkins' docket apparently listed not only the three traffic violations, but also the fact that appellant had not yet been sentenced on the petty larceny conviction.  During the course of the proceedings before Judge Jenkins, one of the traffic charges was dismissed, appellant entered a plea of no contest to the other two, was found&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  guilty and fined, and a sentence of $ 50, plus costs, was imposed for the petty larceny conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that same day, Judge Fais discovered that Judge Jenkins had sentenced appellant on the petty larceny conviction.  Judge Fais immediately vacated that sentence and ordered appellant brought before him for sentencing.  On February 27, 1974, over the objection of appellant's counsel, Judge Fais imposed a sentence for the petty larceny conviction of 60 days in the workhouse and a fine of $ 200, plus costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was incarcerated, and he promptly sought release through the present habeas corpus action initiated in the Court of Common Pleas for Franklin County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant's complaint alleges, in pertinent part: &quot;That the action of * * * [Judge] Fais setting aside the order of Judge Jenkins was without foundation in law and was and is void </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">ab initio</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, for lack of jurisdiction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Common Pleas refused to issue the writ, and that court's judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.  The cause, which allegedly involves a substantial constitutional question, is now before this court both as a matter of right and pursuant to a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

Appellant failed to show, and an arrest warrant was issued. Appellant was arrested for unrelated traffic violations, and was brought before another trial court judge. The trial court judge in the petty larceny action vacated the sentence issued in the traffic violation action, and imposed his sentence for the petty larceny offense. Appellant was incarcerated, and filed an application for habeas corpus contending that the action of the petty larceny trial judge was without foundation in law and was ab initio for lack of jurisdiction. The court of common pleas refused to issue the writ, and the refusal was affirmed by the court of appeals. Appellant sought review of the decision, and the court determined that it was proper. The court held that under the instant facts, and pursuant to the authority vested in the trial judge by Ohio R. Crim.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May 1974, the Board of Park Commissioners of the Cleveland Metropolitan Park District, appellee herein, filed applications with the Cuyahoga County Auditor, appellant herein, for real property tax exemptions for the 1974 tax year and for remission of delinquent real property taxes, penalties, and interest for two parcels of land owned by the appellee.  The remission sought for parcel No. 649-28-1A began with the 1933 tax year, for a total of $ 72,580.20.  The remission sought for parcel No. 649-28-1B began with the 1966 tax year, for a total of $ 1,579.75.  Both remission applications were based upon R. C. 5713.08 and the provisions of Amended House Bill No. 355 (effective November 21, 1973).  The auditor recommended that the exemptions and remissions in both cases be granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The applications were then filed with the Board of Tax Appeals on May 16, 1974, for its consent.  At a hearing held on July 12, 1974, before the Board of Tax Appeals, appellant contended that Amended House Bill No. 355 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 4, 1974, the Board of Tax Appeals, granted the applications, finding that the real property in question was entitled&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the tax exemptions and remissions as requested in the applications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The auditor claimed that No. 355 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed. Prior to the enactment of Ohio Rev.

Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5713.081 provided that the Board had no authority to remit more than one year's delinquent taxes. No. 355 suspended the operation of &sect; 5713.081 for a temporary period, which allowed the park board to take advantage of the law in effect and available to all other taxpayers in the same class prior to the enactment of &sect; 5713.081. As such, No. 355 was nondiscriminatory legislation, which did not violate Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2, or Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, or the Fourteenth Amendment. No. 355 did not give an advantage to delinquent taxpayers that was unavailable to other taxpayers in the same class, and was, therefore, constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants, an Ohio company and an electric company, each sought review of a ruling from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio), which affirmed the trial court's judgments dismissing appellants' application for review pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The trial court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and the court of appeals affirmed. The court affirmed, finding that Ohio Rev.

The appellate court dismissed the appeal holding that it was precluded from considering any appeal from the Board that involved the reasonableness and lawfulness of regulations promulgated by the Director. The court reversed. The fact that courts would not aid in making or revising rules of administrative officers, boards, or commissions, but would be confined to deciding whether such rules were reasonable and lawful as applied to the facts of a particular case, did not make a sweeping eradication of the protection against significant bureaucratic abuse, which was derived from judicial scrutiny of the activities of regulatory agencies. The issue of whether the rules promulgated by the Director were the result of bureaucratic abuse could not be determined on the record. Section 3745.05 required the Board to conduct a hearing de novo in an appeal from an order of the Director. The determination of that issue, and whether the denial of the hearing was not an appealable order, were issues for the appellate court to consider on remand.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 16, 1970, the Ohio Liquor Control Commission adopted, at the request of the wholesale beer distributors, a regulation designated LCc-1-73.  The stated purpose of the regulation was &quot;To Curtail the Practice of 'Special Sales,' Whether Initiated by Breweries or Wholesale Distributors.&quot; Shortly thereafter a number of breweries holding permits to manufacture and distribute beer and malt beverages in Ohio commenced court attacks upon the validity of the regulation, such court proceedings culminating in the decision of this court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Burger Brewing Co. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> Liquor Control Comm.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1973), 34 Ohio St. 2d 93.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon remand, the parties&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  reasserted their basic claims.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals held that the commission lacked authority to promulgate the rule, and, by reason of mootness, did not reach or pass upon the issue of reasonableness.</SPAN></P>

Upon further review, the court affirmed the decision and held that Ohio Rev.

The court held that it was evident that the general assembly had not specifically expressed an intention that the commission have such authority.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roland Vernell Baker, appellant herein, was arrested in the city of Kettering on October 13, 1972, at 3:20 a. m., for driving a vehicle upon a public street while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage.  Kettering Patrolman David W. H. Woolf testified that he had followed the appellant some considerable distance after first observing appellant's automobile traveling in such a manner as to straddle two lanes of eastbound traffic.  The arresting officer turned on the red light on top of his cruiser and the two blinking red lights in the grill as well as a &quot;yelper&quot; which changes tone second to second.  Appellant did not stop but continued eastbound to the intersection of Marshall and Stroop Roads where he came to a sudden, jerky stop for a red light with the police cruiser, lights and &quot;yelper&quot; fully activated, stopped behind him.  When the light changed, appellant proceeded to turn right whereupon he noted the police cruiser in pursuit and pulled over to the right curb, with the patrolman stopping again a short distance behind him.  After some fumbling, the appellant produced his driver's license, whereupon he was invited&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  out of his vehicle -- stumbling as he exited.  The patrolman testified that there was an odor of an alcoholic beverage on appellant's breath and that his speech was slurred.  At this point, Kettering Patrolman James G. Knickle arrived, and the appellant was requested to perform some manual dexterity tests consisting of the finger-to-nose and heel-to-toe exercises, neither of which he satisfactorily passed.  The testimony revealed that appellant's eyes were bloodshot and his clothing somewhat disheveled.  Thereupon he was transported to the Montgomery County Jail, where he was advised &quot;that he could, at his own expense, and on his own time, he could have the Breathalyzer test or a blood analysis taken.&quot; Appellant did not request any test.  The city of Kettering did not use or perform either of these procedures inasmuch as the Kettering Municipal Court had ruled that the Breathalyzer &quot;was not a valuable asset in determining the amount of alcoholic content in a person's blood.&quot; At the close of the city's case, which consisted of the testimony of the two policemen, a motion to dismiss or direct a not guilty verdict was made and denied upon the alleged insufficiency of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counsel&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for appellant then renewed his previous written motion to dismiss &quot;for the reason that the failure of the police department to have available and provide for him [appellant] a place or provide a test [breathalyzer or blood] for him was a denial of his constitutional rights,&quot; which motion was also denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, without presenting any evidence, rested.  The case was given to the jury which returned a verdict finding Roland Vernell Baker guilty of driving while under the influence of alcohol.  A motion for a new trial was denied.  The Court of Appeals affirmed and this court allowed a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Court of Appeals for Montgomery County (Ohio), which affirmed defendant's conviction for driving while under the influence of alcohol. Defendant argued that the charges against him should have been dismissed because the police department failed to have available and provide defendant a breathalyzer or blood test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued on appeal that the implied-consent statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191(A), provided for mandatory administration of a blood or breathalyzer test to any person arrested for operating a motor vehicle upon the public highways in Ohio while under the influence of alcohol, and that the failure to give the tests was a denial of defendant's constitutional rights. The court disagreed and noted that the implied-consent statute and the trial of a charge relating to the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol were not interdependent but rather were separate and distinct, each having its own consequences that might or might not be related. The evidence at trial showed that the police officers advised defendant that the opportunity to be tested would be provided at defendant's own expense and that defendant did not request a test. The court held that &sect; 4511.191(A) did not entitle anyone to the administration of the tests by the city or any arresting officer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 1969, appellee, Herman Holderbaum, was indicted by the Summit County Grand Jury for assault with intent to kill.  Upon a suggestion of insanity, he was referred to the Lima State Hospital for a psychiatric examination.  Subsequently, the Court of Common Pleas determined that appellee was insane and unable to stand trial, and, pursuant to R. C. 2945.38, committed him to the Lima State Hospital &quot;until * * * restored to reason.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 5, 1973, appellee was returned to the trial court as &quot;restored to reason,&quot; and able to stand trial on the indictment.  On September 23, 1973, he waived his right to trial by jury, and on October 26, the court found him not guilty by reason of insanity.  Thereafter, in accordance with R. C. 2945.39's presumption of continuing insanity, appellee was indefinitely committed to Lima State Hospital, to remain there until sane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 10, 1974, appellee filed a petition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">pro se</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the Court of Appeals for Allen County, seeking a writ of habeas corpus releasing him from Lima State Hospital.  The appellant, Superintendent of Lima State Hospital, filed a return of writ, admitting appellee was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sane and not dangerous, but requesting that his release be conditional, as provided by R. C. 2945.39.  The proposed conditions would have required appellee, for a period of one year, to obtain, and reside with, a sponsor; to report monthly in writing to the appellant; to seek and attempt to retain employment; to refrain from using alcoholic beverages or drugs without a physician's prescription; and to obtain follow-up psychiatric care at an appropriate out-patient clinic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 1, 1974, the Court of Appeals determined that appellee was sane, and for that reason entitled to an unconditional release from custody.  The court held further &quot;that so much of R. C. 2945.39 as purports to permit conditions to be placed on such release is contrary to the constitutions of the state of Ohio and the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appeal arose out of an incident occurring at The Ohio State University College of Law on May 18, 1972.  A meeting had been arranged at the college to hear speakers discuss proposed changes in the Ohio Criminal Code.  After this meeting came to order, a number of persons entered the room and began yelling and chanting, directing their remarks to Franklin County Municipal Judge G. W. Fais, a scheduled speaker at the meeting.  The record indicates that the entire group was chanting &quot;Fuck Fais.&quot; The testimony of Officer Rayburn of the Columbus Police Department indicates that the appellant was among those in the group chanting.  Officer Rayburn also testified that he saw appellant's actions and heard appellant yell at Judge Fais, calling him a &quot;goddamn pig and mother fucker.&quot; Other witnesses also identified the appellant as among the group.  Additional testimony indicated that the group held Judge Fais and indicated an intent to keep him in the room.  The record also shows that one of the law students present yelled at appellant to let Judge Fais go and then hit appellant when he refused to do so.  Judge Fais testified that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he could not identify the appellant nor did he hear appellant directly address any remarks to him.  Officer Rayburn subsequently obtained warrants for appellant's arrest.  Appellant was charged with violating three misdemeanor sections of the Ohio Revised Code (1973): R. C. 2901.25, menacing threats; R. C. 2905.301, obscene language; and R. C. 3761.11, disturbing a lawful assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was tried to a jury in the Franklin County Municipal Court on December 12, 1972.  The jury found appellant guilty of violating R. C. 2905.301, obscene language, and R. C. 3761.11, disturbing a lawful assembly, and not guilty of the charge of making menacing threats.  Judgment was entered upon the verdicts.  Whereupon, appellant perfected an appeal to the Court of Appeals for Franklin County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant based his appeal on the constitutionality of the statutes in question.  Appellant maintained that R. C. 2905.301 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, as applied, and denied him due process of law.

It also ruled that the trial court's instruction as to what constituted obscene language was merely harmless error. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that the language used by defendant was identical to language previously found not to be obscene as a matter of law. The court determined that the appellate court's affirmance on a &quot;fighting words&quot; theory not only denied defendant due process but also rendered &sect; 2905.301 overly broad and vague in its application to the language in question.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Mahoning County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants are the owners of a tract of realty in Austintown Township, Mahoning County.  The entire tract contains approximately 20.588 acres, but only a 13-acre section is involved in this appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 18, 1968, appellants' predecessor in title, Willowcrest Land Co., Inc., filed an application with the Austintown Township Zoning Commission for a rezoning of the 13-acre section from Residence R-2 to Residence R-3.  The building of multi-family dwellings is an impermissible use under Residence R-2 zoning, but a permissible use under Residence R-3 zoning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The procedure for disposing of applications for rezoning is set forth in R. C. 519.12, and this procedure was followed in this case.  First, Willowcrest's application was reviewed by the Mahoning County Planning Commission, which recommended its approval.  The Austintown Township Zoning Commission then considered the application at a public hearing; the zoning commission recommended that the application be disapproved.  Finally, the Austintown Township Board of Trustees conducted a public hearing on the proposed rezoning.  At the conclusion of this hearing, the board&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  voted to accept the zoning commission's recommendation that the application be denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 17, 1969, the corporation filed a declaratory judgment petition in the Common Pleas Court of Mahoning County, alleging that no economically feasible use of the land could be made under Residence R-2 zoning and that, therefore, the refusal of the township trustees to rezone the property amounted to a taking of property without due process of law.  The petition sought an order that the &quot;action of the [defendant] board of trustees in refusing to grant the requested zone change be declared unconstitutional, illegal and void; that the defendant zoning inspector be ordered to issue the necessary permits to plaintiff [Willowcrest] to erect apartment buildings * * * as permitted in a Residence R-3 zone * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 2, 1971, the Court of Common Pleas filed a judgment entry which gave Willowcrest the relief it sought.  This judgment was not appealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By mid-1973, appellants had secured the necessary building permits and had commenced clearing and grading operations preparatory to the construction of apartment buildings.  On June 5, 1973, appellees instituted the present litigation by filing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a complaint for injunction.  Appellees consisted of the township trustees and other individuals described in the complaint as &quot;owners and occupiers of land adjacent to and neighboring the lands hereinafter described (the 13-acre tract) * * *.&quot; The complaint alleged that use of the property was restricted by a Residence R-2 zoning classification, that the 1971 declaratory judgment action was void and of no force and effect, and that use of the land for multi-family dwellings therefore violated the township zoning ordinance.  Additionally, several of the appellees alleged that they were the owners of land for the benefit of which there existed certain restrictive covenants pertaining to a portion of appellants' property, and that the covenants would be violated if appellants were allowed to erect apartment buildings.  The complaint demanded preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting appellants from violating the zoning ordinance and the restrictive covenants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Common Pleas dismissed the complaint, ruling that the restrictive covenants were not being violated and that the doctrines of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and estoppel by judgment prevented appellees from attacking the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  validity of the 1971 declaratory judgment order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals affirmed that portion of the trial court's judgment relating to the restrictive covenants, but reversed that portion pertaining to the validity of and appellees' right to contest the declaratory judgment order.  The Court of Appeals, claiming that it was rendering &quot;the judgment which the Common Pleas Court should have rendered,&quot; enjoined appellants from using their property in any manner not permitted by Residence R-2 zoning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides have appealed to this court, and a motion to certify the record was granted.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellees, township trustees and neighboring owners and occupants, sought an injunction on appellant landowners' construction of apartment buildings. The Court of Appeals for Mahoning County (Ohio) affirmed a ruling that the restrictive covenants were not being violated, reversed a finding that a prior declaratory judgment ordering the issuance of the necessary permits to the landowners was valid, and issued the injunction. All parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court's judgment ordering the issuance of permits to allow the construction of apartments on the landowners' property after a request for rezoning was denied was not appealed. The appellate court accepted two of the arguments raised by the township trustees and neighboring owners and occupants as to why the declaratory judgment was void and subject to collateral attack but, on appeal, the court rejected all four of their reasons. The court held that the Declaratory Judgment Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. Chapter 2721, permitted actions contesting the constitutionality of township zoning ordinances and that the availability of an Ohio Rev. Code Ann. Chapter 2506 action to review the denial of a variance did not preclude such a declaratory judgment action. The court further held that the neighboring owners and occupants were not necessary parties to the declaratory judgment action because they may have had a practical interest in the outcome of the action, but they had no legal interest in the outcome. Finally, the court held that the failure to seek a variance prior to instituting the declaratory judgment action was not a jurisdictional defect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the appellate court's finding that the restrictive covenants were not violated and reversed the portion of the appellate court's judgment finding that the declaratory judgment order was invalid. The court further reversed the portion of the appellate court's judgment that restrained the landowners from constructing apartments on their property and reinstated the trial court's judgment denying injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant is an Ohio corporation, and the owner of an 8-acre parcel of real property in Eastlake, Ohio.  On May 18, 1971, appellant applied to the Eastlake Planning Commission for the rezoning of its property from industrial to multi-family, high-rise use.  The Planning Commission approved the application, and on December 28, 1971, the Eastlake City Council amended Eastlake's comprehensive zoning ordinance to permit the requested use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 6, 1972, appellant applied to the Planning Commission for parking and yard approval, a preliminary step to obtaining a construction permit.  The Planning Commission denied the permit because appellant had failed to obtain voter approval of council's amendment to the comprehensive zoning ordinance, as required by Section 3, Article VIII of the Eastlake City Charter. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That provision requires any ordinance which changes existing land use to be approved by a 55 percent vote in a city-wide election, the cost to be borne by the applicant-landowner.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;On May 18, 1971, appellant made application to the Planning Commission for rezoning.  While appellant's application was pending, initiative petitions were circulated, and a proposal requiring voter approval of all land use changes placed on the ballot.  On November 2, 1971, Section 3, Article VIII of the Eastlake charter was adopted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Subsequently, appellant's application was approved by the Planning Commission, and on December 28, 1971, city council amended the comprehensive zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">In the Court of Common Pleas, appellant contended that because Eastlake's charter was amended while appellant's application for rezoning was pending, the charter amendment did not apply to appellant.  The trial court rejected this contention, and appellant neither assigned the ruling as error nor argued it upon appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In May 1972, such an election was held, but the ordinance rezoning appellant's property failed to obtain the requisite 55 percent of the votes cast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, appellant filed a declaratory judgment action in the Court of Common Pleas, asserting that Section 3 of Article VIII was unconstitutional.  Appellant contended that the voter-approval requirement, as a prerequisite to any land use or zone change, denied appellant due process of law, and further, violated the referendum provisions of the Ohio Constitution.  Appellant also attacked the validity of the provision requiring 55 percent approval, and the provision requiring that election costs be borne by the applicant-landowner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Common Pleas upheld the validity of the voter approval and 55 percent requirements, but held the provision requiring an applicant-landowner to pay the election costs unconstitutional.  Upon appeal and cross-appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2&nbsp;Appellee did not file a cross-appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  Thus, the Eastlake charter provision requiring an applicant-landowner to bear the costs of the mandatory election is not before us.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The property owner's application for rezoning of its property for multi-family, high-rise use was approved by the city's planning commission. The city council amended the city's comprehensive zoning ordinance to permit the requested use. However, the property owner's application for parking and yard approval was denied because it failed to obtain 55 percent voter approval of the city council's amendment, as required by the city's charter. The property owner sought declaratory judgment that the charter provision was unconstitutional. The trial court upheld the provision for voter approval and the appeals court affirmed. On motion to certify the record, the court reversed and held that the property owner was denied due process. The city council, by appropriate legislative action, permitted the use of the property. However, no standards were established to insure that the referendum in which the property owner was required to obtain the consent of 55 percent of the voters would be reasonable, rational and not arbitrary. The charter provision was an unlawful delegation of legislative authority, with no assurance that the result reached thereby would be reasonable or rational.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case arose out of the arrest of the appellee, James Walter Hughes, in Green Township, Hamilton County, by an off-duty Delhi Township police officer.  The officer, at the time he observed the appellee, was aware of the existence of two outstanding misdemeanor warrants for the arrest of the appellee, and also that the Cincinnati Police Division had issued a police broadcast to arrest the defendant for &quot;investigation of grand larceny.&quot; Officer Murphy thereupon placed the appellee under arrest.  Hughes refused to submit to the arrest, and, later, the charges involved in this appeal were brought, alleging violations of R. C. 2917.33, resisting an officer, and R. C. 2901.252, assault on a law enforcement officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 30, 1973, in the Hamilton County Municipal Court, appellee's motion to quash the warrants was granted and the charges were dismissed for the reasons that the police officer made the arrest outside his jurisdiction and did not have a warrant to arrest appellee for any crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state of Ohio filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals on April 12, 1973.  That appeal was dismissed for failure of the appellant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to comply with the requirements of R. C. 2945.68.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant moved the Court of Appeals to certify the record to this court as manifesting a conflict between appellate districts on the issue of whether the state may proceed on notice of appeal alone.  The Court of Appeals denied the motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A trial court granted defendant's motion to quash the arrest warrants issued against him and dismissed the charges because the arrest was made outside of the officer's jurisdiction and without a warrant to arrest defendant for any crime. The State challenged an order of the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County (Ohio) that dismissed its appeal of the trial court's order for failure to comply with the requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.68.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State filed a notice of appeal pursuant to Ohio R. App. P. 4(B), which permitted the prosecution to appeal as of right in criminal cases. The State argued that the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.68, which required the permission of the court of appeals before a bill of exceptions could be filed, were procedural in nature and were superseded by the Ohio Rules of Appellate Procedure. The court held that the appeal was properly dismissed because Ohio R. App. P. 4(B) was in conflict with a substantive statutory provision and thus was required to yield to it pursuant to Ohio Const. art. IV, 5(B). Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2945.67 through 2945.70 created a substantive right in the prosecution to bring appeals in the instances permitted by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.70. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2945.67 through 2945.70 also limited the right of appeal by granting appellate courts discretion as to which cases will be allowed for review. Ohio R. App. P. 4(B), in providing an appeal as of right by the prosecution, enlarged the statutory right of appeal provided by the statutes and abridged the right of appellate courts to exercise their discretion in allowing such appeals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant-appellant, John H. Rogers, herein referred to as appellant, was charged in the Franklin County Municipal Court with appearing in public in the dress and attire of the opposite sex in violation of Section 2343.04 of the Columbus City Codes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, defendant assigned as error the trial court's refusal to grant his motion to dismiss.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an original action in mandamus in which the relator, Irene P. Horner, seeks a writ of mandamus directing the members of the Reclamation Board of Review to recognize her right to serve as a member of the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator was appointed a member of the board by the Governor on April 11, 1973.  The Ohio Senate took no action on the appointment of relator during the first regular session of the 110th General Assembly.  The second regular session of the 110th General Assembly began in January 1974.  On June 6, 1974, the Senate, by a roll call of 22 to 6, refused to consent to the appointment of relator, and notified the Governor of that action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator claims that the Senate vote of June 6 was a nullity and that she received consent to her appointment by action of the Ohio Constitution when the Senate failed to take any action on her appointment during the first regular session of the General Assembly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In an original mandamus proceeding, relator appointee sought an order directing respondents, members of the Ohio Reclamation Board of Review, to recognize her right to serve as a board member. The appointee contended that pursuant to Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 8 and Ohio Const. art. III, &sect; 21, her appointment was consented to as a matter of law because the Ohio Senate had not refused consent prior to the first day of its second regular session.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The appointee was designated by the governor for a position on the Ohio Reclamation Board of Review on April 11, 1973, but the Ohio Senate took no action on the appointment during the first regular session of the 110th General Assembly. The Ohio Senate subsequently refused to consent to the appointment during the second regular session of that General Assembly. The appointee claimed that the Senate's failure to act on her appointment during the first session operated as consent as a matter of law. In denying the writ, the court held that the purpose of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 8 was to establish a single continuous session divided into two &quot;regular&quot; sessions not, as the appointee claimed, to create two distinct &quot;regular sessions.&quot; Further, the court found that the applicable portions of Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 3.03, which permitted an appointment to be carried over from the first to the second regular session of the Senate, and Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 101.01, which specifically provided for a second session and termed it a &quot;continuum of the regular session, were not unconstitutional. Therefore, the court concluded that the Senate's action in refusing its consent was valid.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the budget commissions actions. The court determined that increases in valuation in the counties were the result of orders issued by the Board; therefore, the budget commissions were under a statutory duty to reduce the voted school levies. The language of &sect; 5713.11(B) was clear and unambiguous; therefore, the court could not interpret the language in the manner proposed by the boards of education.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;R. C. 4123.59 provides, in part:</SPAN></P>

He died several years later and his widow filed a claim for death benefits under the Act, asserting that his death was the direct result of the injury. The Administrator of the Ohio Bureau of Workmen's Compensation denied the claim, ruling that the jurisdictional prerequisites of &sect; 4123.59 were not met; the former employee did not die within three years of injury, did not receive disability benefits, and was not entitled to receive them, the year before death. The county court affirmed the decision, but the appeals court reversed. On review, the court affirmed the judgment, finding that the prerequisites violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Ohio and United States Constitutions. The prerequisites classified heirs into two groups, those who met the prerequisites and those who did not. Because some members of the excluded group might have proven a causal connection between an injury and the death, the prerequisites obstructed the objectives of &sect; 4123.59 and Ohio Const. art.

No appeal as of right was taken within the 30-day period after entry of judgment, although appellant did write letters to his court-appointed counsel and to the Court of Appeals concerning a possible appeal.  On July 24, 1973, appellant filed a petition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">pro se</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the Court of Common Pleas to set aside his sentence under Ohio statutory provisions for postconviction determination of constitutional rights.  Appellant stated two grounds for relief: First, that there was insufficient evidence to warrant conviction; second, that he did not have effective assistance of counsel at his trial.  The petition was dismissed without a hearing and without a filing of findings of fact and conclusions of law.  The journal entry stated, as a basis for dismissal, that appellant &quot;never appealed his judgment of conviction nor attempted to exercise further appellate remedies available to him.&quot; A motion for appointment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of counsel was also denied.</SPAN></P>

Pennsylvania had little interest in having her law applied. Both decedents were residents of Ohio, the aircraft was owned by an Ohio corporation and was hangared there, and the administration of the estates of the deceased Ohio residents was a direct concern of that state.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September 1971, appellee Board of Commissioners of Hardin County entered into a lease-purchase contract for 46 voting machines.  Voting machines were used in the November 1971 general election and the May 1972 primary election.  In the latter election, the issue of the use of voting machines was placed on the ballot, and 68 percent of the voters approved their continued use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 6, 1972, appellants instituted the present litigation by filing a taxpayers' suit in the Court of Common Pleas of Hardin County.

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Appellants also allege in their complaint that the use of voting machines conflicted with the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions because &quot;many elderly and less sophisticated voters are so confused by such machines that they either refuse to participate in elections, or cannot operate the machines in accordance with their wills and intentions within the five-minute period allowed by law to a voter to use the machine, and such electors are deprived of their elective franchise by requiring them to attempt to use such complicated and confusing machinery.&quot; However, this allegation was not presented to this court either by brief or in oral argument, and thus we express no opinion on its merits.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In plain words, the principal thrust of this case is a claim by the appellants that the use of voting machines is absolutely unconstitutional and a request by the appellants that the use of voting machines be permanently enjoined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 26, 1972, the Secretary of State's motion to intervene as a party defendant was granted by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pleadings and the evidence adduced at the hearing held on July 28, 1972, established the following facts: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A single voting machine is totally unable to rotate names of candidates for an office; once an arrangement of names is locked into a machine, the position of each candidate in the group of candidates for an office will remain the same for every voter using that machine</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  However, in general elections conducted prior to this suit some rotation was achieved under the provisions of R. C. 3507.07 which required that in those localities utilizing voting machines the names of all candidates for each office must be rotated from precinct to precinct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time this lawsuit commenced, Hardin County was divided into 33 precincts.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The number of votes cast in each precinct varied significantly: in the November 1971 general election,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> the least number of votes cast in a precinct was 122; the largest 564</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  Each precinct was allotted one, two or three voting machines, depending on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">the number of electors expected to vote in the precinct, based upon past experience</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  Pursuant to R. C. 3507.07, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">all machines in any multi-machine precinct displayed the names of candidates for each office in the same arrangement; there was no rotation by machine within a precinct</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The procedure followed by Hardin County to program its voting machines was described by the director of the Board of Elections of Hardin County.  The board prepared two lists for the printer.  The first was a list of candidates, positioned alphabetically under the titles of the various offices.  The second was a list of all precincts in the county.  The precinct list was divided into the several political subdivisions within the county, and under each political subdivision was a listing, in regular serial sequence, of all the precincts in that political subdivision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon receipt of the two lists, the printer would determine the precinct in which he would begin the rotation.  Having selected this starting point, the printer would compose a voting machine&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ballot arrangement for that precinct by listing the candidates in the same order as shown on the candidate list.  Thereafter, the printer would compose voting machine ballot arrangements for the remaining precincts by proceeding through the precinct list, rotating the names of candidates for each office from precinct to precinct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Common Pleas, stressing that rotation of candidates' names for each voter was impossible if voting machines were utilized, not only </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">held the rotation provision of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">R. C. 3507.07</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">unconstitutional,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> but also enjoined appellees from</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> contracting or continuing to honor existing contracts for the purchase or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">use of voting machines which could not comply with the constitutional requirement for rotating names, &quot;as well as any other method of ballot formation anl alternation does</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot; (Emphasis added.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas was reversed by the Court of Appeals, which entered final judgment in favor of the appellees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause, which involves a substantial constitutional question, is now before this court both as a matter of right and pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

The court of appeals found that the rotational provision of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3507.07 was constitutional, and it refused to permanently enjoin the use of voting machines that could not achieve perfect rotation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court dismissed the taxpayers' appeal from the court of appeals' decision that the rotational provision of Ohio Rev.

Therefore, the court concluded that the constitutionality of &sect; 3507.07 was moot. The court found precinct-by-precinct rotation of candidates' names was manifestly unconstitutional under the self-executing rotational requirement of Ohio Const. art. V, &sect; 2a. The court found that machine-to-machine rotation with an even number of voting machines in each precinct assured a greater degree of rotation within reasonable limits of expense, mechanical effort, and practicality of operation. Precinct-by-precinct rotation was unconstitutional because the only permissible system was one that most closely approximated perfect rotation within reasonable limits of expense, mechanical effort, and practicality of operation. The court affirmed the court of appeals' decision, which reversed the lower court's judgment that voting machines could not comply with the self-executing rotational provision of Ohio Const. art. V, &sect; 2a.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court dismissed as moot the taxpayers' appeal from the court of appeals' holding that a state statute's rotational provision was constitutional. The court held that the board of commissioners' precinct-by-precinct rotation procedure was unconstitutional. It affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals that voting machines could comply with the self-executing rotational provision of the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The case was on remand from the United States Supreme Court, which vacated the court's judgment and remanded the cause to the court for further consideration in light of a Supreme Court decision that was decided subsequent to the publication of the court's first opinion. In the first opinion, the court had affirmed defendant's conviction for violating a city ordinance that prohibited disorderly conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant's conviction was based on speech that violated the city ordinance. The court determined that a criminal statute capable of punishing spoken words could not stand constitutional muster unless authoritatively construed by state courts to be inapplicable to speech that was protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The court found that the city ordinance was capable of punishing spoken words and, in that respect, had to be authoritatively narrowed or be held constitutionally overbroad. Thus, the court construed the city ordinance, such that persons could not be punished for speaking boisterous, rude, or insulting words, even with the intent to annoy another, unless the words by their very utterance inflicted injury or were likely to provoke the average person to an immediate retaliatory breach of the peace. The court concluded that it should adhere to its former judgment, because where epithets, used in a public place and wilfully directed at those who could hear them, were likely to provoke the average person to an immediate retaliatory breach of the peace, they were fighting words and the utterance thereof could be punished as a criminal act.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 23, 1970, the Cleveland city council enacted Ordinance No. 1842-69, which rezoned from a multi-family, general retail and semi-industry use district to a local retail business district the lands located at the northwest, northeast and southeast corners of the intersection of Superior Avenue and E. 105th Street.  On the same day, council also approved Ordinance No. 2058-68, which effected a similar zoning change on the property at the southwest corner.  The present declaratory judgment action, filed by the corporate owner of the property at the northwest corner of the intersection, challenges the validity of Ordinance No. 1842-69.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many years prior to the zoning change, the property in question, which is located in the &quot;Glenville&quot; section of Cleveland, was zoned general retail.  After enactment of the ordinance the lands abutting E. 105th Street north of the subject property retained their general retail zoning, as did the realty abutting Superior Avenue east of the Superior-105th intersection.  The remainder of the land in the vicinity was, for the most part, zoned and developed residentially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the neighborhood&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  began to deteriorate in the late 1950's, the process was dramatically accelerated by the Glenville riot which occurred in July 1968.  Several buildings in the area were burned during the disorder, and subsequently others were vandalized.  The building situated on appellee's property was damaged, and eventually the city razed it.  The property has since remained undeveloped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Development of property as a gasoline service station was permissible under the general retail zoning that applied to appellee's land prior to the 1970 change.  Such development was impermissible under local retail zoning.  Appellee's complaint alleges that it has specific plans for a service station on its property, and that the rezoning ordinance was an &quot;unconstitutional and arbitrary * * * deprivation of the plaintiff's [appellee's] property without due process of law * * *.&quot; The relief requested was not only a declaration that the ordinance was invalid, but also an award of damages to appellee for &quot;loss of use of its property.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Common Pleas granted both aspects of appellee's prayer for relief.  The ordinance was held unconstitutional and appellee was awarded damages of $ 15,600.  The court labeled&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this amount as a &quot;reasonable return&quot; upon appellee's land during the period that the rezoning ordinance was in effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals affirmed, and the cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>

In addition, the City approved Cleveland, Ohio, Ord. 2058-68, which effected a different portion of property. Subsequently, the corporate property owner filed the instant declaratory judgment action and challenged the validity of Cleveland, Ohio, Ord. 1842-69. The trial court found that Cleveland, Ohio, Ord. 1842-69 was unconstitutional and awarded the corporate property owner damages. On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed. The city thereafter sought further review, claiming that the trial court erred in finding Cleveland, Ohio, Ord. 1842-69 unconstitutional. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court found that the award of damages against the city could not stand. The court could not find any evidence to support a finding that the rezoning ordinance was a disguised attempt by the city to take the corporate property owner's land for a public purpose.

The corporation contended further that the tax was excessive in its application to oil and gas as compared to other, natural resources, and that it amounted to double taxation, which was prohibited by Ohio Const. art XII, &sect; 2. The court held that the burden of showing that Ohio Rev.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 14, 1972, defendant-appellant, Richard Gummer, and Jeffrey Gates were arrested by an Oakwood police officer and charged under Section 311.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the city of Oakwood with participating in a parade on the public streets for which no permit had been issued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon trial, the Oakwood Municipal Court found that the parade had consisted of from 30 to 70 persons, including the defendant, and had blocked vehicular traffic, to the extent of approximately two city blocks, before an Oakwood police officer forced the parade onto a side street.  The patrolman, after futile attempts to stop the parade, with requests that the parties disperse, arrested the defendant and other participants.  The court also found that application had not been made for a permit to conduct or participate in a parade or assemblage on July 14, 1972, as required by Section 311.02 of the Oakwood ordinances. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The parties also stipulated that there have been occasional other parades or processions, including high school band practices, in the city of Oakwood, where no permit was issued by the city and the participants had not been&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  arrested or prosecuted for a violation of Section 311.02 of the Oakwood ordinances.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Section 311.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the city of Oakwood, as stipulated by the parties, reads, as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;Parades and Assemblages</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;No person, group of persons or organization shall conduct or participate in any parade, procession or assemblage upon any street or highway, or block off any street or highway area, without first obtaining a permit from the city manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;Applications for such permits shall be made on such forms as may be prescribed and shall contain such information as is reasonably necessary to a fair determination of whether a permit should be issued.  Applications shall be filed not less than five days before the time intended for such parade, procession or assemblage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;The permit may be refused or cancelled if the resultant conditions would unreasonably hinder the movement of traffic or would require the diversion of sufficient police officers or firemen so as to deprive the municipality of normal police and fire protection, or would be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">reasonably likely</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14"> to provoke disorderly conduct or create a disturbance.  [Emphasis added.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;The permit or any order accompanying it may limit or prescribe reasonable conditions, including the hours, the places of assembly and of dispersal, the route of march or travel and the streets, highways or portions thereof which may be used or occupied.  In addition, the city manager may provide, as a condition for the issuance of the permit, that the person, group of persons or organization conducting the parade, procession or assemblage assume, in writing, the obligation of paying the costs to the city of supervising and directing such parade, procession or assemblage, including the cost of providing personnel from the Departments of Safety and Service, or any other city personnel, and including the costs of the services of outside contractors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The trial court found the defendant guilty on the basis that the defendant did block traffic in the city of Oakwood and &quot;that the portion of Section 311.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the city of Oakwood, Ohio, which provides: 'No person, group of persons or organization shall * * * block off any street or highway area, without first obtaining a permit from the city manager' is not unconstitutionally vague or broad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant argued in the Court of Appeals that Section 311.02 of the Oakwood ordinances resulted in a prior restraint upon appellant's rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and that the ordinance was unconstitutionally broad and vague.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Municipal Court, holding that the employment of the words &quot;reasonable,&quot; &quot;reasonably,&quot; and &quot;unreasonably&quot; did not render the ordinance vague or subject to arbitrary application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of appellant's motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed a decision of the Court of Appeals for Montgomery County (Ohio), which affirmed the judgment of a municipal court, convicting him of participating in a parade on the public streets for which no permit had been issued under Oakwood, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 311.02.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city ordinance stated that a parade permit could be refused or cancelled if the resultant conditions would be reasonably likely to provoke disorderly conduct or create a disturbance.Defendant had not applied for a permit but objected to his arrest and conviction after conducting his own parade as a birthday celebration. The court reversed, finding that the ordinance was overbroad and an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech and free assembly. The court found that defendant had standing to challenge the ordinance even though he had not applied for a permit. This was so because First Amendment issues were to be carefully scrutinized to avoid the improper application of penal statutes. The court ruled that the language of the ordinance granted overly broad discretion to the licensing authority. The city undoubtedly had the authority to police its own roads but could not rely upon such vague language as &quot;the reasonable likelihood of the parade provoking disorderly conduct or creating a disturbance.&quot; What constituted such conduct was not defined in the ordinance and its vagueness rendered it unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the judgment below, finding the ordinance under which defendant was convicted to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Common Pleas held that the film was obscene and permanently enjoined the owners, appellants herein, from exhibiting the film.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals affirmed the finding of obscenity and held that the film's exhibition by the theater rendered the theater itself a nuisance.

On appeal, the court held that the ordinance was unconstitutionally void for vagueness because it did not provide adequate standards by which activity could have been determined as legal or illegal. The court observed that the ordinance essentially prohibited prowling in circumstances warranting a reasonable man to believe that the safety of persons or property was threatened. The court noted that the description of prowling included the terms &quot;lurking&quot; and &quot;lingering.&quot; The court ruled that based on such a description, the ordinance was void because a person merely waiting on a street corner would not have been given fair notice that such activity constituted prowling.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Lee Nelson, appellant herein, was indicted by the grand jury of Hamilton County on a single count of armed robbery on December 7, 1971.  He entered a plea of not guilty, and, on June 8, 1972, a jury was impaneled and the cause tried.  The testimony of the prosecuting witness was properly submitted to the jury by way of deposition, since he was no longer a resident of the state.  Appellant elected not to testify, and, during the course of the prosecutor's closing argument, the following statement was made:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * Mr. Perry [defense counsel] says, 'We don't have a boot.' Certainly we don't have a boot.  There is only one person in this courtroom today who knows where the boots are, and he is sitting there in the red shirt (indicating defendant seated at counsel table).  Mr. Perry [defense counsel] says that we don't have a gun.  Again, there is only one man in the courtroom who knows where the gun is, and he is sitting there in the red shirt (indicating defendant seated at counsel table).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of the court's charge, defense counsel conferred with the court, out of the hearing of the jury and off the record. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the jury left the courtroom to begin their deliberations, the following colloquy took place:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Court: Mr. Perry asked the court to charge on the question of the fact that the defendant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">had not denied by taking the stand and refuting an argument which Mr. Shea made</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in his closing argument, namely that only the defendant could tell where the gun was or the shoes were.&quot; (Emphasis added.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe I am quoting you correctly, Mr. Perry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Perry: Yes, your Honor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Court: You thought that I should instruct the jury in reference to the fact that the defendant had not taken the stand, and I specifically denied that request, saying that this court would be in error if it made any comment on the fact that defendant had not taken the stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You may have an exception to my rulings, Mr. Perry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Perry: The charge that we asked the court to give is as follows: 'It is not necessary that the defendant take the witness stand in his own defense.  In fact, he has a constitutional right not to testify.  That being the case, the fact that he did not testify must not be considered for any purpose.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Court: I feel that I would be in error to make any comment whatsoever&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with reference to the defendant not taking the stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You may have an exception to my ruling, Mr. Perry * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict of guilty.  The judgment of conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.  The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion for leave to appeal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant did not testify at trial. The prosecutor's closing argument called attention to the fact that he did not testify by commenting that defendant was the only person who knew where the gun and other items were and that he was seated at defense counsel's table. The trial court denied defense counsel's request for a jury instruction informing the jury that defendant had a constitutional right not to testify and that his failure to do so could not be considered for any purpose. In denying the request, the trial court stated that it believed that any comment by the court that referred to defendant's failure to take the stand would be erroneous. In reversing the court of appeals' judgment, the court ruled that the trial court committed prejudicial error and abused its discretion in refusing the requested instruction because it was sound in law and appropriate to the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants, Cincinnati District Council 51, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO (hereinafter Council 51), and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO (hereinafter the International), were found in contempt of the Hamilton County Common Pleas Court for violation of a permanent injunction against striking and/or picketing against the city of Cincinnati, issued by that court on January 6, 1970.  The strike was found by the Common Pleas Court to have lasted from January 4, 1970, through February 9, 1970.  On September 14, 1971, the Common Pleas Court entered judgment finding appellants in contempt of court and fining them $ 37,000, $ 1,000 for each day of the strike.  After crediting against this fine $ 7,800 (forfeiture of a security bond), $ 2,400 (fines previously paid by individuals), and $ 1,000 (court costs), the balance of the fine was determined to be $ 25,800.  Of this $ 25,800 balance $ 13,000 was awarded to the city of Cincinnati as damages, and the remainder was awarded to Hamilton County as a &quot;criminal penalty.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant unions sought review of a judgment entered by the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County (Ohio), which affirmed the judgment of the trial court that found the unions in contempt of a permanent injunction against striking or picketing against the city, a plaintiff in the underlying action but not a party to the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After the city expressed an intent to dismiss the contempt proceeding against the unions, appellee taxpayer intervened pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 733.581. The taxpayer asserted that the city's position failed to protect the interests of the people and that the city had suffered substantial damage as the result of the unions' strike. On appeal, the court held that it was not an abuse of discretion to permit the taxpayer to intervene because the underlying litigation was a matter of great public interest. The court further held that the contempt judgment was appropriate and supported by the evidence, except to the extent that it fined the unions for acts occurring prior to the date that the permanent injunction was issued. The court reasoned that the show cause order spoke only to the permanent injunction. Therefore it was improper to fine the unions for violations of an earlier restraining order. Otherwise, the court concluded that the award of damages was lawful and constitutional. The city's decision not to prosecute for contempt did not constitute a waiver of the taxpayer's right to proceed with the action under &sect; 733.581.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the lower appellate court's judgment in part and reversed it in part.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator, Charles Brockman, was charged in the mayor's court of the city of Blue Ash with certain violations of the traffic ordinances of that city.  He appeared in the mayor's court and, as he alleges in his complaint, objected to the proceedings &quot;* * * on the basis that the mayor's court did not have jurisdiction of the person or subject matter and * * * that he would be denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial judicial officer as guaranteed by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment should he be compelled to stand trial for traffic offenses before the mayor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor's court overruled relator's objections.  Relator then filed this prohibition action in the Supreme Court, praying for the issuance of a writ ordering respondent, Charles Proctor, mayor of the city of Blue Ash, &quot;to exercise no further jurisdiction in the matter&quot; of the traffic offenses with which relator is charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stipulation of facts filed in this cause states, in pertinent part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. The budget and city revenues [of the city of Blue Ash] include monies derived from the fines and costs in the mayor's court which constitutes a contribution to the general operating fund&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the city not in excess of ten (10%) per cent of that revenue.  The council receives financial reports from the manager each month and alterations in the budget are subject to approval by council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. The mayor of the city of Blue Ash, Ohio is elected by the council members from among their own number and the mayor serves a term of two (2) years.  The mayor is paid the sum of $ 400 per year in addition to his salary as a council member.  The mayor presides at all council meetings and votes on all issues before council.  The mayor does not have an additional vote in case of tie but is limited to his one vote as council member.  The mayor may call special meetings of council and may fill the vacancy on council if the council fails to act within sixty (60) days.  The mayor also exercises powers, rights and duties as official head of the city for all ceremonial purposes and is recognized as the official head of the city by the Governor for military purposes and by the court for purposes of serving civil process.  The mayor also performs all other duties imposed on him by any measure of council and the city charter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;6. The mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for the violation of ordinances of the municipal corporation and has jurisdiction in all criminal cases causes [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] involving moving traffic violations occurring on state highways located within the boundaries of the municipal corporation, subject to the limitations of Sections 2937.08 and 2938.04 ORC.  The mayor hears the evidence in such causes, rules upon objections, decides creditability of the witnesses and determines guilt or innocence.  The mayor also exercises his discretion in the imposition of fines and sentences of incarceration and assessment of court costs.  The mayor collects the fines levied upon the defendant and each month pays the balance of his account into the general operating fund of the city of Blue Ash, Ohio.  The only other expenditures from the mayor's fund are the return of bonds which have been posted for appearances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;7. The manager for the city of Blue Ash, Ohio is appointed by the council and he is the chief executive and administrative officer of the city.  The manager is appointed for an indefinite term subject to removal as provided by the charter and is chosen on the basis of his executive and administrative qualifications.  The manager is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  responsible to the council for the proper administration of all affairs of the city and the enforcement of all its laws and ordinances and he has exclusive authority to make all appointments, suspensions, and removal of all employees in the departments and offices under his control including the heads of all departments, and offices, but subject to such restrictions as may be imposed upon such authority of the manager pursuant to the provisions of the city charter and the civil service procedures.  The manager prepares and submits to council an annual budget and an annual appropriation ordinance provided for in the charter and is responsible for the administration of them after their adoption.  He prepares and submits to council at the end of each fiscal year a complete report on the finances and the administrative activities of the city for the prior year.  The manager also prepares and submits to council each month a report showing the conditions of all appropriated funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;8. The manager manages and supervises all public works, garbage and other services, utilities and undertakings of the city.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Relator sought a writ in prohibition to order respondent, the mayor of a city, to exercise no further jurisdiction as to traffic offenses with which relator was charged in the mayor's court on the ground that the mayor's court did not have jurisdiction of the person or subject matter and that relator would be denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial judicial officer as guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Relator was charged with several traffic offenses in the mayor's court. He argued that being compelled to stand trial before the mayor, who had no executive power or duties, but who was a voting member of the city council that determined the appropriations and expenditures of revenue derived from fines, bond forfeitures, and court costs assessed by the mayor, denied him due process. The court denied him relief. Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 1 empowered the General Assembly to establish mayors' courts and vests judicial power in such courts. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1905.01 established a mayor's court in all municipal corporations not having a police court and not being the site of a municipal court. An enactment of the General Assembly was presumed to be constitutional. Controlling judicial precedent held that the mayor's relation to the finances and financial policy of the city was too remote to warrant a presumption of bias toward conviction in prosecutions before him as judge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEALS from the Board of Tax Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each of these cases arises out of a sales and/or use tax assessment made by the Tax Commissioner of the state of Ohio.  Each also involves a transaction, in the course of which there is transferred, printed or other productions or reproductions of written or graphic matter.  The relevant facts pertaining to each individual case are as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case No. 72-263, Accountant's Computer Services, Inc. (ACS), a data processing company, receives raw data in the form of punch paper tapes or adding machine tapes upon which are recorded debits and credits which constitute records of current financial transactions of a particular business enterprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, ACS, on its premises, transcribes the information from the tapes onto key punched cards, and, with the use of data processing machines, it sorts, systematically classifies and rearranges this data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Print-outs of this rearranged data are furnished to the accountant-customer of ACS and in that form are used by the customer as drafts of financial statements, books of original entry, cash receipt journals, sales journals, cash disbursement journals and general ledgers.  Historically, the function&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  above described was a part of the accounting profession.  Known as &quot;write-up work,&quot; it was performed manually by the accountant or his staff.  The print-out, now furnished by ACS, duplicates the accountant's writeup efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tax Commissioner assessed the entire charge made by ACS as a sale.  ACS appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals, arguing that the assessment was arbitrary, unreasonable, unconstitutional and not according to law in that its &quot;activities constitute a service, and said services are specifically exempt under Sect. 5739.01(B), O. R. C.&quot; The board affirmed the assessment order of the Tax Commissioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case No. 72-660, Central Data Systems, Inc. (CDS), also involves a data processing company.  CDS obtains information from its customers for analysis of business problems and the data is furnished by the customer in a continuous ongoing manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The activity of CDS is described by the board in its decision, as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'The taxpayer is engaged in the business of providing both computing and software (brains and paper) sales and services which fall into four categories: (1) Data Processing is the operator's time, machine time, and the various reports and supplies billed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  generally on a monthly basis.  (2) Key Punching is where the operator's time usually is billed at an hourly rate or 1000 card price.  In this procedure the company takes the data, paper, or document, and has it transcribed into punched cards.  (3) Systems Design and Programming primarily consists of program and system time by the hour; sometimes on a flat fee.  The company's professional workers apply thinking to the customer's present system and then write instructions to automate the systems as in the case of upgrading machines from hand bookkeeping.  (4) Contracts, which, are not involved herein, are the outside consulting division done almost always at the clients' place of business which is billed for the consultants time only by the hour where no forms are used.  Both (3) and (4) are considered software but 3 does provide certain computer printouts in addition to consultation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'* * * The testimony was uncontradicted that the appellant provided its operation on a twenty four hour day, seven day each week basis and that during the audit period appellant had 35 to 40 employees.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, the Tax Commissioner assessed the entire charge made by CDS as a sale, and the board, finding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that CDS's activities constituted a transfer of tangible personal property which was not eligible for exception under R. C. 5739.01(B) as an inconsequential transfer, affirmed the assessment in its entirety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case No. 72-860, Andrew Jergens Company (AJC) contracted with A. C. Neilsen Company, a market research organization whose function is to provide services which consist of compiling statistical data as to the movement of consumer products into and from drug stores, food stores and mass merchandiser stores; to interpret this data in order to determine marketing information as to these products on a national basis and in specific geographic areas; and to analyze, interpret and present to its customers the statistical information compiled and assist management in making marketing decisions based on this data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the audit period, AJC utilized the services of Neilsen with respect to both hand lotions and toilet soaps.  As to each of these products, it prescribed specifications for the information it wanted from Neilsen -- as to the product class, the particular brands of products within each such class, and the sizes of each such brand.  It also prescribed that the information&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was to be assembled on a nationwide basis and in accordance with specific sales territories.  These specifications were changed from time to time during the audit period as to each of the products.  The information requested by AJC included information not only as to its own products but also as to products of its competitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an integral part of the service furnished, Neilsen assigned two account executives to AJC's account, whose duty it was to analyze, interpret and present to AJC's management the information developed by Neilsen in a meaningful and useful manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again, and for the same reasons, the Board of Tax Appeals affirmed the assessment order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The causes are now before this court upon appeals from the Board of Tax Appeals.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In three consolidated cases, appellant taxpayers challenged the judgment of the Board of Tax Appeals (Ohio) which affirmed sales and/or use tax assessments made by appellee state tax commissioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee state tax commissioner assessed taxes against appellant taxpayers. The Board of Tax Appeals affirmed the assessments, holding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5739.01(B) required the imposition of a sales tax on professional, insurance, and personal service transactions that involved any transfer of &quot;printed matter.&quot; On appeal, the court held that printed matter could be the subject of an excepted inconsequential transfer under the statute and that not all sales of printed matter were subject to taxation. The court affirmed the board's judgment as to the first appellant, who took raw material from its customers, transcribed it onto key punched cards, and sorted, classified, and rearranged it because the personal service appellant provided was inconsequential to the print out sold to the customers and was therefore taxable. The court reversed the judgment as to the other two appellants, who provided analysis of business problems and compiled, interpreted, and presented marketing data on customers' products, because appellants' services were the main items contracted for, rather than the print-outs of data processing machines.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a mandamus action, orginating in the Court of Appeals, to require the Cincinnati Board of Education to comply with an order of the Ohio Board of Education.  The Cincinnati Board of Education was ordered to transfer certain territory in its district to an adjoining district, as provided by R. C. 3311.24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February 1970, appellee, and 26 other qualified electors of the Four-Mile area of Hamilton County, which is involved in the order, petitioned, under R. C. 3311.24, for the transfer of that territory from the Cincinnati School District to the Hamilton County School District and the Forest Hills Local School District.  The petition was forwarded by the appellant to the State Board of Education, with strong opposition by the Cincinnati board on the ground that the transfer request was racially motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A public hearing was held, and the state board approved the transfer on July 13, 1970.  It then denied appellant's request for reconsideration on September 14, 1970.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 15, 1970, appellant filed an action for a declaratory judgment in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Western&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Division, against the State Board of Education to determine whether the order of the state board constituted illegal gerrymandering and discriminatory practices in violation of the federal Civil Rights Act (Section 1983, Title 42, U.S. Code) and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 17, 1972, appellee filed an action in mandamus in the Court of Appeals.  Appellant filed a motion to dismiss the action on the ground, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that the federal District Court had first acquired jurisdiction of the subject matter.  That motion was overruled, and, on May 9, 1972, the court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment.  On May 12, 1972, the court issued a writ of mandamus requiring appellant to comply with the transfer ordered pursuant to R. C. 3311.24.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 3311.24 and as requested by appellee, a county elector.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The elector petitioned the state board under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3311.24 for certain territory to be transferred out of the city school district. The state board approved the transfer, and the city board filed suit in federal court for a declaratory judgment that the state board's order was illegal gerrymandering in violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and the Equal Protection Clause. The elector then filed an action in mandamus; the court of appeals overruled the city board's motion to dismiss, on the ground that the federal court first acquired jurisdiction, and issued a writ of mandamus. The court reversed. The court held that considerations of comity, orderly procedure, and judicial economy required the state court to defer to the federal court action even though the elector was not a party to that action. Federal district courts were the proper forum for school desegregation controversies. A finding by the federal court that the transfer was without racial basis and constitutional, or conversely that it was unconstitutional, would determine the whole controversy. The elector failed to show clearly a right to the writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 5, 1970, a group of citizens filed with appellee board of elections local option petitions for the purpose of having electors of Ward 5, Precincts H and J, and Ward 6, Precincts A and B, in the city of Warren, Ohio, vote in the November 1970 general election upon whether to permit the sale of beer and intoxicating liquors within the district comprised of those precincts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 28, 1970, appellants, Laura J. Stewart and Robert L. Stewart, as qualified electors, filed a written protest to the local option petitions with the appellee board on their own behalf and on behalf of various tavern owners in the area.  In a hearing on the protest, appellants presented evidence respecting the character of the district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 14, 1970, the board denied the appellants' protest and validated the petitions.  Appellants appealed to the Court of Common Pleas, which refused to enjoin the placing of the issue on the ballot, but did temporarily enjoin certification of the balloting results.  The balloting resulted in a dry vote.  Ultimately, the Court of Common Pleas affirmed the board's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals affirmed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas.  The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A group of citizens filed with appellee board of elections local option petitions to vote in the general election upon whether to permit the sale of beer and intoxicating liquors within a district. Appellants, electors and tavern owners, unsuccessfully sought to enjoin the placing of the issue on the ballot. The Court of Appeals for Trumbull County (Ohio) upheld the validation of the petitions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The tavern owners argued that the terms &quot;residence district&quot; as used in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4301.32 and &quot;residential district&quot; as used in &sect; 4305.14 limited the local option privilege to districts comprised of two or more contiguous precincts which were primarily residential in character. They also contended that the term &quot;residence district&quot; was unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous. The court upheld the decision of the court of appeals. The court rejected the tavern owners' constitutional argument because the statute itself fully defined and circumscribed the term &quot;residence district.&quot; Further, applying the presumption that a just and reasonable result was intended by the legislature, the court held that the tavern owners' interpretation of &sect; 4305.14 was not viable. To interpret that statute as requiring that more than 50 percent of the land area of each precinct be used for residential purposes would be manifestly unjust to those precincts which fell short of such an arbitrary standard. Both &sect; 4305.14 and &sect; 4301.32 intended that a portion of a municipal corporation consisting of two or more contiguous precincts should have the privilege of local option.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, the executive secretary of the Cleveland Building and Construction Trades Council, filed this action in mandamus in the Court of Appeals to compel the city of Cleveland to adopt an ordinance &quot;providing for increases in the hourly rates of all craft workers in the employ of the city of Cleveland employed on an hourly rate, effective May 1, 1971, in all of the classifications, in accordance with schedules heretofore adopted by the city of Cleveland * * *.&quot; This action was brought &quot;* * * on behalf of all skilled building and construction tradesmen employed by the defendant city of Cleveland.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant city challenged a decision of the Court of Appeals (Ohio), which granted mandamus relief to appellee trades council and ordered the city to implement the wage rate schedule provided in the agreement between two trade associations in order to raise the city's wage rates for skilled building trades laborers to the prevailing level in private industry.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In 1970, the city enacted an ordinance which established the prevailing wage rates for construction workers employed by the city, which were the same as wage rates for tradesmen similarly employed by private industry. The ordinance was based upon three-year agreements that established the prevailing wage rate for skilled building trades laborers in the area. The contracts provided for wage increases effective May 1, 1971, but the city failed to enact ordinances to raise the city's wage rates to the prevailing level in private industry. The court of appeals ordered the city to implement the wage rate schedule provided in the three-year agreement and the court affirmed. It found that the establishment of municipal wage rates based upon prevailing wages was not an unlawful delegation of legislative authority. Further, fringe benefits such as paid sick leave, greater job security, and more steady employment could not be used as an offset against the higher base wage in private industry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause arose from the dismissal, by the Court of Common Pleas of Summit County, of a complaint filed by Louise C. Coleman, plaintiff-appellant, for a divorce from her husband, Joseph E. Coleman, defendant-appellee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint alleges that plaintiff and her husband were married on January 15, 1956, at Ozone Park, New York; that four children, presently in the custody of plaintiff, are issue of the marriage; that defendant has threatened plaintiff and the children; and that defendant has been guilty of gross neglect of duty and extreme cruelty.  Plaintiff prayed for a divorce, custody of the minor children, alimony and support, and other equitable relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff alleges further that she has been a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">bona fide</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> resident of Ohio since December 1969.  The complaint was filed August 21, 1970, less than one year after plaintiff had moved to Ohio from New York.  Service of process was obtained upon defendant in New York by certified mail.  No answer or appearance was interposed by defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Temporary restraining and custody orders were issued on August 21, 1970, and this matter was heard as an uncontested case on December&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  30, 1970.  Upon questioning by the court, plaintiff admitted not having a year's residence at the time of filing as required by R. C. 3105.03.  No request for leave of court to amend the complaint having been filed, the court dismissed the case on the ground that plaintiff was not a resident of the state of Ohio for a year prior to the filing of her complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The wife filed a divorce complaint alleging that the husband had threatened her and their children and had been guilty of gross neglect of duty and extreme cruelty.

The complaint was filed less than one year after the wife had moved to Ohio and the trial court dismissed the complaint. The dismissal was affirmed by the appellate court. On appeal, the wife contended that the residency requirement violated her right to travel freely throughout the United States. The court held that the privilege of obtaining a divorce was not a basic need as divorce was a creature of state statute. The court determined that the state had a compelling interest in overseeing divorce and marriage laws and that the one-year durational residency requirement did not prevent persons wanting a divorce from moving to Ohio, however it did provide a reasonable deferral of application for divorce, thus encouraging a new examination of the marriage to see if the move itself had resolved the differences.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 2905.34. The trial court overruled defendant's motion for a new trial. The lower court affirmed defendant's conviction, and he sought further review. On review, the court rejected defendant's claim that the lower court erred in refusing to allow testimony by defense counsel that defendant sought his opinion as to whether or not the material was obscene prior to selling it. The court concluded that the risk taken by the seller of selling obscene material would not be minimized by a third party opinion. The court also rejected defendant's claim that the state failed to establish the degree of proof necessary to find the material obscene. The court found that the determination of obscenity by the finder of fact had to be based not on personal viewpoints but on contemporary community standards, and that the factfinder had to find the material without redeeming social value and appealing to a prurient interest in sex. The court noted that the evidence conflicted on those standards and concluded that the jury was properly left to weigh the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court held, first, that through the actions of the electors in enacting the amendments, the city's citizens established the substantive policy and standards governing safety personnel salaries and instructed the city council as to the manner and method of its exercise of legislative power in furtherance of that policy. Through the charter, the court said, the citizens had retained for themselves those matters specifically regulated in the charter. All other matters, the court said, were left to the city council. The court also found that the charter amendments did not delegate legislative powers to any entity outside the city's control. The court said that the amendments merely fixed a formula, which looked to wage rate surveys.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, Lewis T. Gregory, while employed by appellant General Telephone Company of Ohio, fell from one of appellant's telephone poles, sustaining both neck and lower back injuries.  The accident occurred in January 1959.  Shortly thereafter, appellee filed an application for compensation with the Bureau of Workmen's Compensation for the neck injuries.  The claim was allowed and compensation thereon was duly paid.  At that time, the lower back injury was ignored by his doctor because &quot;* * * we were so fearful of the neck area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By December 1967, however, the back injury necessitated appellee's further hospitalization.  An extruded disc in the spinal canal was discovered and a laminectomy was performed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that regard, on June 5, 1968, appellee filed an application to reactivate and modify his original claim, to include the expenses arising out of the lower back injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The application was denied at the administrative level upon the ground that the back injury was unrelated to the neck injury.  Upon appeal, the Court of Common Pleas, although finding that the back injury arose out of the 1959 accident, simultaneously with the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  neck injury, sustained appellants' motion for summary judgment for the reason that appellee's application was not filed within two years of the injury as required by R. C. 4123.84, as amended, effective December 11, 1967.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that amended R. C. 4123.84 could not be applied retroactively so as to preclude appellee's recovery.  The cause is now before this court pursuant to our allowance of appellants' motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4123.84 could not be applied retroactively so as to preclude appellee claimant's recovery for a back injury, which arose out of an accident eight years earlier for which he had been allowed compensation for neck injuries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The claimant was injured when he fell from one of his employer's telephone poles. He sustained both neck and back injuries; however, he filed an application for compensation the neck injuries alone. Eight years later, the back injury necessitated further hospitalization, and the employee filed an application to reactivate and modify his original claim to include these expenses. The trial court found that although the back injury arose out of the accident simultaneously with the neck injury, the application was not filed within two years of the injury as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.84. Section 4123.84 provided that any pending claim, in which the remedy was affected by &sect; 4123.84, was to be governed by the terms of &sect; 4123.84 requiring an application to be filed within two years of the injury. The court found that such application of &sect; 4123.84 operated to destroy an accrued substantive right, which arose by virtue of the workmen's compensation laws, and conflicted with Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 rendering it unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. After the May 2, 1972 primary election, plaintiff McIntyre duly filed his statement of receipts and expenditures with the Franklin County Board of Elections.  At a regular meeting of the said board on June 19, 1972, plaintiff McIntyre requested that he be issued a Certificate of Nomination as the Republican candidate for the 30th Ohio House District and that his name be placed on the ballot as the Republican candidate for said office.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 24, 1969, a robbery of the Cabinet-Supreme Savings &amp; Loan Association, located in Delhi Township, Hamilton County, occurred.  During the robbery, the lone woman teller and three female customers were shot and killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 28, 1969, John Leigh, defendant herein, and Watterson Johnson, a codefendant, were arrested in Arizona.  At that time, the defendant provided a statement to an FBI special agent, in which he confessed that he had fired all the shots.  He also provided a description of how the shooting occurred and what guns were used.  The following day, the defendant repeated his confession to a Cincinnati police officer.  Both statements were introduced in evidence at the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raymond Kassow, another codefendant who was arrested in Cincinnati on the day of the robbery, had led the police to three guns which met the specific descriptions provided by the defendant in his statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecutor tried the case on the theory that the defendant was &quot;the trigger man,&quot; and had shot and killed all four women by firing a .25-caliber automatic until it jammed, then firing a .22-caliber revolver until all four&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  women quit moving.  This theory corresponds to the statements provided to the police by the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, upon one of four counts of first degree murder, the defendant testified that he had been at the Cabinet-Supreme Bank on September 24th; that he met the two other persons involved in the robbery that morning; that he had gone to Delhi with them and waited for the manager of the bank to leave; and that when the manager left, they drove to the bank.  Thus, the defendant's participation in the crime is not disputed.  However, the defendant refuted his prior statements insofar as they related to his active participation in the shooting.  He stated that he remained in the car, and that Kassow did all the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the case had been submitted to the jury, defense counsel learned that expert testimony had been available to the prosecutor's office prior to this trial.  This evidence indicated that Kassow had fired more than one shot from some gun or guns on the day of the robbery.  Such evidence had not been disclosed to this defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict of guilty, without a recommendation of mercy, and judgment was entered upon the verdict.  No motion for a new&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trial was filed by the defendant, nor was a request made to have the jury advised of this additional evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon appeal as a matter of right.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an appeal as of right arising out of the conviction without a recommendation of mercy of defendant, Watterson Johnson, for one count of violation of R. C. 2901.01, the killing of Lillian Dewald while perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Grand Jury of Hamilton County, Ohio, returned a joint indictment against this defendant and codefendants Raymond Kassow and John Levi Leigh for violation of the above section.  To the indictment, the defendant entered pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity.  Subsequently, an order was made directing the trial court to hold a separate trial for each defendant, each trial to run simultaneously in order to insure that the jurors in each trial were not influenced by the events occuring in the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court also made an order for the clerk of courts to draw 75 names to serve as special jurors for the trial of the defendant.  The names of these prospective jurors were drawn from the roles of electors, pursuant to R. C. 2945.18, 2945.19, 2313.06 and 2313.08.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At commencement of the trial, defendant moved for a change of venue and for a sanity hearing, both&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of which motions were overruled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At defendant's trial, evidence was presented which showed that on September 24, 1969, at approximately 11:00 a. m., the Cabinet Supreme Savings and Loan Association, located in Delhi Township, Hamilton County, Ohio, was robbed.  During the course of the robbery a female employee, Lillian Dewald, and three female customers were shot and killed.  Mrs. Dewald was shot in the back four times with two different guns.  The three women customers were each shot in the forehead.  The husband of one of the victims who was waiting for his wife in an adjoining parking lot during the time of the robbery, saw three men walk from the building, enter an automobile, and speed away.  He then entered the building and called for his wife.  When she did not respond, he investigated, and saw piled inside a vault the bodies of his wife and three other women.  The police, after responding, put out a call for the arrest of defendant Johnson and codefendant Kassow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the date of the crime, two men had entered the Cabinet Supreme Savings and Loan Association and opened a savings account with the teller, Mrs. Dewald.  An account signature card was filled out at that time&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under the name of &quot;Watterson Johnson.&quot; Mrs. Dewald became suspicious and notified her husband who was a Cincinnati police officer.  The next day, the two men returned to complete the account card.  At this time, Mr. Dewald was in a back room with his gun drawn and he heard one of the men identify himself as Watterson Johnson.  Dewald did not personally observe the defendant.  The two men left without incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after the murder-robbery on September 24, 1969, codefendant Kassow was arrested.  Subsequently, he gave a statement to the Cincinnati police, and as a result of this statement the police went to Fairview Park, Cincinnati, Ohio, where a paper bag containing three guns was recovered.  Ballistics examination of the guns revealed that two of them had been used in the killing of the four women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the morning of September 28, 1969, Johnson and Leigh were apprehended in New Mexico by a police officer.  After their arrest, they were turned over to FBI agents at Gallup, New Mexico.  Subsequently, an FBI agent, after duly advising Johnson of his constitutional rights, obtained a statement from him in which Johnson admitted that some time prior to the robbery he and Kassow had&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  planned the robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson also admitted to Cincinnati police officers, who had gone to New Mexico to return him to Cincinnati, that on the date prior to the robbery he and Kassow had gone to the Savings and Loan Association, where Kassow had filled out an account card using Watterson Johnson's name; that a few days before the robbery-murder they procured the services of the third defendant, John Levi Leigh; and that on the morning of the robbery the three men drove to the Cabinet Supreme Savings and Loan.  Johnson stated that Kassow remained in the car, while he and Leigh entered the building.  After entering, they announced to the teller, Mrs. Dewald, that it was a holdup.  Three other women then entered the savings and loan, and all four women were ordered into the vault, whereupon Johnson stated that Leigh then started shooting the women and, when his gun jammed, Leigh grabbed Johnson's gun and continued firing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police specialist in the identification section testified that he picked up a signature card, found in the Cabinet Supreme Savings and Loan Association on the date of the robbery, and on the signature card there was found a fingerprint of defendant, Johnson.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to death. He appealed, and the appellate court affirmed the decision. He appealed again and argued that the penalty of death was cruel and unusual punishment. The court agreed that the infliction of the death penalty under the existing law of Ohio was unconstitutional. Defendant also argued that he was denied due process because all non-registered electors were systematically excluded for jury services. The court found that the underlying requirements to become a qualified elector eligible for jury selection in Ohio were not unreasonable and that all groups of society were adequately represented within the ranks of registered electors. The court held that the trial court did not err, as alleged by defendant, when it refused to inquire into his present sanity because a last minute motion was filed on the first day of trial. The court found nothing in the record to suggest that defendant was not sane. There was no evidence presented which would have shown that the trial judge abused his discretion by failing to notice that defendant was not then sane nor entitled to an examination into the question of sanity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts are not in dispute.  The North Olmsted City Council (herein City Council) determined that a need existed for the construction of a swimming pool; however, because of the constitutional tax rate limitations and the existing city indebtedness, the city could not issue bonds in an amount sufficient to provide funds for its construction. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>

<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Section 11 of Article XII of the Ohio Constitution reads:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;No bonded indebtedness of the state, or any political subdivisions thereof, shall be incurred or renewed unless, in the legislation under which such indebtedness is incurred or renewed, provision is made for levying and collecting annually by taxation an amount sufficient to pay the interest on said bonds, and to provide a sinking fund for their final redemption at maturity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As a result, the Community Recreation Company (herein Company) &quot;presented to the city a proposal for the construction * * * [by it] on property to be conveyed [to it] by the city * * * of a municipal swimming pool * * * and the leasing of such facility including the real estate on which it is to be constructed * * * to the city for a period of ten years * * * and with provision for the city to acquire complete ownership and title to the facility and real estate upon the expiration of such lease * * *.&quot; The city accepted this offer.  This method of financing was deemed necessary in order to obtain the recreational facility &quot;without the necessity of the city incurring debt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City Council then directed the mayor to execute, on behalf of the city, a deed conveying the property to the Company, and, at the same time, to execute a lease for the same property from the Company.  The deed recites that the grantor &quot;does hereby grant, bargain, sell and convey unto the grantee, its successors and assigns, but only for so long as the premises are subject to the lease * * *.  * * * To have and to hold the same to the grantee * * * but only until the termination of the lease * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>

During the term of the lease the Company waived all right of reentry or right to retake possession of the premises for default in the payment of rent, but expressly retained &quot;any available remedy in law or in equity to sue for and collect such rentals as the same become due.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon termination of the lease, or &quot;at any other time that * * * [the Company's] interest in the premises terminates pursuant to the terms of the deed * * * [the Company agrees to] deliver to the city the premises * * * and any other improvements that * * * [it] has made on the premises at no cost and * * * [they] shall become the absolute property of the city.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case No. 71-736, appellant, James John Albini, was convicted in the Franklin County Municipal Court on the charge that he &quot;did unlawfully and knowingly exhibit * * * an obscene motion picture film * * *,&quot; in violation of R. C. 2905.34 (now R. C. 2905.35).  Appellant Albini was the manager of a theater where the film was being shown when several members of the Columbus Police Department entered the theater, viewed segments of the film, arrested him and seized one copy of the film.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case No. 71-737, appellants, Dominic Suriano and Frederick Young, were also convicted in the Franklin County Municipal Court of violating the same section.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the film in question was found to be obscene by the Municipal Court.  No appeal was taken from that finding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, defendants contested the warrantless seizures of the films and the failure of the State to afford them a prior hearing on the obscenity prior to seizing the films. Noting that no United States Supreme Court decision prohibited police officers from making a unilateral determination, after viewing a film, that it was obscene and arresting the exhibitor and seizing the film, the court affirmed the convictions and held that the seizures were not violative of U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV. Further, the seizures were not made for the purpose of preventing the film's dissemination, but to preserve the film to allow for their use as evidence in proceedings to determine defendants' culpability for criminal acts. Nor was a pre-seizure adversary hearing constitutionally required because, in each defendants' case, a single copy was seized for the sole purpose of preserving the film as evidence in defendants' criminal trials and only that one particular copy could no longer be disseminated. Moreover, the seizures were also allowable as an incident to a lawful arrest in order to prevent the concealment or destruction of evidence of the crime for which the arrest was made.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 12, 1958, by Resolution No. 1858, the city of Dayton formulated a plan for the renewal of the East Dayton area of the city, an area determined to be a blighted area appropriate for urban renewal.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;R. C. 725.05 empowers a municipal corporation to issue unvoted urban renewal bonds, payable solely from revenues provided for in other sections of R. C.

C. 725.04 and 725.05 authorize the municipality to require each purchaser from it of real property in the urban renewal area to enter into an agreement, as a condition of purchase, to make semiannual urban renewal service payments, in lieu of taxes, upon the improvements made during the period of exemption.  Such payments are to be equal to the amount of real property taxes which the purchaser would have paid on the improvements had there been no exemption, and are to be paid into the urban renewal debt retirement fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To finance the project by the method provided by R. C. Chapter 725, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  city enacted Ordinance No. 23065 on August 7, 1968, to become effective on September 7, 1968.  This ordinance provided for the issuance of $ 2,500,000 in principal amount of East Dayton Urban Renewal Bonds, payable solely from urban renewal debt retirement funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 4(c) of the ordinance, in accordance with R. C. 725.09, provides that the urban renewal bonds are not an obligation of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action under R.

Among the parties defendant named therein was The Miami Conservancy District which is the appellant in this court.  The essential issue is the constitutionality of R. C. Chapter 725.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Common Pleas held R. C. Chapter 725 constitutional, in all respects but one.  The court held R. C. 725.02 to be unconstitutional for the reason that the provision therein for partial exemption of real property, &quot;when there exists no physically exempt use&quot; was violative of Section 2, Article XII of the Ohio Constitution.  The court also held that it could not determine, on the evidence before it, that there&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  would be a contractually-binding obligation on the purchaser of affected property to make the payments to the city required to support the bonds, and therefore declined to issue an order validating the bonds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee city sought to finance a plan to improve a blighted area. The issue was the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 725. The district contended that &sect; 725.02, calling for a partial exemption of property from taxation where there was no physically severable exempt use, violated the uniform taxation requirements of Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect; 2. The district argued that &sect; 2 operated as a limitation upon the power of the general assembly to authorize exemption of property from taxation, in that no exemptions could be granted to property not used for the specific purposes mentioned therein. The court held that the general assembly had plenary power to determine exemptions from taxation, limited only by the provisions of Ohio Const. art. I. Therefore, that art. XII, &sect; 2, was not a constitutional prohibition against the issuance of urban renewal bonds in accordance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 725. The district argued that the partial exemption violated Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2, known as the &quot;equal protection clause.&quot; The court found no constitutional prohibition against such partial exemption based upon value, so long as it did not otherwise violate the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case involves a personal injury action for a money judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff, Carolyn G. Howard, suffered personal injuries on or about February 24, 1967, at an airport located in Greenville, South Carolina, when she was allegedly negligently struck by the propeller of an airplane being operated by defendant, Donald L. Allen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 18, 1968, less than two years after receiving her injuries, plaintiff instituted an action against defendant for said injuries in the Court of Common Pleas, County of Spartanburg, state of South Carolina.  In that action, plaintiff attempted to obtain jurisdiction over the defendant by causing the &quot;attachment&quot; of the limits of liability and duty to defend incident to defendant's policy of liability insurance.  Defendant entered a special appearance in that action by a motion to quash service of summons and to vacate the warrant of attachment, which motion was sustained and plaintiff's complaint dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff took an appeal from such dismissal to the appropriate Court of Appeals, and finally to the Supreme Court of South Carolina.  The sole question decided on those appeals was whether&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the duty to defend and the limit of liability contained in a policy of liability insurance constituted a &quot;debt&quot; subject to attachment under South Carolina law.  The Supreme Court of South Carolina decided that issue in the negative and affirmed the action of the trial court.  The Supreme Court of South Carolina also stated that its determination was &quot;otherwise than upon the merits&quot; of the complaint.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Howard </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> Allen</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1970), 254 S. C. 455, 176 S. E. 2d 127.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initial decision of the Supreme Court of South Carolina was rendered on July 9, 1970, and its decision denying plaintiff's petition for rehearing was rendered on July 28, 1970.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 18, 1970, within a year after the final decision by the Supreme Court of South Carolina, plaintiff filed her complaint against defendant in the Common Pleas Court of Franklin County, Ohio.  That complaint was superseded by plaintiff's amended complaint, filed on October 27, 1970.  The amended complaint alleges a claim against defendant for personal injuries suffered by plaintiff on February 24, 1967; alleges that a prior action was brought in South Carolina; and alleges that such prior action failed &quot;other than on the merits&quot; in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  July of 1970.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant filed his answer to the amended complaint on November 12, 1970, asserting, among other defenses not relevant to this appeal, that plaintiff's action is barred by Ohio's two-year statute of limitation and that the Ohio savings statute,&nbsp;R. C. 2305.19, is not available to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 20, 1970, defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, supported by affidavit which, in pertinent part, simply states that the South Carolina courts did not have jurisdiction over his person.  On December 16, 1970, plaintiff filed her memorandum contra said motion, with copies of the decisions of the Supreme Court of South Carolina attached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Common Pleas Court sustained defendant's motion for summary judgment on the grounds that plaintiff's action was not commenced in Ohio within the two-year statute of limitation and that the Ohio savings statute is not applicable in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal to the Court of Appeals, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record and as an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff's complaint in South Carolina was dismissed. Within a year of the final decision in that case, plaintiff filed a personal injury suit in Ohio. The Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio) granted defendant's motion for summary judgment because the suit was not commenced within the two-year limitation period and the savings statute did not apply. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff alleged that she was struck by an airplane at an airport located in Greenville, South Carolina. Defendant was operating the airplane. Less than two years after plaintiff's injuries, she filed the South Carolina lawsuit. She unsuccessfully attempted to obtain jurisdiction over defendant by attaching the duty to defendant and liability under his insurance policy. The Supreme Court of South Carolina affirmed the dismissal of plaintiff's action and stated that its determination was otherwise than upon the merits. Plaintiff's Ohio complaint was filed within one year of the Supreme Court of South Carolina's decision and alleged that the prior action failed other than on the merits. On appeal, the court held that the Ohio saving clause, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.19, did not apply to actions commenced or attempted to be commenced in foreign states. The court stated that the two-year Ohio statute of limitation, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.10, controlled plaintiff's action. The court concluded that plaintiff's action was not commenced within the Ohio period of limitation even though her prior action was filed in the foreign jurisdiction within two years after it accrued.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff-appellee, Inter-City Foods, Inc., doing business as Bill's Diner, operates two restaurants, one located in Massillon, Ohio, and the other located in North Canton, Ohio.  On November 27, 1968, the Tax Commissioner, after conducting a test check, assessed sales taxes against the plaintiff-appellee in the amount of $ 2,659.44 for the tax period beginning July 1, 1964, and ending August 31, 1967.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From that determination, appellee, on January 8, 1969, filed a notice of appeal with the Board of Tax Appeals.  A hearing was held on June 20, 1969, and on November 19, 1969, the Board of Tax Appeals affirmed the order of the Tax Commissioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to R. C. 5717.04, appellee, on December 17, 1969, filed a notice of appeal in the Court of Appeals for Stark County, alleging:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. The final order of the Board of Tax Appeals is unreasonable, unlawful, and against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. The evidence adduced on behalf of the Tax Commissioner is so manifestly in error, and the evidence adduced by the appellant is so manifestly credible and creditable, that the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals amounts to an unconstitutional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  taking of the appellant's property.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 24, 1969, the Tax Commissioner filed a motion to dismiss appellee's appeal, asserting that the notice of appeal did not set forth errors complained of as required by R. C. 5717.04, and thereby failed to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.  The Court of Appeals overruled the motion, heard the case on its merits, and, on April 2, 1970, entered judgment for the appellee.  The judgment voided all deficiency assessments, penalties and interests for the tax period from July 1, 1964, to August 31, 1967, holding appellee is not to be further civilly liable for that tax period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tax Commissioner appealed that judgment to this court.  The motion to certify the record was allowed and we limited oral argument to the question of the validity of the notice of appeal filed in the Court of Appeals.  </SPAN></P>

The taxpayer then filed a notice of appeal in the court of appeals, which alleged that the board's final order was unreasonable, unlawful, and against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court of appeals entered judgment for the taxpayer. On appeal, the tax commissioner argued that where a taxpayer in his notice of appeal from a decision of the board of tax appeals to a court of appeals employed language so broad and general that the same language might apply in almost any case, the appellate court was not vested with jurisdiction to hear the appeal. The court affirmed the decision, holding that the notice of appeal to the court of appeals, which complained that the final order of the board was against the manifest weight of the evidence, enumerated with specificity an error that was adequate to vest jurisdiction in the court of appeals to hear the appeal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had other property belonging to the missing man and his clothing had blood on it. During questioning, defendant orally admitted that he had stabbed the missing man and hidden his body. Defendant did not seek to suppress these oral statements, but he did move to suppress on voluntariness grounds a tape-recorded statement that he made later to the prosecutor. The motion was denied and defendant was convicted. The conviction and death sentence were upheld by the appellate court and defendant appealed. In affirming, the supreme court ruled that the tape-recorded statements should not have been admitted because there was a gap in the tape at the point where defendant was being warned of his Miranda rights. The error was harmless, however, because the statements were consistent with the prior unobjected to statements and the other unchallenged evidence was so overwhelming that conviction was inevitable beyond a reasonable doubt, as was the jury's failure to recommend mercy.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, a student at Miami University residing in the Reservation Apartments in Oxford, Ohio, was arrested by Butler County deputy sheriffs on May 21, 1970, upon the charge of using obscene language directed toward police officers.  An affidavit was filed charging that he &quot;did disturb the peace and good order of the community by conducting himself in a disorderly manner by using obscene language to passing officers in the vicinity of the Reservation Apts., contrary to Section 3773.22 ORC of the state of Ohio.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The affidavit contained no allegation charging that defendant was intoxicated at such time, nor was any claim made by the prosecution that he was intoxicated.  The trial court overruled defendant's motion to dismiss, concluding that an allegation and proof of intoxication was not required for conviction under the statute, and that conviction could be had merely upon proof that the defendant conducted himself in a disorderly manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court found defendant guilty of a violation of R. C. 3773.22 and imposed a fine of $ 50 and costs.  Defendant's motion for new trial was overruled.

The court held that the trial court erred in its determination that the provision &quot;shall conduct himself in a disorderly manner,&quot; found in the statute was a separate clause, under which defendant could have been convicted without proof of intoxication. The court, by reference to the legislative history of the statute and by application of the principle that ambiguity must be resolved against the state, concluded that the provision in question was not a separate and distinct clause of the statute.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this affidavit defendant filed a motion to quash, asserting &quot;that the law * * * [R. C. 1541.09], is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority of Article 2, Section 1 of the Constitution of the state of Ohio, and for other reasons equitable in the premises.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court sustained the motion to quash on the basis, as stated in its entry, that &quot; Section 1541.09 of the Ohio Revised Code is unconstitutional and void and constitutes an unlawful delegation of legislative power to the Division of Parks and Recreation and as a result Rule NRP 5-07, made in pursuance thereof, is void and of no effect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judgment of the trial court was premised on the holding, in its opinion, that R. C. 1541.09 &quot;establishes no standards to guide the Division of Parks in enacting rules and regulations * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals reversed, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the cause is here pursuant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;The majority opinion of the Court of Appeals, in effect, concluded that R. C. 1541.09 (and thus Rule NRP 5-07) was &quot;not unconstitutional because of an unlawful delegation of legislative authority.&quot; One judge, while concurring, &quot;in all aspects of this opinion,&quot; dissented from &quot;the holding that the rule itself is constitutional&quot; and expressed the opinion that &quot;the rule as written is unreasonable in that it prohibits all swimming in the Portage Lakes except at state beaches.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed an order from the Court of Appeals for Summit County (Ohio), which reversed the judgment of a trial court that sustained defendant's motion to quash. Defendant had been charged with swimming in a nondesignated area, in violation of Ohio Div. of Parks and Recreation NRP 5-07. Defendant's motion to certify the record was allowed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After defendant was charged for swimming in a nondesignated area, he filed a motion to quash, asserting that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1541.09 was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority under Ohio Const. art. 2, &sect; 1. The trial court sustained the motion on the basis that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1541.09 was unconstitutional and void, and constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative power to the Ohio Division of Parks and Recreation. Thus, the trial court found that Ohio Div. of Parks and Recreation NRP 5-07 was void and of no effect. On appeal, the court of appeals reversed. The court affirmed and remanded the matter for further proceedings, finding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 151.09 was not unconstitutional because of an unlawful delegation of legislative authority. The state had authority to regulate swimming as well as the areas where swimming would be permitted on waters under its jurisdiction and control. Further, the court found that the state's delegation to state administrative officials of the authority to adopt and enforce regulations to implement such a declared legislative policy was not, per se, unlawful.</SPAN></P>

In substance, the complaint alleges that on February 24, 1972, relators filed with respondent Attorney General William J. Brown a petition, in several parts, for a proposed amendment to the Ohio Constitution; that on February 28, 1972, Attorney General Brown advised the relators that he had reviewed the petition and summary of the proposed amendment, had found said summary to be &quot;a fair and truthful statement of the proposed * * * constitutional amendment,&quot; and was in the process of preparing the necessary certification to file with the Secretary of State. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relators allege further that the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County has ordered the Attorney General &quot;to retain the proposed constitutional amendment and summary thereof pending (1) further order of this court, (2) order of the Supreme Court of Ohio in case No. 72-196 as so numbered in that court, but (3) in no event for more than fourteen (14) days from March 13, 1972, the date this order was announced in open court.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 1, 1968, Catherine J. Edgecomb, appellee herein, assumed the office of Clerk of the Cuyahoga Falls Municipal Court pursuant to her election to that office the preceding November.  At the time she assumed office, her salary was computed in accordance with R. C. 1901.31(C), which reads, in relevant part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * the clerk [of a Municipal Court] shall receive annual compensation in a sum equal to eighty-five per cent of the salary of a judge of such court.  * * *&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The computation of compensation paid to Municipal Court judges on January 1, 1968, was in accordance with R. C. 1901.11 and on that date fixed Municipal Court judges' salaries at &quot;seven thousand five hundred dollars per annum, plus an amount equal to three cents per capita for the first fifty thousand of the population of the territory; two cents per capita for the population of said territory of more than fifty thousand and not more than one hundred thousand; one cent per capita for the population of such territory of more than one hundred thousand and not more than three hundred thousand; and one-half cent per capita for the population of such territory of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  more than three hundred thousand * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, on June 10, 1968, six months after appellee assumed office, R. C. 1901.11 was amended and now fixes Municipal Court judges' salaries at &quot;ten thousand dollars per annum, plus an amount equal to twelve cents per capita for the first forty thousand of the population of the territory in which he resides when elected or appointed * * * [and] ten cents per capita for the population of said territory of more than forty thousand.  * * *&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of the increase in salary afforded Municipal Court judges, appellee alleges her entitlement to a similar increase in salary based upon the 85% formula of R. C. 1901.31(C), which has remained unchanged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee filed this suit in mandamus on June 23, 1970, requesting that the finance director of Cuyahoga Falls, and the county treasurer and county auditor of Summit County be ordered to pay her the appropriate increase in salary allegedly due her under R. C. Chapter 1901 and Article IV of the Ohio Constitution.  The Court of Appeals allowed the writ of mandamus, thus commanding that the salary of the Clerk of the Cuyahoga Falls Municipal Court be increased during her term of office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants, a town finance director, the county treasurer, and the county auditor, sought review of a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Summit County (Ohio), which allowed a writ of mandamus, commanding that the salary of appellee, the clerk of a municipal court, be increased during her term of office under Ohio Const. art. IV and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 1901.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The clerk argued that, despite the provision of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 20, she was entitled to a salary increase during term because: 1) her office was a &quot;provided for&quot; position under Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 6 and the prohibitions of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 20 thus did not apply; and 2) the application of the existing statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1901.31(C), required a recalculation of her salary based upon the increase allowed to municipal court judges. The court disagreed because the salary terms in &sect; 1901.31(C), although pre-set themselves, required a legislative act providing an increase in the salary of the municipal court judge to, in turn, provide an increase for the clerk. By granting an increase to municipal court judges, the legislature concomitantly made a &quot;change&quot; in the compensation of municipal court clerks to whom the provisions of &sect; 1901.31(C) were applicable which would &quot;affect&quot; the salary of such clerks. Such a change was prohibited by Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 20 from affecting the salary of any officer during his existing term. Therefore, the clerk was not entitled to the increase allowed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1901.31(C).</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court sustained a motion to make the petition definite and certain by setting &quot;forth facts in what respect the plaintiff Willoughby Hills has been damaged.&quot; Thereafter, an amended petition was filed, joining as additional parties plaintiff, James A. and Bessie Chongris and Anton J. and Mildred F. Oblak.  The amended petition alleged, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;13. Plaintiff Willoughby Hills Village has been damaged by the aforementioned activities of defendants in that said plaintiff cannot properly plan and zone for the development of that portion of its territory under the alleged jurisdiction of the Cuyahoga County Airport Zoning Board, said power and duty being imposed upon said plaintiff by virtue of the provisions of Section 713.02 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of the Revised Code of Ohio.  Additionally the activities of defendants as aforesaid are causing the property values of real property within the area alleged to be subject to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the jurisdiction of the defendants to be depressed, with a resulting loss of tax revenues to said plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;14. Defendants wrongfully contend that the real property of the individual plaintiffs is subject to the jurisdiction and regulations of Cuyahoga County Airport Zoning Board, and said plaintiffs have been caused by such contention of the defendants to suffer a diminution in the value of their said real property.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During trial, plaintiffs Oblak were voluntarily dismissed as parties.  The trial court, considering the evidence adduced at trial, found &quot;that there is no evidence to support the contention of the plaintiffs Chongris that their property has suffered an impairment of use or a diminution in value by reason of the enactment and enforcement of the Cuyahoga County Airport Zoning Regulations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to the plaintiff Willoughby Hills, the trial court found &quot;that there is no evidence of interference with the right of the village of Willoughby Hills under Article XVIII, 3, Ohio Constitution, to control development of the lands and to adopt zoning regulations within its jurisdiction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court found further that R. C. Chapter 4563 &quot;is a constitutional exercise of state&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  legislative authority and does not violate the Ohio, or the United States Constitution&quot;; that R. C. Chapter 4563 &quot;and the Cuyahoga County Airport Zoning Regulations enacted pursuant thereto, provide for regulations for the operation of public airports and for the safety and welfare of persons, both above and on the ground, and are, therefore, legitimate matters for state legislation and regulations adopted pursuant thereto&quot;; and that the regulations &quot;complement without nullifying the Village of Willoughby Hills Municipal Zoning Regulations operating within the perimeter of the Airport Hazard Area, and are constitutionally enacted and in compliance with the statutes of Ohio.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court entered judgment in favor of defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals reversed, finding &quot;that the owners of property located in the 'Airport Hazard Area' in the airspace directly above their property through which airplanes approach and leave the Cuyahoga County Airport, own at least as much space above their property as they can occupy and use&quot;; that R. C. 4563.03, &quot;which creates the power of an Airport Zoning Board to regulate and restrict land uses and the height of structures and natural growth, constitutes&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a taking of property interest without due process of law and the Cuyahoga County Airport Zoning Regulations issued pursuant thereto, are unconstitutional, being a violation of the due process clauses of the constitutions of the United States and Ohio&quot;; and that the regulations, &quot;enacted under the authority of Section 4563.03 of the Revised Code of Ohio, are not zoning regulations under the exercise of police power, but constitute the taking of private property without compensation * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Board divided the airport hazard area into zones and within such zones restricted certain land areas. The village alleged that its constitutional right to exclusively enact zoning regulations within its territorial limits was infringed, that it violated the state constitution, and that the village was damaged by the zoning regulations. The trial court found that the law was a constitutional exercise of state legislative authority and did not violate the constitution and that the regulations were legitimate matters for state legislation. On appeal, the court reversed and agreed with the trial court. The evidence did not show an impairment of use or diminution in value of the village's property. The airport zoning regulation adopted were designed to reduce airport hazards and could constitutionally be adopted as an exercise of the state's police power when they were reasonably necessary to insure the safety of aircraft in landing and taking off and the safety of persons using the area. There was no claim of frequent low flights over the village's land. The invasion of the airspace was not shown to have affected the present use or any reasonably foreseeable use of the land.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The instant case is a challenge by appellant, United Airlines, Inc. (United), against an assessment of the Ohio Airline Excise Tax levied against it under R. C. Chapter 5745.  The contested assessment was made by the Tax Commissioner in the sum of $ 75,083.72 in taxes, to which he added a penalty of $ 11,262.56 for a total of $ 86,346.28.  This is an appeal as of right from the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals dated February 5, 1971, affirming the determination of the Tax Commissioner.</SPAN></P>

On August 18, 1969, Amended House Bill No. 689 (R. C. Chapter 5745) became law.  During the third quarter of 1969, the taxable period in question, United serviced six airports in the state of Ohio under authority of three certificates of public convenience and necessity issued to United by the Civil Aeronautics Board, an agency of the federal government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant holds no certificate of public convenience and necessity from the state of Ohio, nor requires one to render the above service.  Ohio neither licenses nor regulates United in any manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to its federal certificates of public convenience and necessity, United engages in four kinds of flights over the state of Ohio.  There are flights crossing some portion of the state but not landing in Ohio; flights originating in Ohio and terminating out of state; flights originating out of state and terminating in Ohio; and flights stopping over at one or more points within the state, but incident to an out-of-state origin or destination.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The airline contested the Ohio Airline Excise Tax as a violation of interstate commerce and due process. Affirming the judgment of the Board, the court held that the local &quot;in-state&quot; activity could have been the proper subject for taxation even though it was an integral part of interstate commerce, so long as the tax did not place interstate commerce at a competitive disadvantage with local commerce. The court noted that the tax in the case at bar was equally applicable to both interstate and intrastate commerce and did not discriminate against either. Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 5745.02 fairly apportioned the tax between in-state and out-of-state activities. The tax was not considered incompatible with the United States Constitution because the tax did not condition doing business on the state on the payment of the tax. Furthermore, state regulation of the airline industry did not provide immunity from state taxation under the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

The Superintendent argued that the Act was prospective in nature and was unconstitutional retroactively because it became operative only upon the happening of an event subsequent to the effectiveness of the lower court's decree. The lower court held that the Act was constitutional and that it applied to the liquidation proceedings of the insurance company despite the company's insolvency prior to the Act's effective date. The court agreed with the lower court and held that a claim already in existence against an insurance company prior to the effective date of the Act, on September 4, 1970, was not a &quot;covered claim,&quot; as defined by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3955.01(B). The court held that the definition of &quot;covered claim&quot; was, as a matter of English grammar, in the present tense, not the past tense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed from the Court of Appeals for Huron County (Ohio), which affirmed two convictions that were initially entered by the mayor's court, then affirmed by the common pleas court. Defendant challenged the power of the common pleas court to review the judgment of the mayor's court under Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 4(B) and Ohio Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 1905.22, 1921.01, 2953.02.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was found guilty in the mayor's court of failing to comply with a lawful order of a police officer, and for refusing to produce his driver's license upon request by a police officer. He was fined on each offense. Defendant's convictions were affirmed by the court of common pleas. On a consolidated appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the judgment. Defendant contended that the common pleas court lacked jurisdiction to review the mayor's court's judgment. On a motion to certify the record, the court held that Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 1,4 did not clearly prohibit the establishment of provisions for the review of mayor's court's decisions by the courts of common pleas. The court found that the language of Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 1 was broad enough to support jurisdiction under Ohio Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 1905.22, 1921.01, 2953.02 despite the wording of Ohio Const. art IV, &sect; 4(B). Likewise, the court opined that even though the revenue produced from the mayor's court provided a substantial portion of the municipality's funds, that fact did not mean that the mayor's impartiality was so diminished thereby that he could not act in a disinterested fashion in a judicial capacity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state of Ohio, Department of Liquor Control, purchased liquor, hereinafter referred to as State Stock Items, from appellee, House of Seagram, at its place of business in New York.  Seagram delivered the liquor, at its place of business, to a common carrier designated by the state of Ohio, and it was then brought into Ohio and delivered to a state warehouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 18, 1968, appellant, Tax Commissioner, issued an assessment of a franchise tax against Seagram pursuant to R. C. 5733.05.  The franchise tax was computed by the use of a property fraction and a business done fraction as directed by R. C. 5733.05.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The property fraction was derived from a numerator composed of Seagram's Ohio property and a denominator composed of its total property.  No question is raised herein as to the accuracy of the property fraction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tax Commissioner determined the business done fraction by including within the numerator, as business done in Ohio, all sales of liquor by Seagram to the state of Ohio.  The dispute herein involves only the numerator of the business done fraction.  The denominator of this fraction includes all sales by Seagram wherever&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and to whomever made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 25, 1968, appellee applied for a reduction in its assessment, contending that its sales originated outside of Ohio and thus that none of such sales could be included in the Ohio business-done ratio fraction set forth in R. C. 5733.05.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tax Commissioner affirmed the original assessment.  Seagram then appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board reversed the Tax Commissioner's ruling in part stating that &quot;* * * State Stock Items were items delivered to the carrier for the state of Ohio, outside the state of Ohio and therefore not to be included in the business done fraction.&quot; The board affirmed the Tax Commissioner only to the extent that &quot;bailment stock&quot; sales (items owned by Seagram and held at an Ohio warehouse until needed by the Department of Liquor Control) were included in the numerator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tax Commissioner appealed from that decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, and the cause is before this court as an appeal of right.  </SPAN></P>

The commissioner included, as business done in Ohio, the taxpayer's sales to the state of Ohio. The taxpayer claimed that the sales originated outside of Ohio and were not included. The commissioner affirmed the assessment, and the Board reversed in part, stating that the liquor delivered to Ohio's carrier outside Ohio was not included. On appeal, the taxpayer claimed that where an Ohio buyer selected the carrier and took delivery outside Ohio, the sale was not done in Ohio, although the goods were ultimately received there. The court disagreed and reversed. Sales to an Ohio buyer, delivered by the seller to a carrier outside Ohio and ultimately received in Ohio was business done in Ohio and was included in the numerator of the business done fraction, regardless of which party designated the carrier.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff-appellants, desiring to erect an automatic car wash, along with gasoline pumps, on certain land in the city of Mayfield Heights, filed an application for a building permit for such construction with the building commissioner.  The commissioner refused to issue a permit, and an appeal was taken by appellants to the Board of Zoning Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A hearing was conducted by the Board of Zoning Appeals, at which appellants' counsel presented letters from adjoining property owners who did not object to the proposed use.  Counsel outlined the proposed use and presented, as a witness, one of the applicants, Vince Capello, Jr., who gave testimony on the approximate cost of the installation.  He stated that car wash customers would be given a discount on gasoline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board of Zoning Appeals upheld the decision of the building commissioner.  Appellants requested city council to override the zoning board's decision.  The matter was tabled by council, and appellants lodged an appeal in the Court of Common Pleas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to R. C. 2506.02, appellants requested that a transcript of the proceedings be prepared and submitted by the Board&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Zoning Appeals to the Court of Common Pleas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deputy city clerk thereupon submitted a transcript which contained copies of appellants' application, exhibits relative to location and description of the property, letters and minutes of the hearing before the Board of Zoning Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to appellants' statement at the hearing, the minutes read:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Robiner stated that his clients proposed to install a 'Big Barney' auto wash which is completely automatic.  No interior cleaning, -- the customer stays in the car.  The only attendant is the person who takes the money; the charge will be $ 1.00.  The gas pumps would be at the rear of the building, the nearest being 165 ft. back of the sidewalk.  The operating hours are proposed to be from 8:00 a. m. until 8:00 or 9:00 in the evening.  Mr. Robiner further stated that they will be able to store approximately 70 cars on the property because of its depth.  There would be ingress and egress from Mayfield and S.O.M. Center roads.  If this is not sufficient, they have provisions for two more lanes.  The auto wash can handle about 120 cars per hour.  Mr. Capello, Jr., stated that there would probably be a discount of some sort for the people&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  who buy gasoline to have their cars washed.  He stated that the approximate cost of the combined installation would be $ 125,000 not including the land.  Mr. Robiner stated that to deny their request would be arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, confiscatory and unconstitutional.  He requested a decision from the board as soon as possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the hearing in the Court of Common Pleas, appellants filed an affidavit in accordance with R. C. 2506.03 stating that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(A) The transcript does not contain a report of all evidence admitted or proffered by the appellant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(B) The appellant was not permitted to appear and be heard in person or by his attorney in opposition to the order appealed from:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(2) To offer and examine witnesses and present evidence in support thereof;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(3) To cross-examine witnesses purporting to refute his position, arguments and contentions;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(4) To offer evidence to refute evidence and testimony offered in opposition to his position, arguments and contentions;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(5) To proffer any such evidence into the record, if the admission thereof is denied by the officer or body appealed from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(C) The testimony&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  adduced was not given under oath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(D) The appellant was unable to present evidence by reason of a lack of the power of subpoena by the officer or body appealed from or the refusal, after request, of such officer or body to afford the appellant opportunity to use the power of subpoena when possessed by the officer or body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(E) The officer or body failed to file with the transcript, conclusions of fact supporting the order, adjudication or decision appealed from; in which case, the court shall hear the appeal upon the transcript and such additional evidence as may be introduced by any party.  At the hearing, any party may call as if on cross-examination, any witness who previously gave testimony in opposition to such party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the hearing, the Court of Common Pleas permitted appellants to present additional evidence.  Appellants then presented testimony by Vincent Capello, Jr., Robert W. Fairless, a real estate consultant, the mayor, the chairman of the planning and zoning commission and the building commissioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the hearing the Court of Common Pleas made the following journal entry:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Based upon the record of proceedings and transcript filed in this appeal, and excluding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the additional evidence produced at the time of the hearing before this court, the court finds that the determination of the Board of Zoning Appeals, based upon what evidence it had before it, is reasonable and is supported by reliable and probative evidence, and is therefore affirmed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas.  The cause is now before this court following allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elliott M. Kaufman purchased a vacant parcel of land located at the northwest corner of Harvard Avenue and East 49th Street in Newburgh Heights, a nonchartered municipal corporation.  Kaufman's application for a permit to build a gasoline service station thereon was rejected by the village building commissioner for the reason that it would have violated the municipal zoning code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Harvard Avenue frontage is zoned for retail business which would permit the service station, this zone extends less than one-third of the property depth along the East 49th Street curb line and as little as 15 feet at the west boundary.  Thus, the entire parcel is, for all practical purposes, restricted to residential uses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harvard Avenue, within the village of Newburgh Heights, is a heavily travelled four-lane highway and, excluding a municipally-owned park area, both sides of the right of way are zoned for retail or commercial uses to a depth of at least 100 feet except the corner parcel belonging to Kaufman.  The other three corners of the Harvard Avenue and East 49th Street&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  intersection are occupied by the village hall, including the police and fire departments with appropriate parking facilities, the city of Cleveland automotive repair yards, and a retail gasoline service station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An intersection traffic count prepared by the Cuyahoga County Engineer's office shows that over 20,000 vehicles have used the Harvard Avenue-East 49th Street intersection during a given 12-hour period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The adjacent property to the north of the intersection is residential and so zoned on the west side of East 49th Street.  On the opposite side is a publicly owned park including the village hall.  The street is a four-lane thoroughfare carrying southbound truck, bus and auto traffic from Willow Freeway to Harvard Avenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the building permit was requested, Kaufman's application to the village council for a change of the residential portion of the property to retail zoning had been unanimously rejected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the refusal of his building permit and without appealing to the Newburgh Heights Board of Zoning Appeals, Kaufman filed this declaratory judgment action in the Court of Common Pleas, alleging unconstitutionality of the zoning ordinance as applied to his corner location, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and sought a mandatory injunction against the building commissioner.  The Common Pleas Court held for the village, finding the zoning ordinance reasonable, valid and constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to the property in question, and that an exhaustion of administrative remedies was not a prerequisite to the declaratory judgment action in this case.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The applicant's request for a building permit was denied. Instead of seeking review by the village board of zoning appeals, the applicant filed a declaratory judgment action, alleging that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional as applied. The trial court entered judgment for the village and held that the ordinance was valid. The appellate court reversed, holding that the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to the property and that an exhaustion of administrative remedies was not a prerequisite to the declaratory judgment action. On further review, the court held that the applicant did have the right to attack the constitutionality of the ordinance without first appealing to the board of zoning appeals because the village had only delegated to its board of zoning appeals the power to review and correct an interpretation of the zoning regulations by the administrative officers charged with their enforcement. There was no such interpretation involved in the denial of the applicant's request for a permit. Therefore, because no effectual or adequate administrative remedy was available to the applicant, he was entitled to seek a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Relator investment company filed a motion with the court to require respondent board of tax appeals to show cause why it should not have been adjudged in contempt for failing to perform its statutory duty as required by a previous order to assess all real property within the state at a uniform percentage of its true value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In a prior action, the board was ordered to perform its statutory duty under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5715.24, which imposed an obligation upon it to establish a uniform statewide rule for the determination of the taxable value and assessment of real property. After the board proposed an amendment to its rules for assessing real property, the legislature amended Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5715.01, providing in part that the board's power to issue rules concerning the determination of the taxable value of real property was not to be effective for another two years. The board then took no further steps to implement the court's prior order. The company then filed an action to show cause why the board should not have been adjudged to be in contempt. On review, the court held that the legislature's amendment purporting to delay the board's action was in conflict with Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect; 2 mandating the taxation of land by uniform rule according to value. The court noted, however, that the board took steps to comply with the original order and ceased its efforts only because it thought it was powerless to proceed further.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 10, 1968, at 2:30 or 2:45 p. m., a man armed with a gun entered Pantorium Cleaners in Dayton and robbed Mrs. Rasberry, one of the employees on duty, of the money in the cash register.  She and another employee, Miss Edna Bolan, were ordered into a back room by the robber, told to disrobe, throw their clothes out and stay in the room for ten minutes.  They followed the robber's instructions, and when they came out of the back room, it was discovered that the telephone cord had been severed and that $ 10 was missing from Miss Bolan's purse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, Lewis Carter, was later indicted on two counts of armed robbery based on the above-described incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the trial, both victims identified defendant as the robber.  The state introduced evidence through testimony of Patrolman Armstrong that one hour before he was called to Pantorium Cleaners to investigate the robbery there he also investigated a robbery at the Golden Point Drive-Inn which was located approximately 15 blocks from Pantorium Cleaners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ann Collins, an employee of Golden Point, testified in the trial that on February 10, 1968, at a little after 3:00&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  p. m., while at work, she was robbed at the point of a gun and that she and Mrs. Holden, another employee, were forced into a back room, ordered to disrobe, and that the robber ripped the telephone from the wall before he fled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither of the Golden Point robbery victims made a positive in-court identification of defendant as being the robber, but both testified that they had identified defendant as the robber in a police lineup.  Both described the robber as having a scar on his face; they stated that he wore a dark trench coat and that he carried a black gun or automatic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another state's witness, Detective Beutle, testified that he took a black raincoat, or trench coat, from defendant's home after his arrest, as well as a blank-shooting automatic gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned verdicts of guilty as to the count of armed robbery of Mrs. Rasberry, and not guilty as to the count involving Miss Bolan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment and the cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion for leave to appeal.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A series of robberies were committed. Defendant was arrested for two of them. At trial, the State introduced testimony of witnesses to different robberies. The witnesses were unable to positively identify defendant, but they described him and his car. Defendant's motion to suppress the testimony was overruled. Defendant's conviction was upheld on appeal. When defendant appealed further, the court affirmed. The standard of proof for the admission of similar acts into evidence under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.59 was not proof beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had committed the similar acts. The testimony had been relevant to the issue of the robber's identity. The State had only been required to offer substantial proof that the similar robberies were committed by defendant. The State had accomplished this. Therefore, the evidence was properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1956, petitioner was convicted as an habitual criminal ( R. C. 2961.12), and no direct appeal was taken from that judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner appealed from a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio) affirming the trial court's denial of his motion to vacate a judgment convicting him as an habitual criminal, a violation of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner sought to vacate his 1956 conviction as an habitual criminal on the ground that his 1944 conviction for burglary and larceny, upon which his 1956 conviction was based, was void because he pleaded guilty without being advised of his right to an attorney and, thus, did not knowingly or intelligently waive his right to counsel. The court noted that in denying petitioner post-conviction relief with respect to his 1956 criminal conviction, the trial court made a factual determination that petitioner had not knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel with regard to his 1944 conviction but determined that the error was not reviewable in petitioner's postconviction proceeding. The court held that justice and logic required a determination of the constitutional viability of petitioner's habitual criminal conviction and that the constitutional infirmities relating to his 1944 conviction should be considered without requiring petitioner to file additional appeals or postconviction proceedings because the matter would ultimately arrive back at the court in essentially the same posture. Thus, the court reversed the court of appeals' judgment and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner, Albert Jackson, on April 13, 1970, was convicted of two charges of driving while intoxicated by the Middletown Municipal Court, was sentenced to 20 days in the Butler County Jail and fined $ 683.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the expiration of his jail sentence, Jackson was held in jail for nonpayment of the fine, credit being provided at $ 10 per day pursuant to a rule </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>*</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> adopted by the Butler County Common Pleas Court, purportedly applicable to all prisoners held in that jail.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner was convicted of driving while intoxicated. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment and fined. After the expiration of his jail sentence, petitioner was held in jail for nonpayment of the fine. He filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the appellate court asserting that the imprisonment was without legal authority in that he was indigent and totally unable to pay the fine. On review, the court reversed the appellate court's judgment that denied the writ. In so doing, the court followed precedent established by the United States Supreme Court, which held that as to indigent defendants converting a fine into a prison term was inconsistent with the equal protection clause. Therefore, the court concluded that petitioner's fine should not have been converted into a prison term while he remained indigent and without the means to pay the fine. However, the court noted that if petitioner's financial status changed, then a different result was possible. Because there was no constitutional infirmity in imprisonment of a defendant with the means to pay who refused or neglected to do so.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By a four-count indictment returned by the Grand Jury of Lake County in April 1969, defendant, appellant herein, was charged with (1) armed robbery (R. C. 2901.13), (2) stealing a motor vehicle (R. C. 4549.04[A]), (3) cutting with intent to wound (R. C. 2901.23), and (4) assault with intent to commit robbery (R. C. 2901.24). All these crimes are alleged to have been committed on April 26, 1963, and it appears that all of such offenses are connected with the alleged robbery of a filling station owned and operated by one William Balch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was apprehended in June 1963, and by affidavit was charged in the Painesville Municipal Court with armed robbery. Upon entering a plea of &quot;guilty&quot; in that court, he was bound over to the Grand Jury. A few days later, in the Common Pleas Court, he waived indictment and entered a plea of guilty to an information charging him with armed robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For reasons not clearly shown in the record, in November 1963 defendant was permitted to withdraw his plea of guilty to armed robbery, as charged &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the information, and to plead guilty to the lesser included offense of robbery. He was then sentenced to the Ohio Reformatory at Mansfield. During all of such time defendant was not represented by counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On March 3, 1969, in a postconviction proceeding, defendant's motion for vacation of sentence and for new trial was granted by the Court of Common Pleas on the ground that defendant had not been advised of his right to court-appointed counsel and that there had been no knowing and willing waiver of his right to counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order of the Common Pleas Court gave defendant the option of waiving indictment by the Grand Jury or requiring indictment. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Appellee apparently concedes that at this point of time defendant would have been permitted to again plead guilty to unarmed robbery, its brief </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">stating</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;The appellant, after his original sentence was set aside, could have plead by way of information to the charge of unarmed robbery, but as a usual tactic of the defense, perhaps he hoped to have his case dismissed by the Grand Jury in view of the fact that witnesses many times do not remember the person who committed the crime or that they may not be available to testify because they may have moved.&quot;.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defendant chose not to waive indictment. The Grand Jury, in April, 1969, returned the four-count indictment. Defendant, represented by counsel, then filed a motion in the Common Pleas Court seeking an order prohibiting the state from trying him on any charge other than unarmed robbery. The court treated the motion as a motion to quash all four counts of the indictment, overruled it as to count one (armed robbery), and sustained it as to the other three counts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, defendant also filed a motion for an order &quot;crediting him with time served in prison under the vacated sentence.&quot; While stating that &quot;defendant's request for credit against any future sentence is premature, as the mere statement of it shows,&quot; the court's opinion and journal entry also stated that &quot;credit must be ordered for prison time served upon the original sentence,&quot; and that &quot;I will order it * * *.&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state appealed to the Court of Appeals the action of the Common Pleas Court quashing the counts of the indictment charging theft of a motor vehicle, cutting with intent to wound, and assault with intent to commit robbery, and the action of the Common Pleas Court in stating that it &quot;will order&quot; a credit &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  against any future sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment quashing the three counts of the indictment and remanded the cause &quot;for proceedings under all four counts of the indictment.&quot; It further concluded that the question of credit on any future sentence did not appear to be &quot;directed to a final appealable order.&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is now before this court upon appeal pursuant to the allowance of defendant's motion for leave to appeal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In a second prosecution, defendant appealed the reversal by the Court of Appeals for Lake County (Ohio) of a judgment of the trial court that quashed counts in an indictment of stealing a motor vehicle, cutting with intent to wound, and assault with intent to commit robbery, leaving only a count for armed robbery. The court of appeals reinstated the quashed counts. In the first prosecution defendant was convicted but then granted a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged in 1969 with the instant offenses in connection with the robbery of a gas station in 1963. He was originally charged in municipal court with armed robbery in 1963. He entered a guilty plea and was bound over to the grand jury. A few days later, in common pleas court, he waived indictment and entered a plea of guilty to a charge of armed robbery. He was then permitted to withdraw that plea and to plead guilty to the lesser included offense of robbery. During all of the proceedings, defendant was not represented by counsel. In a postconviction proceeding defendant was granted a new trial. Defendant decided not to waive indictment, and when the grand jury returned the indictment at issue here, he sought to prohibit the State from trying him on any charge other than unarmed robbery. The common pleas court quashed three of the counts, but the court of appeals reversed. The court reversed again, finding that defendant's speedy trial rights had been violated by the unjustifiable delay of six years in commencing the instant prosecution. The delay was unjustified because the State had all the necessary facts to charge defendant with the three quashed counts in 1963.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, Jefferson Thomas Berry, was indicted on two counts of first degree murder for the killing of Juanita Perkins and James Arthur Hartman.  On August 6, 1968, the bodies of both victims were found in a badly decomposed state in the Beverly Apartments, located on Gilbert Avenue in Cincinnati, Ohio.  The testimony of a medical expert indicated that the approximate time of their deaths was four days prior to August 6, 1968.  Another expert witness testified that a .38 caliber weapon was used in the killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> examination, the defendant sought to have juror number 5, Marion C. Rogers, excused for cause.  This challenge was denied.  After the seating of twelve jurors, the defense and the prosecution began the alternate exercise of peremptory challenges to dismiss jurors, each using five.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecutor then stated: &quot;The state is satisfied with the jury as it is now constituted.&quot; Defendant then exercised his sixth, and final, peremptory challenge, on juror Rogers.  After overruling a defense objection, the court allowed the prosecutor to exercise his final peremptory challenge on juror number&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  6, Martha Herche, who had been seated at the time of the prosecutor's above-quoted statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, the state introduced evidence showing that, at about 10:00 p. m. on August 2, 1968, the defendant was seen by participants in a &quot;crap&quot; game being held in front of the K. T. Lounge on Gilbert Avenue, across the street from the apartment where the bodies were found.  Defendant approached and entered the game.  Two players in the game testified that they noticed a bulge under his (Berry's) shirt, and stated that it appeared to be the outline of a gun.  After an argument, Berry left the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ernest Zanders, Robert Smith and Maurice Smith, witnesses for the prosecution, testified as to the events following Berry's departure from the game.  The former two testified that after leaving the game Berry walked &quot;down the street,&quot; while Maurice Smith stated that after leaving Berry headed &quot;in the direction&quot; of the Beverly Apartments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The testimony of those three witnesses next reveals that shots (or what sounded like a cap pistol to Maurice Smith), and the sound of a woman screaming &quot;Oh, my God,&quot; were heard from the direction of the Beverly.  There was no testimony as to how much time elapsed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  between Berry's departure from the game and those sounds; but the witnesses did state that about three to five minutes thereafter, Berry appeared in the middle of Gilbert Avenue, seemingly crossing the street towards the &quot;crap&quot; game.  After asking for a ride, and being refused, Berry began walking up Gilbert Avenue towards Deerfield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State's witness Arthur Wright, a former co-worker of the defendant's, testified that prior to August 2, 1968, he had twice seen Juanita Perkins at the defendant's residence; that he had seen Berry with a .38 special gun and had tried unsuccessfully to purchase it from him.  Wright also stated that, in a conversation at work sometime in the summer before August, Berry had told him that Juanita Perkins had left him and gone with &quot;Arthur * * * a cab driver&quot;; that Berry had threatened to &quot;catch them, them two together, he was going to kill them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During their deliberations, the jury twice requested information from the court with respect to certain testimony.  In response to the requests the trial judge related to the jury his recollection of one witness's testimony, and had read to the jury from the transcript certain portions of testimony of one witness, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and the complete testimony of four witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts of the indictment, without a recommendation for mercy.  Defendant's motion for a new trial was overruled, and his appeal to the Court of Appeals resulted in an affirmance of the trial court's judgment.  Defendant's appeal is now before this court as a matter of right.  </SPAN></P>

The convictions were based on mostly circumstantial evidence. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred when it allowed the prosecution to exercise its sixth peremptory challenge on a juror after the prosecutor had expressed satisfaction with the jury, that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.21 was unconstitutional, that the verdicts were against the manifest weight of the evidence, that the refusal to dismiss a juror for cause deprived him of a fair trial, that the trial court permitted improper questioning, and that the trial court abused its discretion when it allowed testimony to be read to the jury. The court affirmed because &sect; 2945.21 was not unconstitutional and the passing of a turn had operated as a waiver of the right to make peremptory challenges. The court was convinced that the convictions were not against the weight of the evidence and that there was no error in the refusal to excuse a properly interrogated juror for cause. There was no error in the trial court's evidentiary rulings. Finally, the trial court properly allowed part of the testimony to be read to the jury during deliberations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs trucking companies brought an action in the Court of Common Pleas to enjoin the enforcement of Ordinance No. 69-2 of defendant, city of Lincoln Heights, which prohibits the operation upon Shepherd Lane, a residential street, of vehicles weighing more than 20,000 pounds.  In their petition, plaintiffs pray that &quot;said ordinance be declared invalid without legal effect, unconstitutional, null and void to the extent that it restricts the use of Shepherd Lane * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs also allege in their petition that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A substantial portion of the outgoing and incoming over-the-road traffic from the aforesaid terminals of the plaintiff carriers proceeds from their terminals to Interstate Route 75 for both northerly and southerly destinations and/or originations.  The shortest, safest and only reasonable way to travel between said terminals and Interstate Route 75 is over Shepherd Lane as it traverses the city of Lincoln Heights and all of said traffic involves motor vehicles capable of carrying loads which would increase their gross weight to in excess of the minimum prescribed by said Ordinance 69-2.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court stated, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in its opinion, that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since 1967, at the time of the development and location of plaintiffs' businesses in their present locations, truck traffic over Shepherd Lane has increased to a considerable degree and as a result thereof has increased the noise, vibration and safety hazards to some fifty families residing along Shepherd Lane between Wayne Avenue and I-75.  There is evidence that the vibrations have caused damage to homes in the area and the wear on Shepherd Lane has increased as a result of the additional heavy traffic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The evidence also discloses that there are alternate routes through the city of Lockland and/or through the city of Lockland and Cincinnati to gain access either northbound or southbound on I-75; that the use of the alternate routes would involve extra mileage for plaintiffs' trucks, the making of 90 degree turns in the city of Lockland, and travelling through areas involving as many as 300 homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court also said that, &quot;by reason of its almost entirely residential make-up, the city of Lincoln Heights acted in a reasonable and lawful manner in enacting Ordinance 69-2 and that said ordinance is therefore constitutional.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court denied the injunction&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and entered judgment for defendant city, holding &quot;that Ordinance No. 69-2 of the city of Lincoln Heights, Ohio, is reasonable in operation and effect; that said ordinance is, in all respects, valid and constitutional.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That judgment was appealed to the Court of Appeals on questions of law and fact.  That court found as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The effect of the ordinance before us is, substantially, to exclude trucks carrying or capable of carrying otherwise legal loads from the city of Lincoln Heights.  The ordinance prohibits all east-west movement through the city of such traffic and does not provide any route as an alternative to the use of Shepherd Lane to gain access to Interstate Route 75, either northbound or southbound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The city attempts to refute this by urging that plaintiffs do have alternative routes over which to travel to I-75 through the city of Lockland.  The evidence before us discloses that such routes are circuitous, through congested areas and considerably longer than the direct path afforded were the use of Shepherd Lane not prohibited.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals concluded that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ordinance No. 69-2 of the city of Lincoln Heights is invalid and unconstitutional in that it prohibits&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  unreasonably the use by trucks of a street which is adequate to accommodate them without providing a reasonable alternate route through Lincoln Heights.  Such prohibition is unnecessarily oppressive and bears no discernible relationship to the end sought to be achieved.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A city ordinance dictated that vehicles over a specified weight could not use a particular city street. Alternate routes were available for the larger vehicles, although the alternate routes were often less direct. On appeal, the court held that the ordinance was constitutional. The court held that the city was allowed to reasonably control the weight of vehicles using its highways and streets and that the limitations in the disputed ordinance were reasonable. The means adopted by the ordinance bore a real and substantial relation to their purpose and were suitable to the end in view. Furthermore, the availability of alternate routes supported the reasonableness of the ordinance. The fact that the alternate routes were circuitous or that the prohibited route was the shortest route were not sufficient to establish that the ordinance was either unduly oppressive or that it interfered with private rights beyond the necessities of the situation. The evidence in the court of appeals demanded a finding that the ordinance was reasonable and lawful.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant urged the court to declare Ordinance 1701.01 unconstitutional and, also, to determine that she was convicted upon insufficient evidence. The fire chief testified that he phoned the home of the person he thought owned the apartment in question. When he asked the woman who had answered the phone if he could search the apartment, she told the chief to get a warrant. Defendant's conviction was based solely on the chief's testimony concerning his telephone conversation with the woman, whom he alleged was defendant. The fire chief was unable to recognize defendant's voice over the telephone or in person.

Both drivers began their trips in Ohio and would have ended them there. Decedent's survivors filed suit in an Ohio court of common pleas for wrongful death against the trucking company. The trucking company argued that Illinois law applied and offered to confess judgment for the limits of the Illinois Wrongful Death Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 70, para. 2. The court of common pleas entered judgment for the survivors in that amount. On appeal, the court held that the rule of lex loci delicti was not applicable because Ohio had substantial governmental interests in the litigation due to its concerns that the next of kin of an Ohio resident be fairly compensated and that the decedent's estate be lawfully administered. Illinois, however, had no interest in the suit. The trucking company employee admitted liability for negligence, and therefore, Illinois did not even have the interest of compelling compliance with its traffic laws.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action under the Ohio Workmen's Compensation Act in which plaintiff-appellee, a school teacher who fell on a flight of stairs at a school and received personal injuries, seeks an award based on the &quot;percentage of his [her] permanent partial disability resulting from the injury&quot; under the provisions of R. C. 4123.57.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts are not in dispute, having been stipulated in the trial court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff was employed by the Cleveland Board of Education.  When she fell, on September 30, 1964, she sustained a fracture of the third metacarpal of her left hand, and abrasions and contusions over other parts of her body.  A cast was applied and was worn for seven and one-half weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her claim was allowed by the Bureau of Workmen's Compensation, and medical bills paid.  She received no temporary total compensation, being absent from work for only three days, and has never received any compensation for partial disability.  As the result of the injury, plaintiff, who is left-handed, has permanent residual disability diagnosed as fibrositis of the paracapsular structures of the left ring finger, resulting in limitation of motion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Plaintiff, on September 16, 1966, filed with the Industrial Commission an application for a determination of the percentage of her permanent partial disability resulting from the injury.

The court held that the tax ordinance did not violate Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 15, which provided that no person could be imprisoned for debt in any civil action except in cases of fraud. The court found that a debt was an obligation to pay money and that a tax was a debt. One could not be imprisoned for mere failure to pay taxes. Because the tax ordinance contained the term &quot;refuse,&quot; which implied willfulness or intent, the court held that only a wilful failure or refusal to pay the tax was punishable by imprisonment.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 5, 1965, Gates Mills Investment Company, appellee herein, submitted to the planning commission of the village of Pepper Pike, Ohio, a plat for a subdivision of land.  The commission refused to approve the plat.

Named as defendants were members of the village council and the planning commission of the village of Pepper Pike and the Recorder of Cuyahoga County.  The trial court found that the plat was entitled to be recorded.

The commission refused to approve the plat. The developer filed a petition seeking a decree requiring the county recorder to record the plat of the proposed subdivision. The trial court found that the plat was entitled to have been recorded and the court of appeals affirmed. Appellants sought review. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 711.09, the legislative authority of a village which had a planning commission was not permitted to legislate a plan or rules and regulations governing plats and subdivisions of land. Under &sect; 711.09 the village legislative authority could only have adopted a plan if there was not commission. The village had a commission, and therefore, it was not permitted to have adopted the ordinances constituting the village plan. Accordingly, the commission's refusal to approve the plat was based on village ordinances which were improper under &sect; 711.09.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant-appellant, Thomas A. Thompson, and another person were observed by a control tower operator at the Port Columbus Airport at about 4:00 a. m. on December 20, 1968, pushing automobile tires toward a car in the airport parking lot.  The two men placed three tires alongside the car and then entered the car.  Some minutes later, a police officer, who had been summoned by the control tower operator, approached the two men who were still seated in the parked car.  The officer asked them what they were doing and was told that they had been looking for a set of keys which had been lost in the parking lot.  They denied rolling the tires, which were then up against the passenger side of the vehicle in which they were seated, to this car, and an examination of other vehicles in the parking lot failed to reveal any with missing wheels and tires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police officer arrested appellant and seized the tires.  Subsequently, appellant was charged with being a suspicious person.  The affidavit filed by the officer recited that appellant &quot;* * * did unlawfully loiter and wander about a public place, street, to wit: Port Columbus parking&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  lot * * * to wit: Was prowling cars, trying to get into them, and was seen rolling tires from rental car area to side of his car * * *.  Sect. 2387.02 G without being able to give a reasonable and satisfactory account of himself, contrary to the ordinance of said city * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At appellant's trial in Municipal Court, the arresting officer testified that from the time of arrest to the date of trial no one had claimed the seized tires and there had been no report that they were stolen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant's motion to dismiss the affidavit on the ground that the Columbus suspicious person ordinance, Section 2387.02 (G), was unconstitutional was overruled by the trial court.  Appellant was found guilty and sentenced to 60 days in the workhouse and fined $ 100 and costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal to the Court of Appeals, appellant renewed his contentions in relation to the constitutionality of the ordinance.  That court held the ordinance to be constitutional and affirmed the judgment of the Municipal Court.  However, the Court of Appeals found its judgment to be in conflict with a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County in the case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cleveland </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> Forrest</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, case No. 28,446, and certified&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the cause to this court for review and final determination.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed his conviction for being suspicious person, a violation of Columbus, Ohio, Ordinances &sect; 2387.02(G). Defendant raised the constitutionality of the ordinance as grounds for his appeal. Although the Court of Appeals for Franklin County held that the ordinance was constitutional and affirmed the conviction, it certified the cause to the court for review and final determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After defendant was observed by a control tower operator at an airport pushing tires toward a car in the airport parking lot at 4:00 a.m., defendant was arrested and charged with being a suspicious person under &sect; 2387.02(G). Defendant was convicted as charged, and he appealed claiming that the ordinance under which he was convicted was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that the ordinance was constitutional and affirmed defendant's conviction. The appellate court, however, certified the cause to the court for review and final determination. The court reversed the appellate court's judgment. Wandering about, as it applied under the ordinance to all citizens, was too indefinite, restrictive, and liberty depriving to have satisfied due-process requirements. The ordinance left the public uncertain as to the conduct it prohibited and left judges and jurors free to decide, without any legally fixed standards, what was prohibited and what was not in each particular case. Thus, the ordinance lacked ascertainable standards of guilt and violated the due-process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Consequently, it was invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the appellate court's judgment, which held that the city ordinance penalizing a person for wandering the streets was constitutional and affirmed defendant's conviction under that statute.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, the court first held that the evidence of an episode at a motel was admissible because it tended to prove all the important elements of Ohio Rev.

Rather, the court noted that the statute had been declared constitutional. Lastly, the court rejected defendant's argument that the evidence was insufficient to prove an intentional killing in the commission of a robbery, which was required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.01. Instead, the court concluded that the evidence constituted an inescapable web of circumstances which showed that all the elements of the crime of murder during the commission of a robbery were present.</SPAN></P>

The owner filed his answer after purporting to receive an extension of time from the trial court pursuant to Lucas County, Ohio, Ct. C.P. R. 7, which allowed the trial court's assignment commissioner to grant a 30 day extension of time in which to file pleadings. The City waited several months before filing a motion to strike the answer based upon its untimeliness under Ohio Rev.

The trial court denied the motions, the City did not appeal their denial, and the matter went to trial. The City unsuccessfully asserted the trial court's error in granting an extension of time on appeal. In affirming that court held that the time limitation set out in &sect; 163.08 was mandatory and the trial court did not have authority to extend the time to answer. The City waived its claim as to the untimely filed answer, however, by abandoning its right to appeal the trial court's order denying its motion to strike, which was an appealable order.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the deprivation of the use of the evidence suppressed would render it virtually impossible for the State to obtain a conviction, and that without the evidence the prosecution would have been terminated.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 29, 1965, Union Savings Association obtained a judgment against Home Owners Aid, Inc., and other codefendants, by virtue of confession as authorized by the warrant of attorney to confess judgment, on a promissory note upon which the corporate codefendant and other individual codefendants appeared as comakers.  One of the individual codefendants, Howard Kirsch, also president of Home Owners, filed a petition to vacate the judgment as to himself personally.  A petition to vacate the judgment and stay execution, filed by Home Owners, sets forth that it is appearing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">in propria persona</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and is indigent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The corporation alleged that it was indigent. It contended that Ohio corporate statutes either provided or implied that the corporation was the same as a natural person in all respects, including the right to represent itself in propria persona. It asserted constitutional protection for the right to litigate in propria persona. The supreme court concluded that the corporation and a natural living person were not in all respects equal because the statutes and general assembly did not give a corporation all the rights and privileges of a natural person. Accordingly, the corporation's alleged indigence had no relevance. The procedure requiring a corporation to appear through an attorney in no way deprived the corporation of its constitutional rights because it had, by the laws of the state, a fair trial in a court of justice, according to the applicable modes of proceeding. Regarding the corporation's impairment of contract argument, the evidence failed to show that the corporation ever had the right to defend itself in propria persona. As the corporation did not show the possession of the right, impairment was impossible.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court sustained defendant's demurrer on the ground that there is no cause of action in Ohio for Mrs. Clouston's loss of her husband's services and the loss of her husband's consortium.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant automobile dealership sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals for Stark County (Ohio), which reversed a decision that had sustained appellant's demurrer to appellee wife's action for loss of her husband's consortium after her husband was injured in an accident caused by the negligence of appellant's agent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee wife brought a lawsuit against appellant automobile dealership in which she alleged that her husband had been injured in an accident caused by the negligence of appellant's agent. On her own behalf, appellee sought damages for loss of her husband's consortium. The trial court sustained appellant's demurrer on that point, but the court of appeals reversed. Appellant sought review and the court affirmed. The court found that the trial court had sustained the demurrer on the basis of the common law rule, which was that only a husband could recover consortium damages. The court said that that rule was based on the ancient fiction that a husband and wife were one, with the one being the husband. The court said that the modern view, as espoused in numerous statutes that proclaimed that the wife could hold property in her own right, had not recognized that fiction. Also, the court stated that it had long been the rule that a wife could recover consortium damages from a tortfeasor who intentionally injured the husband. Therefore, the court held that appellee could have recovered loss of consortium damages for an injury to her husband caused by the negligence of appellant's agent.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the common law rule that only a husband could recover consortium damages after a negligent injury to his wife was no longer valid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case is concerned with fish, not as in the &quot;pretty kettle of fish&quot; of Gilbert and Sullivan's Iolanthe but in tanks of walleyed pike, the yellow pike of the gastronome's dream.  And we do not have to be mindful of the time-honored maxim &quot;piscatorial pursuits are conducive to mendacity&quot; in our consideration of the facts, because the fish in the tanks were acquired by a rodless Walton of the lakes, a bloodless sportsman, one Cletus Switzer, appellant herein.  In March 1968, he bought, for the purpose of resale in the United States, approximately 2,750 walleyed pike in Ontario, Canada, where the legal limit on length was 14 inches.  Appellant then transported those fish through Canadian and United States Customs and thence through Michigan and Indiana to Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant intended to stop at his home in Morrow, Ohio, change the water in the fish tanks and proceed to find a buyer for the fish.  On the road to Morrow, he was stopped by agents of the Division of Wildlife of Ohio who inspected the fish.  After some of the fish were measured and it was discovered that they were undersized according to Ohio law, appellant was charged, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  pursuant to the provisions of R.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Data Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holiday Inns of America, leases terminals, which function somewhat like teletypewriters, for use in the international reservation system for Holiday Inns.  Each motel operated under the name &quot;Holiday Inns of America&quot; has a terminal which is connected by leased wires to central computers in Memphis, Tennessee.  All communications must be routed through the Memphis computers, and it is impossible to use a terminal at one inn to communicate with another inn without going through the Memphis computers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The terminals are used in conjunction with the central computers to make various types of reservations, to cancel reservations, to check on room availability, and to transmit administrative data.  The terminals function as input devices to transmit information for storage in and use by the Memphis computers, and as output typewriters printing messages received from the computers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Data's witness, Long, testified before the Board of Tax Appeals that there are about 1,000 Holiday Inns using the system.  Ninety-nine per cent of the use of the terminals is for transmitting messages regarding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  room reservations, while approximately one per cent of the use is devoted to other purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sample standard type lease agreement used by General Data and its lessees, appellee's exhibit B, recites that, at the 19th Annual Conference of the International Association of Holiday Inns, the association voted &quot;that the installation in all Holiday Inns of the new computer-type central reservation control system be a requirement of the Rules of Operation of the International System, and by such act did authorize Holiday Inns of America, Inc., to arrange for such a 'system,' and Holiday Inns of America, Inc., did contract with the International Business Machine Corporation, hereinafter referred to as 'IBM,' for such a 'system' and did contract to lease the 'terminals' for use in this 'system' from C. C. Leasing Company, and which lease has been assigned to General Data Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holiday Inns of America, Inc.; and a majority of the members present at the above described meeting did also vote to charge each member of the International Association of Holiday Inns (each member of the International Association being a 'licensee' of Holiday Inns of America, Inc.) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  two and 50/100 dollars ($ 2.50) per rental guest room per month as a requirement of the Rules of Operation </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">for the purpose of and as the method of payment for the computer-type central reservation control system</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * * *.&quot; (Emphasis added.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each of the inns enters a similar lease agreement with General Data and the monthly charge ($ 2.50) per rental guest room increases or decreases only if the number of rooms changes.  The evidence shows that General Data pays a third-party leasing firm $ 82.99 for the rental of one type terminal and $ 154 for another heavy duty model used in inns of over two hundred rooms, although the time for which such charge is made is not disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tax Commissioner, under Section 5741.02, Revised Code, assessed General Data for use taxes based upon the rentals collected for the terminals.  General Data appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals, which reversed the Tax Commissioner's order on the following grounds: (1) The tax was a tax levied on activity in interstate commerce, which is excepted under Section 5741.02(C)(3), Revised Code, and (2) the terminals were being rented and used directly in making retail sales, which use is excepted from taxation under&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sections 5741.02(C)(2) and 5739.01(E)(2), Revised Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tax Commissioner has appealed to this court, contending that the board erred in its ruling reversing the commissioner's order of assessment.  </SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the board's decision. The use tax was not levied and assessed on the transaction wherein the property came to rest in Ohio, but was levied and assessed on a rental charge made by the tax commissioner both for the use of the terminals and their use in the computerized system by the various hotels across the country. As the assessment was based on charges per room, per month, after the terminals were used in interstate commerce as a part of an international computerized system of motel room reservations, the assessment was an unlawful tax burden on interstate commerce. Also, because the terminals were used in making sales for a motel's consumers, they fit within a second exception.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burt Realty Corporation owns two parcels of real property on the east side of High Street between 15th and 16th Avenues in Columbus, Ohio.  The area was, prior to 1963 and still is, zoned for commercial use.  In that year, Columbus adopted uncodified Ordinance No. 313-63, which establishes the building setback line from High Street in this area at a minimum of 65 feet from the center of the street and prohibits any above-ground use of the property, including parking, within that limitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The existing buildings on each parcel front on High Street.  They pre-date the adoption of the 1963 ordinance, are devoted to uses permitted in the applicable commercial district, but are situated only 32.5 feet from the center of the street.  Thus, the 1963 setback line cuts through the buildings to the extent of 32.5 feet and affects approximately 35% of the combined parcels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The buildings are now deteriorating and the owner desires to reconstruct and replace them on their present locus.  After being refused a building permit for such purpose, the owner brought this action against&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Columbus in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County for a declaratory judgment, challenging the constitutionality of the 1963 ordinance as it applies to its property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was tried upon a stipulation of facts which fail to disclose whether it is economically feasible and physically possible for Burt Realty to rebuild on the remainder of its real estate unaffected by the setback ordinance without suffering loss of value to the property taken as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court granted a declaratory judgment as prayed for.  The Court of Appeals reversed and dismissed the action, holding that plaintiff was not entitled to a declaratory judgment because it had not exhausted its administrative remedies.  </SPAN></P>

The court found that the location of the owner's buildings was a use of land which was protected from conforming to new ordinance upon replacement of the buildings.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants challenged a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County (Ohio) affirming their convictions for violating Cincinnati, Ohio Code of Ordinances &sect; 901-L6.Defendants sought to have the ordinance declared to be in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 3, for the reasons that it was vague and imprecise as to what conduct was proscribed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The ordinance provided that it was be unlawful for three or more persons to assemble, except at a public meeting of citizens, on any of the sidewalks, street corners, vacant lots, or mouths of alleys, and there conduct themselves in a manner that was annoying to persons passing by, or occupants of adjacent buildings. The ordinances further stated that whoever violated any of the provisions of the section would be fined not exceeding $ 50.00, or be imprisoned not less than 1 nor more than 30 days or both. The court noted that U.S. Const. amend. I provided that the United States Congress was not to make laws that abridged the right of the people to peaceably assemble. Further, Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 3 provided that the people had the right to assemble together, in a peaceable manner. The court noted that both the federal and state constitutions contemplated that the right to assemble would be asserted and enjoyed in a peaceable manner. On appeal, the court affirmed defendants' convictions because the affidavits charged assembly and a course of conduct that was annoying to persons passing by. The court found that the word &quot;annoying&quot; was widely used and well understood, not vague.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant herein, Herbert G. Starnes, was charged by the city of Toledo with the offense of driving while under the influence of alcohol.  The arresting officer asked appellant to give a chemical test specimen, but appellant refused.  Subsequently, appellant pleaded guilty in Toledo Municipal Court to being in physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the provisions of Section 4511.191(D), Revised Code, the Registrar of Motor Vehicles suspended appellant's driver's license because of his refusal to submit to a chemical test to determine if he was under the influence of alcohol at the time of his arrest.  Appellant filed a petition in the Municipal Court, pursuant to Section 4511.191(F), Revised Code, contesting the validity of the suspension of his license.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A hearing was held in the Municipal Court, and the court affirmed the order of suspension.  At the hearing, appellant contended that Section 4511.191, Revised Code, is unconstitutional.

Without extensive analysis, the court rejected defendant's arguments that the statute permitted unreasonable searches and seizures in contravention of the Fourth Amendment or compelled a person to be a witness against himself in a criminal prosecution in contravention of the Fifth Amendment. The court then held that the implied consent statute did not violate due process because proceedings under &sect; 4511.191(F) were civil and administrative in nature, and a burden of proof less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt was sufficient for a valid suspension of a driver's license.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals (Ohio) affirmed the decision of the trial court. The bureau filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The widow's husband sustained a work-related injury. Subsequently, he died from his injury. The Bureau denied the widow's claim for benefits based upon its finding that the claim failed to state any right to recovery under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.59, as amended in 1963. The widow appealed. The trial court overruled the demurrer filed on behalf of the Bureau and entered judgment in favor of the widow. The intermediate appellate court affirmed, holding that the portion of &sect; 4123.59 at issue violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26, the equal protection clause, for that reason that it failed to afford equal treatment to all persons in the same class. On review, the court reversed the judgment of the intermediate appellate court. The court found that the 1963 amendment to the statute, which eliminated the widow's basis for recovery, was constitutionally valid. While the court found that the application of a portion of the section could lead to arbitrary and capricious results, the court found that the remainder of the statute was valid. The court held, however, that even under the valid remaining portions of the statute, the widow was not entitled to prevail on her claim.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1965, Eugene W. Duling, appellant herein, was convicted by a jury of murder in the first degree, without a recommendation of mercy, and was sentenced to death for the killing of a police officer.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of conviction and this court dismissed an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeals on the ground that no substantial constitutional question was involved.  Upon appeal, the Supreme Court of the United States denied a petition for a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June 1967, appellant filed a petition for postconviction relief in the Court of Common Pleas, raising the same arguments as in the original appeal.  At the same time, he also filed a motion for new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence.  Relief was denied in both instances.  Appeal was then taken to the Court of Appeals and subsequently was voluntarily dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 1968, appellant refiled in the Court of Common Pleas his original petition for postconviction relief and the motion for new trial.

Defendant unsuccessfully moved for postconviction relief and for a new trial, and on appeal challenged the selection of his jury. Prior to his appellate hearing, the Supreme Court of Ohio handed down a decision governing the process for selecting and rejecting jurors. Defendant did not attach the transcript of the voir dire examination in his action before the lower appellate court, but did in his action before the court. The court affirmed the lower appellate court, finding that some prospective jurors were excused even though they did not proclaim opposition to the death penalty regardless of the evidence, but the court also found that the trial judge adhered to U.S. Const. amend. VI and to Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court noted that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.25 conformed to the new decision, and that defendant could have raised the same questions as were raised in that case.

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Revised Code Section 305.171: &quot;The board of county commissioners of any county may procure and pay all or any part of the cost of group hospitalization, surgical, major medical, or sickness and accident insurance or a combination of any of the foregoing types of insurance or coverage for county officers and employees and their immediate dependents, whether issued by an insurance company or a hospital service association duly authorized to do business in this state.&quot; (132 Ohio Laws 252, 2688, effective November 24, 1967.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">The section was amended (133 Ohio Laws S 112, effective September 23, 1969) by inserting after the word &quot;dependents,&quot; the following: &quot;from the funds or budgets from which said officers or employees are compensated for services.&quot; The amendment does not control the premium involved in this case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the respondent county auditor charged the cost of the premiums entirely to the general fund of the county, relators commenced this action for a writ of mandamus to compel the respondent to pay or apportion from funds other than the general fund that portion of the premiums attributable to those county employees whose regular compensation is paid from those funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, the respondent county auditor refused to pay that part of the premium attributable to the elected county officers whose terms of office had commenced prior to the board's action procuring the insurance.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals denied the relief sought by the original petition but held that the payment of premiums on behalf of elected county officers are not &quot;compensation and salary&quot; and granted a writ of mandamus against the respondent county auditor in accordance with the prayer of the supplemental petition.

Further, in the absence of an appropriation by appellant board, respondent county auditor had no duty to apportion the premium cost among the various funds of the county.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, Michael L. Baker, was charged in Juvenile Court with being a delinquent child.  The complaint stated that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michael Lee Baker, age 17 years, who appears to be a delinquent child in that he did knowingly sell or make available to minors under 16 years of age a drug or powder containing an ingredient deleterious to health, specifically a substance containing a preparation of the poisonous compounds belladonna and stramonium; said substances being capable of causing complete confusion with hallucinations, contrary to Sections 3719.31, 3719.32 and 3719.42 of the Revised Code of the state of Ohio.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant entered a plea of not guilty.  At the trial, there was evidence that appellant sold some &quot;brown powder&quot; to other juveniles and that the powder was taken orally by some of them by teaspoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the trial, the Juvenile Court made the following findings:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Based on the evidence and testimony that the court has heard today, the court is of the opinion that the evidence * * * does substantiate the allegation in the complaint that Michael Lee Baker was a delinquent child on December 29, 1967, and the court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  will so adjudicate that he was a delinquent child as of December 29, 1967.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * The finding of the court * * * is that Michael Lee Baker * * * is a delinquent or was a delinquent on December 29, 1967, by virtue of a fact he committed the acts alleged in a complaint filed in this case and in that the acts fall within Revised Code Section 2151.02, sub-paragraph D.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the provisions of Section 2151.35 (E), Revised Code, the Juvenile Court then committed appellant to the Ohio State Reformatory at Mansfield.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, a juvenile, appealed from a judgment that adjudicated him a delinquent for selling a drug containing ingredients capable of causing hallucinations in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3719.31, 3719.32, 3719.42 and that committed him to the reformatory under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.35(E). The Court of Appeals for Hocking County (Ohio) affirmed but certified the record for review and final determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued that the statute under which he had been committed was unconstitutional. He also argued that certain evidence had been improperly admitted into evidence and that the determination that he was guilty of acts that would be a felony if he were an adult was improper. The court found that: (1) it was unnecessary to consider the constitutional issue in light of the disposition of other errors; (2) while the medicine given by defendant to other juveniles did contain prohibited substances justifying a finding of delinquency, the question remained whether the acts involved actually would have constituted a felony; (3) where the testimony was conflicting as to whether the drug was a hallucinatory drug, there had been a failure to show that the acts charged would have been a felony if committed by an adult; and (4) it was necessary to resentence defendant based upon the correct application of the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the adjudication of delinquency but reversed the part of the judgment committing defendant to the reformatory and remanded for proper resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 30, 1968, petitioner, Walter Strattman was found guilty in the Hamilton County Municipal Court of making a false report to the police in violation of Section 901-f3 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Cincinnati, Ohio. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was given the maximum authorized sentence of six months in the Cincinnati workhouse and assessed a fine of $ 500 and costs.

<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to report or cause to be reported any felony or misdemeanor, or to give any information relating to such felony or misdemeanor, to the division of police or to any member of said division, by telephone, in writing or by any other communication, knowing that no such felony or misdemeanor has in fact been committed.

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 18, 1969, petitioner filed a pauper's affidavit with the Municipal Court; and on April 22, 1969, he filed a petition for habeas corpus in the Court of Appeals.  A memorandum supporting his petition alleged that his continued incarceration deprived him of his rights of due process and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Petitioner contended further that the Municipal Court abused its discretion in sentencing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  him to both the maximum prison term and the maximum fine and costs, when the imposition of the fine and costs in reality meant further incarceration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals dismissed the petition, holding that the petitioner was not denied equal protection and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.  It should be noted that, although the pauper's affidavit was filed in the Court of Appeals prior to the hearing on the writ of habeas corpus, there is nothing in the record to indicate petitioner's indigency at the time of sentencing by the Municipal Court.  Moreover, the record does not reveal when or how the sentencing court implemented the provisions of Section 2947.20, Revised Code.  Inasmuch as the parties do not argue those points, we assume that the procedural requirements of the statute were met and that petitioner is indigent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals certified the record to this court, finding that its judgment was in conflict with the case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In re Petition of Cole</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 17 Ohio App. 2d 207, decided by the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, which held that a court abuses its discretion by imposing a sentence which results in imprisonment in default of payment of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fine which exceeds the maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed as an original sentence.  </SPAN></P>

Thus, he was further confined pursuant to &sect; 2947.20. The court of appeals dismissed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The court of appeals certified the record to the court, finding that its judgment was in conflict with a case decided by another appellate court. The court reversed the court of appeals' judgment, holding that &sect; 2947.20 as applied to an indigent defendant who had served the maximum incarceration authorized by the substantive statute, violated the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court determined that a three dollars per day credit on an unpaid fine was so unreasonable that it unfairly discriminated against petitioner. Petitioner was able to decide whether three dollars was equal to a day in jail but he was unable to manifest his choice. The court noted that a judgment for costs in a criminal case was a civil, not a criminal, obligation, and that as such it was only collectable by the methods provided for the collection of civil judgments. Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 15 expressly prohibited imprisonment for civil debt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator, Carl Hofstetter, was elected and served as a Geauga County Court Judge from 1959 through 1962.  On November 6, 1962, he was re-elected for the term 1963 through 1966.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1963, the General Assembly enacted Section 1901.02, Revised Code, creating the Chardon Municipal Court and giving it jurisdiction within Geauga County, effective July 11, 1963.  Section 1901.04, Revised Code, provides &quot;that upon the institution of a municipal court, the jurisdiction of county courts * * * in all civil and criminal causes terminates in any township or municipal corporation which is entirely within the territory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After relator served through the year 1963, the respondent auditor refused to issue payroll vouchers or to establish funds for paying relator as judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 1964, the Chardon Municipal Court began operation.  Relator alleges that the prosecuting attorney filed a mandamus action in the Court of Common Pleas seeking an order compelling him to turn over his court records and other property as required by Section 1901.04, Revised Code.  A writ of mandamus was issued ordering relator to surrender this property.  Relator complied&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with the writ and did not prosecute an appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December 1967, relator filed a mandamus action in the Court of Appeals requesting the issuance of various writs of mandamus which would, in essence, require respondents to pay relator his salary as county court judge for the years 1964 through 1966, plus interest.  Relator claims that Section 15, Article IV of the Ohio Constitution, prohibits any change, addition or diminution which will result in the vacation of the office of any judge during term, notwithstanding the fact that the office of county judge was created by statute, and that the legislation which established Chardon Municipal Court with county-wide jurisdiction unconstitutionally deprived him of his office.  The Court of Appeals, holding that the General Assembly having created relator's office could abolish it, sustained a demurrer to the writ and overruled motions to strike the demurrer and for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judge filed a mandamus action requesting the issuance of various writ of mandamus which would require the auditor to pay him his salary as a county court judge for the balance of his term plus interest. The lower court, holding that the Ohio General Assembly, having created his office, could abolish it, sustained a demurrer to the writ and overruled motions to strike the demurrer and for reconsideration. Upon the judge's appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, holding that the principle of collateral estoppel barred the judge from litigating an issue which had already been decided by a court of competent jurisdiction. Inasmuch as the previous mandamus order, which directed relator to surrender all the records and other property of the county court to the municipal court, was not appealed, the judge was barred from prosecuting this action, and because the question in both cases was identical, and under the real party in interest analysis the same parties were involved, the judge was estopped from relitigating that question.</SPAN></P>

After overruling a motion for a new trial, the trial court sentenced defendant to death in the electric chair. Defendant argued that he was denied his constitutional right to a fair trial when potential jurors were excused for cause because their opinions precluded them from finding the accused guilty of an offense punishable by death. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and concluded that defendant was not denied a fair trial since only four of the 29 jurors were excused because of their opinions regarding capital punishment. The court ruled that defendant was not prejudiced by the jury charge given on the issue of insanity and ruled that defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court's refusal to permit a medical expert from answering hypothetical questions regarding defendant's excessive use of drugs and their possible affects on his mental state. The court found that defendant, by asserting his right against self-incrimination, was not denied his right to present evidence of mitigation on the issue of punishment since witnesses could and did present such testimony.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee is the owner of two tracts of real estate situated in the unincorporated territory of Huntington Township, Brown County, Ohio.  Her real estate borders on land owned by Virgil Cooper.  Appellants are the members of the Board of Trustees of Huntington Township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April 1966, Virgil Cooper filed a complaint with the trustees pursuant to Section 971.01 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Revised Code, which directs the trustees, upon complaint, to view the premises of adjoining landowners and assign to each owner his equal share of a partition line fence to be constructed and kept in repair.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles E. and Robert E. Buckley, appellants herein, operate a junk yard (Buckley's Auto Wrecking) in Summit County.  On January 30, 1965, the county prosecuting attorney filed an application in the Court of Common Pleas to abate the operation of this yard as a nuisance under Sections 4737.05 to 4737.99, Revised Code, hereinafter referred to as the junk-yard statutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Buckleys cross-petitioned for a declaratory judgment to test the constitutionality of those statutes, and impleaded as new parties the county auditor, the sheriff and the Attorney General of Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court held that those parts of the junk-yard statutes which define fences, which create a legislative nuisance where there are no fences, and which provide for enforcement are vague, indefinite, and unconstitutional.  The court held also that the exemption of scrap processing dealers was unreasonably discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal, the Court of Appeals found the statutes constitutional and reversed that portion of the judgment of the trial court which held the junk-yard statutes unconstitutional in part.

The court held that the statutes were properly supported by aesthetic considerations because interference with the natural aesthetics of the surrounding countryside caused by an unfenced or inadequately fenced junk yard was generally patent and gross, and not merely a matter of taste. However, the court cautioned that its holding was not a blanket approval of all regulation based upon aesthetics.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Josephine Baston bore a child, William Curtis Baston, out of wedlock in 1962.  She subsequently married a man other than the father of the child.  In 1964, after her marriage, she brought an action for a declaratory judgment on behalf of the child, as his next friend, in the Juvenile Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County.

On further appeal, the court reversed the intermediate appellate court's decision and affirmed the trial court's judgment. According to the court, there was no common-law or statutory right for an illegitimate child to receive support from its father. The court held that, because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.42 made no provision for a civil action and gave no substantive right of enforcement of support to the mother's illegitimate child, the decision of the intermediate court was legislative, and thus, invalid.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant herein is the owner of lot No. 225, Trophy Estates Plat No. 5, situated in Austintown Township, Mahoning County, Ohio.  Appellees herein are the duly elected and acting trustees of Austintown Township and the duly appointed and acting zoning inspector of Austintown Township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant's property consists of slightly more than 15 acres, having a frontage of 741 feet on the west side of Racoon Road in Austintown Township, and a depth of approximately 843 feet.  Originally, as part of a 1948 zoning ordinance, this land was zoned entirely Residence R-1 (single family residences only).  However, wishing to construct apartment dwellings on the tract, appellant succeeded, in 1959, in obtaining a Residence R-2 (multiple family residences) classification for a portion 741 feet wide along Racoon Road, 325 feet deep along the northerly property line and 480 feet deep along the southerly property line.  In early 1966, appellant applied to the zoning commission of Austintown Township to rezone the remainder of the tract to a Residence R-2 classification.  The zoning commission of Austintown Township and the Mahoning County Planning&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Commission approved the application, but the trustees of Austintown Township modified the recommendation of the zoning commission and rezoned the land Residence R-2 to a depth of only 525 feet in all, leaving the remainder of the lot zoned as Residence R-1.  Appellant then brought this action for a declaratory judgment in the Common Pleas Court of Mahoning County, seeking a determination that appellee-trustees acted arbitrarily, unreasonably and unlawfully, a determination that the zoning amendment is unconstitutional, and an order of the court requiring appellee zoning inspector to issue the necessary permits to allow appellant to construct apartment dwellings on the property in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the pendency of the proceedings in the Common Pleas Court, a duly executed referendum petition was filed with the Austintown Township trustees, in accordance with the provisions of Section 519.12, Revised Code.  This petition requested submission of the 1966 zoning amendment to the township electorate at the November 8, 1966, general election.  The referendum petition was complied with, and resulted in the voters of Austintown Township rejecting the 1966 zoning change by a vote of 5,993 to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1,441.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 30, 1966, without giving any consideration to the result of the referendum, the Common Pleas Court decided the issues in this cause adversely to appellant, and accordingly gave judgment for appellees.  An appeal on questions of law and fact was prosecuted from that decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the Court of Appeals took judicial notice of the referendum and dismissed the appeal, finding that the referendum had restored appellant's property to its 1959 status, and that the Common Pleas Court judgment was void.  The Court of Appeals found constitutionally valid those provisions of Section 519.12, Revised Code, giving the right of referendum to the electors of a township on zoning amendments passed by the township trustees, and decided that there was &quot;no longer a debatable issue to be determined.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The owner brought an action for declaratory judgment and sought a determination that the Trustees acted arbitrarily and that the zoning amendment was unconstitutional. During the pendency of the action, a referendum petition was filed with the Trustees, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.12, which rejected the zoning change. Thus, the trial court found in favor of the Trustees. The appellate court voided the trial court's judgment and dismissed the appeal because there was no longer a debatable issue to be determined. The owner appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the court found no constitutional impediment to the power granted to the Trustees to make zoning resolutions and that &sect; 519.12 was constitutional.

The basis of that &quot;motion&quot; was that the indictment was insufficient in that it did not specify the type and length of the weapon.  The trial court did not appoint counsel under Section 2945.67, Revised Code.  The Court of Appeals overruled the prosecutor's application for permission to file a bill of exceptions on the ground that it had &quot;no jurisdiction to entertain&quot; the same on the basis&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Dodge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (10 Ohio App. 2d 92).

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant is the owner of the Chesapeake Trailer Park in the village of Chesapeake, Ohio.  He brought this action in the Lawrence County Court of Common Pleas to enjoin the enforcement of village ordinances Nos. 348 and 349.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pertinent parts of ordinance No. 348 set forth certain health and sanitary regulations for house trailer parks operated within the village and provide for the licensing of such parks.  Compliance with the regulations and payment of the license or permit fee of $ 25 per year for the first two trailer spaces and two dollars for each additional space are the primary requisites for obtaining a permit.  Any person operating a trailer park in the village without a village permit may be fined up to $ 50 for each day of operation.  The appellant operated his trailer park without obtaining a permit, and consequently the city prosecuted him for violating ordinance No. 348.  Upon the commencement of that prosecution the appellant brought the present action for injunction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ordinance No. 349 purports to regulate the use of house trailers within the village.  It requires any person locating a house trailer in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  any house trailer park within the village to obtain a yearly permit, which will be issued to him upon the approval of the town marshal and the payment of a $ 36 fee.  A penalty of not more than $ 50 for each day of noncompliance is provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant contends that these ordinances violate Section 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution, which limits local police, sanitary and other similar regulations to those not in conflict with general laws.  The allegedly conflicting laws are Sections 3733.03 to 3733.07, Revised Code, concerning the licensing of trailer parks, and Section 4503.06, Revised Code, concerning taxes on house trailers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Common Pleas issued a temporary restraining order, but later dissolved it, finding that the ordinances did not conflict with the state statutes.  The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal, holding that an injunction action was not proper because the pending criminal proceeding provides an adequate remedy at law.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The village issued ordinances regulating trailer parks. The trailer park owner sought to enjoin the enforcement of the ordinances on the ground that they were unconstitutional. The temporary restraining order was issued, and then was dissolved. The court of appeals affirmed the dissolution on the ground that the ordinances did not conflict with state statutes. The trailer park owner sought review of the decision. The court noted that Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3 provided municipalities with the authority to exercise all powers of self-government and to adopt and enforce local police, sanitary, and other similar regulations, as were not in conflict with general laws. Since one of the ordinances forbade and prohibited that which was directly permitted and allowed by state statute, that ordinance was in conflict with state statutes, and was prohibited. Thus the injunctive relief sought by the trailer park owner should have been granted as to that ordinance. As to the remaining ordinance, the court concluded that it was not violative of state statute and thus was not subject to injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment of the court of appeals with regard to one ordinance was affirmed, but their decision with regard to another ordinance was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeals in an action in prohibition originally filed in that court.  Relator, appellee herein, in his petition alleges that respondents, the Governor, Secretary of State and Auditor of State, acting as the Apportionment Board, adopted an apportionment plan for the state in September 1965 and that their action in so doing was unconstitutional.  It is alleged that the Secretary of State would be governed by the apportionment plan, and that the Governor would cause publication of the plan, thereby causing an illegal expenditure of public funds by the state Treasurer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prayer of the petition is for a writ of prohibition and temporary restraining order &quot;preventing James A.

Pursuant to that decision the federal District Court entered an order requesting each party to actions Nos. 6082 and 6491 &quot;to file on or before October 15, 1965, suggested plans for the reapportionment of the Ohio House of Representatives and a suggested plan for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the reapportionment of the Ohio Senate, and the order further provided that any interested person or persons might within the same period of time file such suggested plans by leave.  Pursuant thereto such plans have been filed by the parties as well as by many other interested persons and organizations.  Among the plans filed by the parties is one which was filed by the Governor, Auditor of State and Secretary of State of Ohio.  Those state officials constitute the Apportionment Board created by Article XI, Section 11 of the Ohio Constitution * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States District Court noted that the reason for the submission of these suggested plans was that that court, pursuant to a mandate from the Supreme Court of the United States (378 U.S. 556), previously had declared the prior apportionment unconstitutional.  The federal District Court found that the apportionment plan submitted by the Apportionment Board did not violate the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In speaking of the Apportionment Board's plan the federal court said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is the position of said state officials, as urged in the supporting brief accompanying the plan filed in this court by the Attorney General of Ohio, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that they acted in accordance with the authority of said Section 11, thereby performing the mandatory duty imposed upon the board to reapportion the Ohio General Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is axiomatic that any action taken by a properly constituted governmental agency is entitled to a presumption of validity, and accordingly the action of the Apportionment Board is here to be presumed to be legal, valid and constitutionally taken.  (See, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">e. g., </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Goldberg </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> Truck Drivers Local Union No. 299</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 293 F. 2d 806 [6th Cir. 1961].) In this regard, mention is made of the fact that such constitutionality has been challenged in an action instituted in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, Ohio, October 20th, 1965, in action No. 8228 on the docket of that court.  Until or unless the presumption of validity hereinabove referred to is dissipated by determination by the Ohio courts, the presumption is deemed binding upon this court, the question whether the board acted in accordance with authority conferred by the Constitution of Ohio being peculiarly one of Ohio law and appropriate for resolution in the courts of that state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We regard the apportionment of the General Assembly of Ohio as being&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a legislative rather than a judicial function.  The federal court should intervene only to protect rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.  When a state apportionment has been declared unconstitutional the federal court should devise and put into effect a reapportionment plan only as a last resort when the Legislature fails or is unable to act.  In devising a plan the court acts to prevent a breakdown or disruption of essential state government services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the presumption of validity prevails and finds support in the Ohio courts, it must necessarily follow that by its action the board has established a plan for the reapportionment of the General Assembly and the only determination to be made by this court is whether or not such plan is in violation of the Constitution of the United States or any provisions thereof.  A study of such plan convinces us that the apportionment made by the board conforms as nearly as practicable according to population and follows the rules enunciated by the Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Reynolds</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  This court therefore finds that said plan is not violative of the Constitution of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, it was left to the Ohio courts to decide&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  whether the Apportionment Board acted legally under authority granted by the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals for Franklin County granted the writ, holding that the Apportionment Board had authority to meet only after each decennial period, and that, having met and acted in 1961, it had no authority to meet again until after the next decennial census.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The entry of the Franklin County Court of Appeals reads in part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Article XI of the Ohio Constitution, Sections one through eleven, prescribes the method and manner of apportionment for the Ohio House and the Ohio Senate.  By a series of federal court cases filed in the Southern District of Ohio, the apportionment of both the Ohio House of Representatives and the Ohio Senate, effected in 1961 by the Apportionment Board acting pursuant to the provisions of Article XI, was held unconstitutional as being in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and said court invalidated in whole or in part numerous sections of Article XI of the Ohio Constitution.  Said United States District Court ordered into effect an apportionment plan for Ohio for the 1966 general elections but reserved to the state courts&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the question of the validity, under the Ohio Constitution, of the action taken by the Ohio Apportionment Board in 1965 in adopting a plan for the remainder of the decennium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This court finds that the aforenamed respondents acted without authority either from the Ohio Constitution or the laws of this state in adopting and attempting to put into effect an apportionment for the remainder of the decennium, and that said apportionment is null and void.  This finding does not affect the federal court order for the 1966 elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court on direct appeal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A federal district court ruled as unconstitutional several of Ohio's apportionment provisions contained within Ohio's Constitution, including the Board's most recent apportionment. The apportionment provisions that remained in Ohio Const. art. XI mandated reapportionment every 10 years. The citizen alleged that the Board's action to adopt a new apportionment prior to expiration of the 10-year period violated Ohio Const. art. XI, &sect; 11. The court reversed the appeal's court judgment affirming the prohibition on the reapportionment. The court held that the remaining provisions in Ohio Const. art. XI, &sect;&sect; 1, 6, and 11 were severable, and thus operable, from the other sections that were found unconstitutional by the federal courts. The court then held that the Board not only had the implied power, but also a duty to act pursuant to &sect; 11 to reapportion the districts within the state into a valid apportionment, where the prior apportionment was declared a nullity. The court held that to hold otherwise would leave the state without an apportionment for legislative representative in a process that had been approved by the citizens of the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the appeals court's affirmance of the trial court's ruling that respondents were prohibited from adopting an apportionment plan under the provisions of the remaining Constitutional apportionment sections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case originated in the Lyndhurst Municipal Court, in Cuyahoga County, to recover damages allegedly sustained in a motor vehicle collision which occurred on December 27, 1963.  Plaintiff seeks a recovery of $ 10,000.  After the petition was filed, and the case was at issue, counsel for defendant made a written offer to allow judgment for the sum of $ 500, pursuant to Section 2311.17, Revised Code, on July 25, 1965.  The offer to allow judgment pursuant to Section 2311.17, Revised Code, was rejected by plaintiff on August 11, 1965.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequent to the rejection of the foregoing offer by plaintiff, a medical examination was obtained, at the request of defendant, by Dr. Byron K. Hoffman, as an incident to preparation for and trial of this action.  In addition to the foregoing expenditure, certain of the court costs assessed against plaintiff were incurred during the interval between the rejection of the offer and the trial of this action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the case was called for trial, and out of the presence of the jury, defendant renewed his offer to allow judgment for $ 500, originally made pursuant to Section 2311.17, Revised Code, and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  also made an additional offer to confess judgment for $ 500 pursuant to Section 2311.18, Revised Code.  Both offers were rejected and the case proceeded to trial with the jury returning a verdict for plaintiff for $ 500.  Following the verdict of the jury, defendant filed a motion to tax certain of his expenditures and court costs.  The motion of defendant was granted and the court taxed the items set forth in such motion as costs of this proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff appealed from the judgment assessing the costs against him to the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, where the judgment was modified by elimination of those items of costs and expenses incurred subsequent to the first written offer to allow judgment and previous to the second such offer &quot;for the reason that said items accrued after defendant's offer out of court to allow judgment was withdrawn by operation of law.  R. C., Section 2311.17.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case arose as a result of certain proposed zoning changes in Boardman Township, Mahoning County, Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellants herein, and other property owners, requested the Boardman Township Zoning Commission to rezone certain properties to a business use.  The zoning commission approved and recommended the changes.  Under the provisions of Section 519.12, Revised Code, such recommendations are then submitted to the Board of Township Trustees for adoption or rejection.  The pertinent part of Section 519.12, Revised Code, reads as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Within twenty days after such public hearing the board shall either adopt or deny the recommendations of the zoning commission or adopt some modification thereof.  In the event the board denies or modifies the recommendation of the Township Zoning Commission the unanimous vote of the board shall be required.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The township trustees held the required public hearing and then put the matter to a vote.  Two of the members voted to deny the recommendation and the third member voted to adopt it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee filed an action praying for an injunction to prevent the appellant owners and developers from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  erecting commercial buildings on the property involved and to prevent the defendant township trustees and the zoning inspector from issuing a permit for such construction.  Defendant township trustees cross-petitioned for a declaratory judgment as to the legal effect of their actions.  This prayer was then joined by all parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Common Pleas granted plaintiff the relief prayed for and issued the requested injunctions.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court agreed. The court held that voidable judgments under &sect; 2953.21 could be construed so as not to interfere with the doctrine of res judicata. None of prisoners' petitions included any allegations that would have justified an inference that the constitutional questions were not raised or could not have been raised, litigated, and adjudicated against the prisoners by the judgment of conviction or by appeals in the ordinary course.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action in quo warranto originating in this court.  In his petition, relator alleges that he is a resident of the city of Wickliffe, a public-school teacher teaching in a school outside such city, and that on November 2, 1965, he was elected to the council of such city.  He alleges further that the board of elections declared him duly elected and issued a certificate of election, and that on January 1, 1966, he took the oath of office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His qualification was questioned on the basis of the provision of the charter which reads as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No person shall serve as a member of council unless during his term of office he shall continue to be a resident and a qualified elector of the city of Wickliffe, and if elected or appointed from a ward, shall be and continue to be a resident of such ward.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">He shall not hold any other public office or public employment</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, except as otherwise provided in this chapter * * *.&quot; (Emphasis added.)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Relator teacher brought this original action in quo warranto to compel respondent city council to seat him as a member of the council. The board of elections had declared him duly elected and issued a certificate of election but the council refused to seat him on the basis of a city charter provision that forbade council members from holding public employment. The teacher filed a motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The teacher was employed in a public school outside the city. The charter provision was subsequently amended to limit the prohibition to city employment. The court noted that there was no basic inherent or constitutional right to hold public office and that legislatures could impose certain basic qualifications upon those who sought public office so long as a classification was clear, rested on some reasonable ground, and affected all persons in the class equally. The court held that a classification, though discriminatory, was not arbitrary nor violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment if any state of facts reasonably could be conceived that would sustain it. The court held that a prohibition against receiving salaries from two positions supported by public tax dollars had a valid public purpose and that the charter provision was reasonable. The court also found that City of Wickliffe, Ohio, Charter art. III, &sect; 3, which provided for the expulsion or removal of a member of council, did not apply to the teacher because he had never been seated as a member. The court further held that the amendment to the charter could not be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After David Terelli and Norman T.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereupon five of the named witnesses filed an action in prohibition in the Court of Appeals, seeking a writ to prohibit the trial judge from entering the above order in the journal.

The court found that Ohio Const. art. I, &sect;10, which concerned the taking of depositions, was not drafted to preclude a defendant from taking a deposition in a criminal action. The court found that the constitutional provision, when drafted, sought to protect the right of confrontation if the State chose to conduct a deposition in a criminal matter.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, appellant herein, a minor in his late teens, was charged by affidavit in the Painesville Municipal Court under Section 205.01 of the Ordinances of the City of Mentor with operating a motor vehicle on private property in the city of Mentor on January 31, 1965, while under the influence of intoxicating liquor -- a misdemeanor.  Upon defendant's arraignment, the court entered a plea of not guilty for him.  After several continuances, the case came on for trial without a jury on July 15, 1965.  Certain preliminary motions by counsel for defendant to correct the record and to suppress evidence on constitutional grounds were overruled, as was the demurrer to the affidavit interposed on the date of trial.  Also overruled was an oral motion by defendant on the trial date, July 15, for a jury trial.  It was the unsuccessful contention of the defendant that his apprehension and the incidents which followed were in violation of Sections 10 and 14, Article I of the Constitution of Ohio, and of the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The patrolman of the Mentor Police Department who apprehended&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant testified that, pursuant to a complaint by the pastor of a church on the Lake Shore Boulevard in the city of Mentor, he proceeded to the parking lot behind the church in the very early morning and found a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">parked</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> automobile with the motor running and the lights off.  Four persons were inside the vehicle -- defendant, a male companion and two young women.  According to the patrolman, defendant was sitting in the driver's seat behind the steering wheel.  Pursuant to the patrolman's request, defendant produced his driver's license.  His breath had an alcoholic odor, and his appearance and behavior indicated to the patrolman that defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor.  Defendant, without objection, accompanied the patrolman to the Mentor police station.  Defendant stated to the patrolman that he had been drinking and had been driving the automobile.  Upon defendant's motion, this evidence was excluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over defendant's objection, the court admitted testimony as to the results of a Breathalyzer test given defendant at the police station and as to the manner in which he performed certain physical tests, including those of co-ordination and balance.  A captain&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Mentor police force on duty at the police station when defendant entered testified concerning the odor of alcohol on defendant's breath and the faulty manner in which he performed some of the physical tests.  He testified further that in his opinion defendant &quot;was under the influence of alcohol.&quot; The Breathalyzer test given defendant showed &quot;.18 per cent.&quot; Defendant was jailed and then released under a $ 500 bond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's only witness was his male companion, who was with him when he was apprehended.  He testified that he, not the defendant, had been driving the automobile prior to parking behind the church, and that while parked the motor and lights were off.  Defendant did not testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court found defendant guilty, sentenced him to 15 days in jail, suspending 12 days of the sentence, fined him $ 100, placed him on probation for one year and deprived him of the right to drive a motor vehicle during that period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's appeal on questions of law to the Court of Appeals resulted in an affirmance of the judgment below without written opinion.  One judge dissented with a short dissenting opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now in this court for review and decision on an appeal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as of right and the allowance of the motion to require the Court of Appeals to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant sought review as of right from a decision of the Court of Appeals for Lake County (Ohio), which affirmed the judgment convicting him of the crime of operating a motor vehicle on private property while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Defendant was given a partially-suspended sentence, fined, placed on probation, and deprived of the right to drive a motor vehicle during the period of probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On review, defendant first contended that he was unconstitutionally denied a jury trial. The court initially noted that the case involved a misdemeanor offense. The court then found that because defendant failed to proffer a written request for a jury trial, as mandated by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1901.24, the trial to the court without a jury was proper. Nonetheless, the court determined that defendant was entitled to a reversal of his conviction. There was nothing to show that defendant had consumed any beverage other than beer in a moderate amount prior to the parking on the church grounds where he was subsequently arrested. Although defendant was sitting behind the steering wheel of the stationary vehicle, there was testimony that others, in fact, had been driving prior to parking the vehicle. Moreover, the evidence relating to the Breathalyzer test was incompetent and should not have been considered because the prosecutor failed to establish that the device was in proper working order before the test was given. In essence, there was nothing to establish a relationship between the time there was evidence to show the influence of intoxicants and the time of operating a vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the court of appeals' judgment affirming defendant's conviction for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause presently before this court contains no factual issues.  Rather, the only question presented is whether, as plaintiffs contend, in the amended petition for declaratory judgment, &quot; Section 5711.22(B), Revised Code [as amended effective December 9, 1963], is unconstitutional and void in that it results in an unequal burden of taxation upon taxpayers and is a denial of equal protection of law * * * contrary to the provisions of Section 2, Article I of the Constitution of Ohio and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.&quot; Simply stated, that section provides that personal property held by a merchant for sale and not for resale shall be listed for taxation for the year 1964 and assessed at 70% of the value of such property exceeding $ 100,000 and at 66% of the value of such property for the first $ 100,000.  Each successive year thereafter, the percentage of assessment on the first $ 100,000 is lowered at the rate of four per cent per year until 1968 when the rate of 50% is reached and maintained.  Throughout this period all such merchant's property exceeding a valuation of $ 100,000 continues to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be assessed at a rate of 70% of value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tax Commissioner of Ohio entered an appearance denying that such statute is unconstitutional.  Plaintiffs then moved for judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Common Pleas found that &quot;plaintiffs are entitled by law to judgment against defendant&quot; and accordingly held Section 5711.22(B), Revised Code, unconstitutional as being in violation of the Constitution of Ohio and of the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Section 5711.22(B), Revised Code, is a reasonable exercise of the taxation and exemption power vested in the General Assembly.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio) reversed the judgment of the common pleas court that held the statute unconstitutional and the taxpayers sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The statute declared that personal property held by a merchant for sale should be listed for taxation for the year 1964 and assessed at 70 percent of the value of such property exceeding $ 100,000 and at 66 percent of the value of such property for the first $ 100,000. Each successive year thereafter, the percentage of assessment on the first $ 100,000 was lowered until 1968 when the rate of 50 percent was reached. The appellate court held that the statute was a reasonable exercise of the powers vested in the legislature. The court found that the basic power of taxation stemming from Ohio Const. art. II, &sect;1 allowed personal property to be taxed at the discretion of the legislature, limited by the equal protection clause. The court also found that the Equal Protection Clause required all property within an enumerated classification that had not been lawfully exempted from taxation to be assessed and taxed at an equal rate. The court reversed and held that the statute violated equal protection because it directly imposed a different rate of assessment and, therefore, a different burden of taxation upon property within a particular class.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the appellate court judgment that ruled that the statute that provided for a graduated taxation upon merchants' inventory was constitutional.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action in mandamus originating in this court.  Relator, city of Cleveland, seeks to compel respondents to honor certain bills for the providing of electric power for the lighting of interstate highways within the boundaries of the municipality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts are as follows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the construction of interstate highways within the city of Cleveland, contracts were entered into between the director and the city, one provision of which reads as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The city agrees to make ample provisions each year for the maintenance of, and to maintain the project in a satisfactory manner, including any lighting system, traffic directional signs, and altered municipally owned utilities and sanitary sewers, and to furnish power for operation of all facilities requiring power.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The parties contracted for the City to maintain and provide electric power for the lighting of interstate highways within its boundaries. The general assembly later passed a bill requiring the Director to maintain and provide adequate lighting on interstate highways within the boundaries of municipal corporations. The City sent the Director a bill for lighting the interstate highway within its limits. The Director refused to pay it, and the City sought a writ of mandamus. The court granted the writ. The court held that the bill at issue did not impair the obligation of contracts as the state was entitled to release obligations due it. The court also held that although Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 723.01 required cities to maintain public highways within their municipal corporations, the bill did not violate Ohio Const. art. II, &sect;16(2). The court found that the bill made joint the duty to maintain such highways and did not amend Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 723.01. The court held that as no exceptions were included in the bill, the state's duty applied to those cities which had previously contracted to maintain the highways, and that those cities were relieved from their contractual obligations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeals issuing a writ of mandamus compelling appellants, members of the Board of Tax Appeals, to place upon its journal an entry placing the appellee, Merrill D. Brothers, on its payroll as a member of the Board of Tax Appeals and for further relief in connection therewith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no controversy as to the facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1959, appellee was appointed to the Board of Tax Appeals for a term ending on February 8, 1965.  He received his commission, filed his bond and took the oath of office on February 28, 1959.  On March 10, 1959, the Senate gave its advice and consent to the appointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 5, 1965, James R. Gould was appointed by the Governor for the term beginning on February 9, 1965, and ending on February 8, 1971.  On February 11, 1965, Gould took the oath of office, furnished bond and entered upon the duties of the office.  The appointment was submitted to the Senate, and on February 24 on a vote of 16 nays to 15 yeas the Senate refused to advise and consent to the appointment.  On March 17, 1965, Gould resigned the office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 7, 1965, the Governor appointed Francis&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  B. Douglass as a member of the Board of Tax Appeals for the term ending on February 8, 1971.  On April 20, 1965, Douglass received his commission, took the oath of office, filed his bond and entered upon the duties of a member of the Board of Tax Appeals.  The appointment was submitted to the Senate on April 7, 1965, and referred to the Rules Committee.  The Senate adjourned sine die on September 1, 1965, without acting on the appointment.  Appellee instituted the present action in mandamus to compel his reinstatement to the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee contends that under the provisions of Section 3.01, Revised Code, as the incumbent in office he continued therein until his successor was appointed and qualified, and that inasmuch as the Senate had not advised and consented to the appointment of either Gould or Douglass neither had qualified for the office.  Appellee argued that, therefore, he was a member of the board and entitled to perform the duties and receive the compensation therefor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals found that, where advice and consent of the Senate is required in an appointment by the Governor, the appointment is not complete until submitted to and concurred in by the Senate and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ordered a writ of mandamus issued restoring appellee to the payroll of the board.</SPAN></P>

The issue was whether under Ohio Const. art. III, &sect; 21, the incumbent was still a member of the board due to the General Assembly's failure to affirmatively consent to the appointment of his nominated replacements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The incumbent argued and the lower court agreed that the General Assembly's action in not affirmatively consenting by majority vote to the governor's nominated replacements on the Board of Tax Appeals meant that his appointment had not yet expired. The other board members disagreed and sought review. The court held that Ohio Const. art. III, &sect; 21 was controlling; based on the wording of &sect; 21 and its legislative history that lead to its passing and amendment of the state constitution, the court held that the new officials became members of the board upon their formal appointment by the governor; no other act was required. The General Assembly's sole power, the court held, was the ability to affirmatively disapprove of the existing appointment if they so wished. It was not required for the General Assembly to formally approve the appointment; all it could do was to formally and affirmatively disapprove an appointment by a majority vote. The court held that therefore the incumbent's term of office had expired and that his replacements were the new members of the board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the judgment of the lower appellate court and rendered a judgment on behalf of the board and against the incumbent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sibarco Corporation (hereinafter referred to as Sibarco) has title or contract rights to certain properties located at a point where Henry Street, Westbridge Drive, Prospect Street and West Bridge Street intersect in the city of Berea.  The land is zoned for single-family dwellings (1-A-1) and apartments or hotels (2-A).  Sibarco desires to construct a gasoline station on this land.  In order to secure favorable zoning provisions for such construction, Sibarco petitioned the Planning Commission and the Council of the city of Berea for an amendment to the zoning ordinance, but was unsuccessful.  Sibarco then formally applied for a building permit to erect a gasoline station on the above properties.  Building Commissioner McDonald denied the application.  An appeal was taken to the Board of Zoning Appeals which affirmed the commissioner's denial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sibarco, together with Walter E. Mischnick (who owned certain of the aforementioned properties to which Sibarco had a contract right of purchase), instituted an action in mandamus invoking the original jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County against the city of Berea&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and Building Commissioner McDonald, seeking an order commanding the appellants to issue the building permit to relators.  The Court of Appeals heard the case on the merits and allowed the writ to issue.  Appellants appeal, as a matter of right, to this court.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant city sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which issued a writ of mandamus commanding the city to issue building permits to relators, a group of building owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owners sought a building permit for the construction of a gasoline station on properties they already owned. The property in question was zoned for residential purposes and the city denied the permits. On review, the court reversed the appellate court's decision. The court held that a writ in mandamus must not issue, where there was a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. The court found that the appellate court exceeded the original jurisdiction conferred upon it by the Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 6 when it allowed the extraordinary writ of mandamus to issue although the owners had available a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law by way of appeal pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506. The court found that after the owners' request was denied by the city, the owners went to the executive branch of the city government and were again rejected. The owners failed to seek an appeal of the denial; rather, they petitioned for a writ of mandamus. Because &sect; 2506 provided a plain and adequate remedy for review by a trial court, the owners' mandamus petition was not a substitute for an appeal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action in quo warranto originating in this court.  Relator attacks the validity of Section 13, Article VIII of the Ohio Constitution, which provides for public aid to private corporations for the purpose of creating new employment, and Section 1724.10, Revised Code, enacted pursuant to the provisions of Section 13, Article VIII.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent, Greater Portsmouth Growth Corporation, is a corporation not for profit organized as a community improvement corporation for the purpose of advancing the economic development of Scioto County and the city of Portsmouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the provisions of Section 1724.10, Revised Code, respondent entered into agreements with Scioto County and the city of Portsmouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to a plan for the county of Scioto and a plan for the city of Portsmouth of industrial, commercial, distribution and research development and as the agent of these two political subdivisions, respondent entered into an agreement with Dayton-Portsmouth Foundry Company, a private corporation, to construct and equip an addition to an existing plant of Dayton-Portsmouth on real estate purchased from Dayton-Portsmouth and to lease back to Dayton-Portsmouth the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  real estate with the plant addition thereon.  The acquisition of the real estate and the construction and equipping of the plant addition are to be financed by the proceeds from a sale by respondent of its revenue bonds, in the principal amount of $ 400,000, to commercial banks in the city of Portsmouth.  The bonds are secured by a first mortgage on the real estate and the plant addition and the equipment and are payable solely from the revenues and other amounts derived from the leasing of the real estate and the plant addition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To further effectuate the plans of industrial, commercial, distribution and research development, respondent issued its guarantee insuring mortgage payments required by a first mortgage on a terminal and servicing operation of Yellow Cab Company, Inc., a private corporation for profit, securing a bank loan to Yellow Cab.  By its terms the guarantee is limited to the sum of $ 2,000, and the interest earned thereon, received by respondent from contributions and pledged by the guarantee.</SPAN></P>

VIII was unconstitutional because it violated the single subject requirement. The corporation filed a motion for summary judgment. The court found that the amendment had a single purpose, which was to allow the government to give financial assistance to private industry in order to create new employment within the state. Relator also argued that the description on the ballot was improper. The court found that the amendment as set forth on the ballot was a clear and concise statement of the proposed amendment. Thus, it was sufficient to inform the voters of the contents of the amendment. The court also found that exclusion of electric and gas companies did not constitute a denial of equal protection because the classification was reasonable.

The village enacted the requested zoning ordinance. Years later, the homeowners' association wanted to develop the green space and brought its actions to invalidate the zoning ordinance. On appeal, the court reversed the court of appeals. The court held that the court of appeals erred in declaring the ordinance unconstitutional when it could have resolved the appeal on non-constitutional grounds.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Norman H. Koblenz and Maxine L. Koblenz filed a complaint with the Cuyahoga County Board of Revision as to the 1963 tax assessment upon their two-and-one-half-story residence located at 3686 Normandy Road in the city of Shaker Heights, Ohio.  It is agreed that the fair market value of their property was $ 23,000 as of January 1, 1963.  The property was assessed for taxation for 1963 at the amount of $ 12,640.  The total assessed value of $ 12,640 is approximately 55% (54.95%) of the agreed fair market value of $ 23,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Koblenzes claim (1) that their home should not be assessed at a total value in excess of $ 9,000, and (2) that the assessment of their home by the county auditor was illegal because the ratio of the county auditor's valuation to the fair market value (54.95%) was greatly in excess of the prevailing average ratio of assessed value to the fair market value of residential property in Cuyahoga County, which ratio was 36%, and the ratio applicable to their home (54.95%) was also greatly in excess of the prevailing average ratio of assessed value to fair&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  market value of all real property in Cuyahoga County, which ratio was approximately 40%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah R. Goldberg filed a complaint with the Cuyahoga County Board of Revision as to the 1963 tax assessment of her store and warehouse property located at 1277 W. Sixth Street, Cleveland, Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her four-story store and warehouse building and the land upon which it was located were assessed at $ 34,640.

It is agreed by the parties that the fair market value of her property shall be considered to be $ 42,600, which was the highest appraised value submitted by witnesses for appellees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Goldberg claims (1) that her building and land should not be assessed at a total value in excess of $ 20,000, and (2) that the assessment of her land and building by the county auditor, as reduced by the Board of Revision, was illegal because the ratio of the county auditor's valuation, as reduced by the County Board of Revision, to the agreed fair market value of her property, was 78.39% (actually approximately 70%), which ratio was greatly in excess of the prevailing average ratio of assessed value to fair market value of commercial property&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in Cuyahoga County, which ratio was 52%, and the ratio applicable to her land and building was also greatly in excess of the prevailing average ratio of assessed value to fair market value of all real property in Cuyahoga County, which ratio was approximately 40%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a hearing before Edward J. Kirwin, attorney-examiner for the Board of Tax Appeals, the ratios set forth above were testified to by Edwin Ducey, Chief of the Division of County Affairs of the Board of Tax Appeals.  These ratios were not disputed in the record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board of Tax Appeals upheld the assessment of the county auditor in the Koblenz case and declined to make a further revision of the assessment in the Goldberg case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The real property parcels owned by the taxpayers were assessed for tax purposes at a higher percent of their value than other taxpayers were required to pay on their property. The taxpayers challenged the assessment, and the Board of Tax Appeals refused to further adjust one assessment and affirmed the other. The taxpayers appealed, contending that the assessments were illegal because the ratio of the county auditor's valuation to the fair market value was in excess of the prevailing average ratio of assessed value to the fair market value of other residential property, which was unconstitutional. The court agreed, holding that: (1) Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect; 2 required land and improvements to be taxed by uniform rule according to value; (2) U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 provided that no state could deny the equal protection of the laws; (3) under Ohio law, all real property, regardless of its nature or use, had to be assessed and taxed by a uniform rule on the basis of value; (4) the Board was required to correct any discriminatory valuation; and (5) the Ohio and federal constitutional requirements of uniformity and equal protection required adjustments be made to the tax assessments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio real estate was acquired in December 1963 by the appellant, The Philada Home Fund, a nonprofit Ohio corporation, hereinafter referred to as the Fund, for the stated purpose of erecting thereon apartments solely for the occupancy by &quot;aged and needy self-respecting persons of good character,&quot; couples and individuals at rentals at or below cost.  The articles of incorporation stated this purpose and provided further that it be carried out under &quot;liberal rules and regulations to be adopted by the trustees, one such regulation, however, to be that the principal and income of the Fund and all amounts received * * * in trust shall always be used exclusively for the purposes of the Fund as a purely public charity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Land acquisition cost was $ 84,000.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an appeal from the Court of Appeals for Ross County after that court had affirmed the approval of a final and distributive account by the Probate Court of Ross County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wisser &amp; Gabler, a plumbing and heating company, was a partnership with its principal office in Chillicothe, Ohio.  In late 1953, John A. Wisser, one of the partners therein, was declared an incompetent and Paul F. Ralston, one of the appellants herein, was appointed his guardian.  Shortly thereafter, Ralston filed an application in the Probate Court for dissolution of the partnership and the appointment of a receiver for the purpose of winding up, liquidation, and sale of the business.  On February 2, 1954, Merle V. Holcomb was appointed receiver.  Buckeye Union Casualty Company was Holcomb's bonding company and is an appellee in this appeal.  Holcomb was a local plumber and was granted authority to continue the operation of the business for the purpose of winding up and in so doing was required to complete existing work in progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Holcomb was appointed receiver of Wisser &amp; Gabler, there were numerous contracts which were only partially performed. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In those unfinished contracts lay the true worth of the business.  Holcomb, as per instructions, immediately went to work in an attempt to finish them.  John Burns, a public accountant, was hired.  In 1955, Burns prepared an account for the receivership, showing the receipts, disbursements, petty cash disbursements and joint check disbursements.  In January 1955, Holcomb filed an inventory and appraisement of the assets and liabilities of Wisser &amp; Gabler.  Exceptions were filed by Ralston.  On March 8, 1955, Holcomb filed an interim report of operations styled, &quot;Amended and Supplemental Inventory and Appraisement,&quot; which showed the assets and liabilities of Wisser &amp; Gabler as of February 1, 1954, and as of January 19, 1955.  Exceptions were again filed by Ralston and resulted in a hearing before a master commissioner.  As a result of this hearing, the court on December 29, 1959, determined the assets and liabilities of Wisser &amp; Gabler as of the time Holcomb was appointed the receiver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the judgment of December 29, 1959, the court sustained part of the exceptions of Ralston, overruled part of the exceptions, overruled Ralston's motion to remove Holcomb as receiver and asked Holcomb&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to file an accounting.  Holcomb did not file an accounting and was removed on November 25, 1961.  The hearings which preceded the judgment disclosed that on May 3, 1954, Holcomb, his wife and James Cutright, the attorney for both Ralston and the receiver, organized a corporation known as Scioto Plumbing &amp; Heating Company, Inc.  This company purchased the physical assets of Wisser &amp; Gabler at a price of $ 19,021.40.  The assets which were purchased actually were trucks and equipment and were appraised at approximately the value which was paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1962, Robert L. Reeb, a certified public accountant, examined for Holcomb all the original records of Wisser &amp; Gabler and of the receivership.  Reeb made inquiry with various banks, creditors and debtors of Wisser &amp; Gabler.  As a result of Reeb's work, a final and distributive account was filed by Holcomb showing every receipt by Holcomb of assets of the receivership and every disbursement made by him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exceptions were again filed by Ralston, E. A. Moats, the successor receiver, and W. E. Caldwell Company, a creditor.  After a four-day hearing on these exceptions, the Probate Court determined that Holcomb's account was accurate.  Based on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this determination, the court approved the account and discharged Holcomb and his bonding company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An appeal was taken from the above ruling to the Court of Appeals for Ross County.  The appeal was one on questions of law and fact.  Such appeal was dismissed on questions of law and fact and retained on questions of law.  The unconstitutionality of appeals on questions of law and fact was the reason given by the Court of Appeals for its decision to dismiss the appeal on questions of law and fact.  </SPAN></P>

After the account was filed, the probate court determined that the receiver's account was accurate. An appeal was dismissed on questions of law and fact but retained on questions of law. The court affirmed and held that a holding in favor of the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2501.02, 2505.21 was consistent with the established rules for statutory and constitutional interpretation. It was clear that the appointment of the receiver was not in issue. Thus, an appeal on questions of law and fact under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2501.02(4) was not proper. The court found that the court of appeals properly only considered the issue of whether the final and distributive account of the receiver was complete and accurate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tax Commissioner of Ohio confirmed, as modified, certain deficiency sales and use tax assessments theretofore made against the two appellees herein, The Celina Mutual Insurance Company and The National Mutual Insurance Company, domestic insurance companies, over the audit period from January 1, 1958, to June 30, 1961, and covering manuals and replacement sheets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellees were and are engaged in the business of writing and selling fire, casualty and other related lines of insurance.  Under the laws of Ohio, they are required to file with the Department of Insurance for approval copies of the rules and rates appertaining to their business, represented by manuals and often in loose-leaf form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would appear from the records that none of the manuals or manual sheets are delivered to an insured, nor are they usually attached to an insurance policy.  Rather they are for reference and guidance for the insurance companies and their agents in writing policies and fixing premium rates.  Although referred to therein, they are separate from the policies themselves and are not sold or resold to anyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The manuals and replacement sheets&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in issue were purchased by appellees without the payment of sales or use taxes on such purchases, and the Tax Commissioner found that such purchases were subject to such taxes, and he made assessments accordingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellees, being dissatisfied with the Tax Commissioner's final orders, perfected appeals to the Board of Tax Appeals, where the orders of the Tax Commissioner were affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further appeals to the Court of Appeals for Mercer County, as authorized by statute, resulted in each case in a reversal of the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals as unreasonable and unlawful, largely on the commutation provisions of Section 5725.25, Revised Code, and final judgments for the insurance companies were rendered.</SPAN></P>

The commissioner contended that the interpretation given Ohio Rev.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This proceeding originated in the Probate Court of Hamilton County on exceptions of the Tax Commissioner to an order of that court determining inheritance or succession tax in the estate of Emily Woodall Laffoon who was a resident of Ohio at her death.  In 1927, decedent's husband, Polk Laffoon, who predeceased her and who was never a resident of or domiciled in Ohio, irrevocably conveyed in Kentucky certain assets to a Kentucky bank as trustee.  In the instrument declaring the trust the settlor provided that the income from the trust was to be paid to his wife until their two children reached certain ages.  When their daughter reached 25 (she did in 1941), the income from one-half of the trust was to be paid to the daughter.  When their son reached 25 (he did in 1944), the income from the other half was to be paid to the son.  When the son reached 35, he was to be entitled to his one-half of the principal.  On the death of the daughter, her one-half of the principal was to be distributed to her issue.  There were other provisions for distribution in the event of death of the son before 35 or death of the daughter without issue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The trust instrument provided further in part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donor grants to his wife, Emily Woodall Laffoon, the power to modify this trust at any time so as to provide for any child or children of donor hereafter born, or to change the proportions, amounts and times of payment to the beneficiaries named above or their issue, but no such modification shall provide for the payment of any income or principal to donor.  Such modification shall be in writing signed by donor's said wife, and delivered to the trustee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1941, when the daughter became 25, the decedent, as donee of the foregoing power, exercised that power by specifying in writing that the income from the trust be paid to her, the decedent, for life.  In 1956, she again exercised that power by specifying in writing that, on her death, her son was to receive four-fifths, if then living, and the children of her then deceased daughter were to receive one-fifth of the trust estate with other provisions for disposition of those shares in the event of deaths prior to death of the donee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the trust assets are intangibles having no claimed relationship to Ohio and it does not appear that any of the evidences thereof are located in Ohio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Tax Commissioner contends that because the donee was a resident of Ohio both at her death and at the time she exercised the power of appointment the successions to the trust assets are taxable under those portions of Section 5731.02, Revised Code, which reads:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A tax is hereby levied upon the succession to any property passing * * * to or for the use of a person * * * in the following cases:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The decedent was a resident of Ohio at the time of her death. The decedent's husband, who predeceased her and was never a resident of Ohio, created a power of appointment over intangible property by a trust set up outside Ohio. The decedent, as the donee of the power, had no authority to appoint any part of the property to herself or to her estate and the power was to be exercised only inter vivos by a modification of the trust. The tax commissioner argued that, because the decedent was a resident of Ohio both at her death and at the time she exercised the power of appointment, the successions to the trust assets were taxable under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5731.02. The lower court affirmed the probate court's determination that no part of the trust should be treated as a taxable succession. The court affirmed, finding that the state had no power to tax the succession to property located outside the state where no incident whatever of the transfer of title to such property was in any way dependent for its effect upon the law of the taxing state and finding that to permit such a tax would be to give extraterritorial effect to the state's taxing statutes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 27, 1961, appellee The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company applied to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio for authority to raise its rates for steam and hot-water service supplied to users in the city of Cleveland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After hearing, the commission, on January 8, 1963, found that the existing rates being charged are insufficient to provide the company with an adequate return; that the statutory rate base is $ 19,261,306; that an annual return of 3.53% is not unreasonable or unjust; that the annual dollar return to which the company is entitled is $ 680,311.11; that the allowable annual expenses aggregate $ 3,343,657.08; that the allowable annual revenue to which applicant is entitled is $ 4,023,968.19; and that the amendment to the fuel adjustment clause of the application was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An understanding of the matters involved herein will be assisted by reference to the following schematic diagram of the pertinent portion of the subdivision plat of Bellaire Allotment No. 2 in Lot 53, Bath Township, Summit County, Ohio, which plat was recorded in 1952.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[SEE ILLUSTRATION IN ORIGINAL]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellees O'Neil and Gaffney purchased lots 21 and 22 in 1958 and 1960 respectively and each constructed residences thereon.  Lot 21A is unimproved and is described on the recorded plat as not a building lot but &quot;may be used for future streets or may be used as additions to adjacent building lots.&quot; There is no evidence that it has ever been accepted for public use by any proper authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, there is evidence to show that in the ordinary course of events lot 21A would have been a part of the street system of the subdivision but for a fortuitous circumstance.  The plat was approved for recording over the signatures of two officers of the Summit County Planning Commission, contrary to a prior resolution of that body approving a tentative plat on the specific condition that the parcel now shown as lot 21A be offered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  unequivocally for dedication as a street to provide access to the adjoining undeveloped property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That the error is now recognized by the planning commission but remains unexplained is revealed by the following excerpt from its minutes of April 26, 1963:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Surveyor Swigart presented Bellaire No. 2 Allotment which was recorded in 1957.  The preliminary plat presented in 1955 was accepted, subject to street reservations to the neighboring properties.  There were road reservations at the time of the recording, but on the plat, the restrictions indicated that the road reservation could be purchased as part of adjoining lots.  The lots are now purchased and there is no way to get to the adjoining property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was moved by Alexander; seconded by Oser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That the Summit County Planning Commission wants to express the fact that the planning commission's intent was that those lots were reserved for future road at the time this plat was submitted and request the county commissioners appropriate this road, if necessary, at the cost of the developers of the adjacent land.  Mr. Alexander said the trustees or planning commission didn't know a thing about this at that time, and now referred to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  county commissioners.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c18"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;Motion carried unanimously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 1963, appellees jointly purchased lot 21A from the original subdivider.  Thereafter, appellant Hamlin acquired the 60 acres of undeveloped land to the south for future development as a subdivision.  Hamlin's tract extends to an existing public road on its southern boundary but the terrain on that portion is such that any access street would necessarily be on a grade in excess of the maximum permitted by the regulations governing construction and acceptance of streets by Summit County.  In addition, lot 21A is the only access which would not place unreasonable burdens on public authorities in furnishing utility services, street maintenance and fire and police protection to future users of the tract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unable to obtain lot 21A by purchase from O'Neil and Gaffney, Hamlin petitioned the Board of County Commissioners of Summit County (Board) under Sections 5553.41 to 5553.43, inclusive, Revised Code, to establish a public road over lot 21A.  In his petition, he agreed to improve that parcel in accordance with the construction standards of Summit County and at his cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After extensive hearings, the board found &quot;that the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  road petitioned for will serve the public convenience and welfare and that said road * * * is established on and over lot 21A&quot; and awarded the total amount of $ 2,500 to the appellees for the taking and damages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case No. 38836 began as two appeals to the Court of Common Pleas of Summit County under the provisions of Section 2506.01 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Revised Code, from the separate decisions of the board granting the petition for the road (by O'Neil and Gaffney) and awarding compensation (by Hamlin).  The appeals were consolidated in that court and proceeded as one case, whereupon the court affirmed both decisions of the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From this judgment, O'Neil and Gaffney appealed on questions of law to the Court of Appeals which reversed &quot;the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> findings, judgment and order of the Common Pleas Court&quot; and denied the petition of Hamlin to obtain a road right-of-way over the real estate of O'Neil and Gaffney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An appeal by the board of county commissioners and a cross-appeal by Hamlin were perfected to this court, which granted the motions to certify the record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case No. 38835 originated in the Common Pleas Court of Summit County on June 10, 1963, by appellees O'Neil and Gaffney, who&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  filed their petition seeking an injunction against the board to restrain it from proceeding in the matters involved in Case No. 38836.  That court refused the injunction, and plaintiffs appealed on questions of law to the Court of Appeals, which &quot;permanently enjoined [the board] from proceeding to open a public road over said lot 21A and from pursuing further actions or proceedings to effect the same based upon the petition of Richard M. Hamlin as filed with it [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] on June 3, 1963.&quot; We allowed a motion to certify the record upon the further appeal of the board to this court.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants, Board of County Commissioners of Summit County and property owner, sought review of the decision of the Court of Appeals for Summit County (Ohio), which denied the property owner's petition to obtain a road right-of-way over the real estate owned by appellee lot owners and denied the lot owners' petition for a permanent injunction to enjoin the Board from proceeding to open a public road over the real property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The property owner wanted a road right-of-way because he allegedly planned to develop a subdivision on his property and without the road right-of-way, his property was landlocked. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the appellate court to deny the petition for the road right-of-way and reversed the decision regarding the permanent injunction. The court reasoned that the use for which the eminent domain power was exercised must be public and not private and the immediate result of the granting of the road right-of-way would have been to furnish an individual access from an undeveloped tract of property to a public street. The court reasoned that if the property owner's commitment to develop his land was more definite, the decision would have been different. The court found that reversal of the injunction decision was proper because no bill of exceptions was filed in this matter, which was joined with the property owner's petition. Therefore, the court found that the appellate court had no authority other than to dismiss the appeal and to remand the cause to the lower court for a trial of the issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jack Thompson, plaintiff, appellee herein, brought this action in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County, wherein he seeks a declaratory judgment as to his rights and duties in respect to the payment of municipal income taxes to the city of Cincinnati, defendant-appellee herein, and defendant city of Loveland, appellant herein, by virtue of income tax ordinances enacted and enforced by both cities against plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff, Thompson, is a resident of the city of Loveland.  He is employed by the Cincinnati Union Terminal Company in the city of Cincinnati and, as a result of work and labor performed within the boundaries of Cincinnati, Ohio, receives income from the Cincinnati Union Terminal Company.  During the period of January 1, 1963, to December 1, 1963, plaintiff has been taxed at the rate of one per cent upon his wages under both the city of Cincinnati income tax ordinance (No. 4271961) and the city of Loveland income tax ordinance (No. 196233), for a total of two per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Common Pleas Court of Hamilton County held that the defendant city of Cincinnati had the right to collect an income tax of one per cent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  upon the wages of plaintiff, and that defendant city of Loveland had no authority to levy or collect from plaintiff any income tax upon his salary earned by him while working in the city of Cincinnati.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed, holding that there was no constitutional provision or statute depriving his residential city of the power to tax incomes of its residents where such residents were also subject to an income tax by another municipality. Indeed, the General Assembly refused to enact a provision that would have obligated all municipalities to allow a tax deduction for income tax paid by a resident of a municipality on wages earned outside a municipality. Furthermore, because the taxpayer received benefits from both cities, he was not discriminated against by the taxation.</SPAN></P>

A majority of the court determined that the certificates were lawful and denied the citizen's writ. Some of the court argued that the certificates were unlawful because they were due and payable at a date later than two years. However, the writ was denied because the issues raised by the relator appeared to be moot. The legislature enacted legislation, which extended the use of appropriations at the request of the Director of Highways. Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 129.42 appropriated such funds to the Board. Furthermore, the court noted that the money had already been extended. It was not the function of the writ of mandamus to correct errors made by public officers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Huron County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James L. Price, plaintiff, appellant herein, brought this action against the McCoy Sales &amp; Service, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as McCoy), and Charles W. Chase, defendants, appellees herein, in the Court of Common Pleas of Huron County to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been suffered by Price in a motor vehicle collision on the Ohio Turnpike at about 1:30 a.m. on May 2, 1959.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Price, with a passenger, was driving westerly on the turnpike when the motor of his automobile ceased to function.  The car was pushed over on the north berm of the highway, headed west.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In about ten or fifteen minutes, an employee of McCoy, one Sanders, arrived driving a &quot;wrecker.&quot; He was unable to give any meaningful assistance at the time as he was on his way to another call.  However, he did call McCoy's office and reported the position of Price's car and his misfortune.  Another McCoy &quot;tow-truck&quot; arrived at the scene in response to Sanders' call.  The driver, David Bundschuh, was inexperienced in this type of work and was in substance undergoing a training course.  He determined to hook his truck onto the east end, or rear, of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Price's car, execute a U-turn and then proceed westerly with the tow.  Bundschuh had never performed this type of operation before.  He was required to wait six or seven minutes before the flow of traffic permitted him to begin his proposed U-turn.  He knew that this maneuver would block the westbound traffic lanes of the turnpike for more than one minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Price, with his passenger, got into his car.  Sanders returned from his other call and assisted Bundschuh with the hookup.  Prior to moving Price's automobile, the two employees of McCoy tied the steering wheel and the left front door of the automobile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As McCoy's tow truck had almost crossed the westbound highway going from the north side to the south side, Bundschuh, driver of the tow truck, found that there was not space to clear the south guardrail of the turnpike to complete the U-turn, and that it would be necessary to back up both vehicles in order to execute the turn.  At that time, the two vehicles completely blocked the westbound lanes of the turnpike.  The tow truck did not have any equipment which would direct light towards approaching traffic when the tow truck was perpendicular to the westbound lane of travel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  few seconds later, and while the vehicles were still stationary and blocking the entire highway, Bundschuh saw Chase's car approaching from the east.  The truck was equipped with warning devices such as fusees and reflectors, but neither of the employees of McCoy displayed such devices on or about the vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chase, traveling at a speed of 60 to 65 miles an hour, did not see the standing vehicles until they were illuminated by his headlights.  He applied the brakes and slowed the speed of his car, but nevertheless it struck Price's automobile.  The collision occurred on the west side or face of a downhill incline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the taking of testimony, the court instructed the jury that Chase was guilty of negligence as a matter of law but left the determination of the question of proximate cause to the jury.  The jury returned a unanimous verdict in the amount of $ 10,000 against McCoy alone, there being no finding against Chase.  Judgment was entered on the verdict.  McCoy's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was overruled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 3, 1963, the trial court sustained McCoy's motion for a new trial, stating, as follows, the reason in its entry, pursuant to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the provisions of Section 2321.17 of the Revised Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(1) The final judgment is contrary to law, and the jury, in determining the issues failed to properly apply the law to the facts and came to an unwarranted conclusion in rendering its verdict;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(2) Error of law occurring at the trial in that the court should have declared defendant Chase's negligence a proximate cause of the injury;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(3) Reasonable minds could only have concluded that defendant Chase's negligence was a proximate cause of plaintiff's damages;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(4) Such unreasonable conclusions prejudiced the defendant McCoy Sales &amp; Service, Inc.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Price perfected his appeal to the Court of Appeals for Huron County, which found that there was no abuse discretion by the trial court in granting the motion of McCoy for a new trial, held that the granting of the new trial was not a final appealable order and dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allowance of Price's motion for an order to certify the record brings the cause before this court for review.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The driver's vehicle collided with the motorist's car, which was being towed by the company. In later suit, the jury was instructed that the driver was negligent as a matter of a law, but was allowed to determine the issue of proximate cause. The jury returned a verdict against the company alone. After entering a judgment on the verdict and denying the company's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the trial court granted the company's new trial motion, stating that the jury erred in not finding that the driver's negligence was the proximate cause of injury. The court of appeals, although finding no abuse of discretion in the granting of the motion, held that the granting of a new trial motion was not a final appealable order. On review, the court reversed and remanded for reinstatement of the judgment for the motorist, holding, inter alia, that the trial court's order granting the new trial motion was a final appealable order. Further, the court noted that the injuries resulted from the acts both defendants and that either could have been held responsible. Thus, no error resulted from the jury's finding that the company's negligence was the proximate cause of injury.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denison University filed three applications for exemption from taxation.  The first relates to three parcels of land comprising a farm of 127 plus acres upon which are located certain buildings.  This land is separated from the college campus only by a state highway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The buildings on this land are a carpenter shop used for maintenance and repair of university equipment and buildings, a lumber storage shed for storing lumber for use in the carpenter shop, a quonset hut used by university painting crews for painting college equipment and by the university for storage of maintenance equipment, and a frame dwelling lived in by a caretaker of the facilities and his family.  A riding ring and trail on this farm are used in a women's physical education course in horseback riding.  A pole shelter is used to store hay for the horses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second application relates to the president's home located upon the college campus where the president and his family live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third application relates to Middleton House and the eight-acre tract upon which it is located about one and a half miles from the campus.  Middleton House is used to provide lodging for official&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  guests of the university, such as speakers, lecturers and examiners, and for college conferences and seminars.  A caretaker and his family live in part of the house.  No income is derived from the premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By its decision, the Board of Tax Appeals denied all three applications.  The cause is now before this court on appeal from that decision.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant university challenged a decision of appellee Board of Tax Appeals (Ohio), which denied its applications seeking exemption from taxation under Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The university was a private institution of learning. It was argued that &sect; 5709.07 was inapplicable because the university was not a public college. The court held that under &sect; 5709.07 all lands connected with public institutions of learning not used with a view to profit were exempt. The buildings connected with the university were specifically exempted from taxation by &sect; 5709.07. They were with reasonable certainty used in furthering or carrying out its necessary objects and purposes. The land not occupied by buildings and connected with the university was also exempted from taxation if not used with a view to profit. The record as to the use of the building and land required their exemption from taxation. There was evidence that the land had been rented and that a farmer had harvested crops therefrom. There was no evidence to indicate what, if any, payment the university received or whether it merely allowed the use of the land to keep it in reasonably good condition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the decision denying the university's applications to exempt certain property from taxation and remanded the cause with directions to allow the tax exemptions sought.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action was instituted for the purpose of securing a declaration that the fair housing ordinance of the city of Oberlin is unconstitutional and for an injunction restraining its enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under that ordinance, a &quot;dwelling unit&quot; is defined as meaning &quot;(1) a single room, suite of rooms, or an apartment or a dwelling, occupied or intended for occupancy as separate living quarters, by an individual, by a family or a group of individuals living together or (2) a parcel of real property or a lot available for the construction of [such] a dwelling unit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ordinance makes it a crime, punishable by a fine of not more than $ 100, for an owner of five or more dwelling units in Oberlin &quot;to discriminate against any person purely because of race, creed or color, in&quot; the sale, rental or other disposition of one of those dwelling units or &quot;in the terms, conditions or privileges&quot; of such sale, rental or other disposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, the ordinance not only makes it a crime for any real estate broker, salesman or lending institution to participate in such discrimination with such an owner, but (because of the definitions for such broker, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  salesman and institution) the ordinance in effect prohibits such discrimination by such broker, salesman or institution with respect to any real estate transaction in Oberlin.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant city appealed a judgment that held the fair housing ordinance that prohibited discrimination by owners of five or more dwellings and their real estate brokers was unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement. The Court of Appeals (Ohio) reversed finding that the ordinance was constitutional, and so dismissed plaintiff taxpayer's complaint. The court certified the issues to the Ohio Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer had standing to challenge the validity of the city's fair housing ordinance because under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 733.59 and 733.56, the expenditure of public funds was necessary to enforce the ordinance. The ordinance did not constitute an unreasonable deprivation of individual property rights and contract rights in violation of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1 and 19, because it supported the right to acquire and possess property. Further any limitation imposed on an owner was constitutional as it enforced &sect; 1 which declared all men free and independent with the inalienable right to acquire and possess property. Therefore, the ordinance as an exercise of police power was substantially related to the benefit of the general welfare of the public. The equal protection clauses of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2, were not violated by the ordinance's application to owners of five or more dwellings because such owners posed potentially more of a discrimination threat than those with less than five dwellings, and other provisions discouraged owners with fewer dwellings from discrimination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the portion of the judgment that found the ordinance constitutional as to its enforcement provision, but otherwise affirmed the constitutionality of the remainder of the ordinance as a valid exercise of the city's police power to stop discrimination in housing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 11 p.m. on June 28, 1963, the Norwood Police were called about a break-in at a laundromat.  On arrival at the laundromat, they found that several money containers had been broken and some had apparently been taken.  The police were then advised that several individuals had been seen breaking into these coin boxes and they were given the descriptions of those individuals and of their get-away car and the license number of that automobile.  Shortly thereafter, that automobile was located nearby while it was being backed out of defendant's driveway by defendant.  Defendant and the four other occupants of the car were searched and arrested.  At that time, a machete knife, which was on the floor of the back seat and was clearly visible from outside the vehicle, was seen by a police officer.  Thereafter, defendant and his four companions were taken to the police station.  After they had been taken to the police station, their automobile was taken to the police station where it was searched.  While driving the automobile to the police station, the foot of the officer who was driving hit a steel object which he then determined was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a revolver.  It turned out to be a .38 caliber revolver.  After reaching the police station, the automobile was searched.  As a result of this search, which was made without a warrant, a chain was discovered under the front seat cushion, hacksaw blades and tin snips were discovered on the floorboards behind the front seat and &quot;home-made knuckles&quot; were found in the glove compartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grand jury returned an indictment charging that defendant &quot;unlawfully did carry concealed on or about his person a dangerous weapon, to wit: a .38 calibre [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] revolver and one home-made knuckles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant pleaded not guilty and filed a pretrial motion to suppress as evidence all the items found in defendant's automobile.  This motion was overruled.  All the items found in the automobile were, over defendant's objection, introduced into evidence against him and defendant was found guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of conviction.  The cause is now before this court on appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  </SPAN></P>

A machete was in plain view inside defendant's car. Defendant was transported to the police station. A police officer said that his foot hit a gun on the floor of defendant's car while he was driving it to the station. Upon later search, various tools and objects were found, including home-made &quot;knuckles,&quot; all of which was admitted into evidence against defendant. Defendant was convicted of carrying a concealed weapon and appealed, challenging the search. The appellate court affirmed the trial court, and the court affirmed the appellate court. The court acknowledged that the items other than the machete and the gun should have been suppressed in accordance with U.S. Supreme Court case law. The court said, however, that the machete and gun were not discovered through an unreasonable search. The machete was visible at the time of arrest and the gun was found while the officer lawfully transported the car. The court concluded that the other items did not prejudice defendant as he could have been convicted of violating Ohio Rev.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is before this court upon the mandate of the Supreme Court of the United States issued on June 22, 1964, after defendant petitioned it for a writ of certiorari ordering this court to consider its judgment dismissing defendant's appeal as a matter of right for the reason that there was no debatable constitutional question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, Joseph T. McLeod, along with two others, was indicted on October 3, 1960, for murder in the first degree.  On October 11, 1960, before he procured or was assigned counsel, defendant voluntarily made an oral confession in the presence of a deputy sheriff and an assistant prosecuting attorney while riding around in the sheriff's automobile searching for the gun used in the holdup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury trial was had in the Court of Common Pleas of Summit County.  Over defendant's objection, testimony by the deputy sheriff as to the oral confession was admitted into evidence.  Defendant was found guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment in the Ohio Penitentiary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of the confession, the defendant was not represented by counsel nor had he even requested counsel.  Admittedly, every procedural&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  requirement of the state of Ohio was complied with from the time of arrest to the time of sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, and an appeal to this court was dismissed for the reason that there was no debatable constitutional question involved.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> McLeod,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 173 Ohio St., 520.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal was then taken to the Supreme Court of the United States, which vacated the judgment and remanded the cause to this court ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">McLeod </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> Ohio,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 84 S.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Court of Appeals for Summit County (Ohio), which affirmed his murder conviction. At issue was the admissibility of defendant's voluntary oral confession to law enforcement officials, which was made before counsel was requested by or appointed to defendant. Defendant's appeal was before the court, after its initial dismissal, for consideration in light of a recent United States Supreme Court ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Statements made in the recent U.S. Supreme Court case were made voluntarily by that defendant but were elicited by an accomplice who had agreed to co-operate with the government. At the time that defendant made the statements, he had no knowledge that the conversation was being overheard by a government agent and would be used against him at his trial. In this defendant's case, however, the court found that defendant's statements, though made at a time when he had no counsel, were made willingly in the known presence of public officers. His incriminating statements were made while he was voluntarily endeavoring to aid the police in securing evidence of the crime. In the instant case, defendant had not yet been arraigned and the court held that the circumstances under which his incriminating statements were given were wholly different from those in the U.S. Supreme Court case. The court therefore found no reason not to affirm the appellate court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">While living in California with his wife, the decedent acquired certain shares of stock. At the time of his passing, the decedent and his wife resided in Ohio. Appellee executor determined that one-half of the stock was the outright property of his wife under California's community property law and that no tax was due on that interest. The probate and appellate courts upheld that contention. The tax commissioner sought review of the appellate court's judgment. With regard to their community property, Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 161a provided that a husband and wife possessed equal interests that were under his management. Under &sect; 161a, a wife did not have genuine control over her interest in the property. Moreover, the transaction from a partial and qualified ownership to total ownership was universally considered a taxable succession. Therefore, the wife's acquisition of the complete enjoyment of her interest in the decedent's stock was taxable under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5731.02(E), which provided that a taxable succession to the extent of one-half of the property's value occurred whenever a spouse obtained the right to the full and complete enjoyment of the property as a whole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the appellate court's judgment. The matter was remanded to the probate court for further proceedings in accordance with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the September 1961 term of the Court of Common Pleas, the Grand Jury of Columbiana County returned indictments in these causes under the provisions of Section 2915.11, Revised Code.  The appellants filed timely motions to quash the indictments on the ground that there was a &quot;defect apparent upon the face of the record.&quot; The Court of Common Pleas overruled these motions to quash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereupon appellants demurred to the indictments, contending that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) Each of the indictments violates the due process clause of Section 1, Article XIV, Amendments, Constitution of the United States, and the due-course-of-law clause of Section 16, Article I of the Constitution of the state of Ohio; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) the facts stated in the indictments do not show an offense punishable by the laws of the state of Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Common Pleas sustained appellants' demurrers to the indictments upon the ground that &quot; Section 2915.11 of the Revised Code as amended, effective September 1, 1961, as it applies to manufacturers and printers, is unconstitutional for the reason that said section does not require that the manufacturing and printing be done </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">with</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> a knowledge or intent</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the article manufactured or printed is to be used in the numbers game.&quot; (Emphasis added.)</SPAN></P>

The court noted that for over 150 years the people of Ohio had declared, through Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 6, that lotteries, and the sale of lottery tickets, for any purpose whatever, was to forever be prohibited in the State. The court found that the language of the indictment in its terms descriptive of the offense, in substance, alleged knowledge.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If any such advertising device has not been removed on or before the expiration of 30 days following the receipt of the said notice by the owner or lessee of the land upon which the advertising device is located, the Director of Highways, or any of his duly authorized agents, may, at his discretion, either:</SPAN></P>

Both parties appealed. Appellants claimed the statutes took private property without compensation in violation of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 16 and 19 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court reversed judgment. It concluded the statutes bore a real and substantial relationship to the public safety and general welfare. A statute was neither unreasonable nor arbitrary because it prohibited signs which advertised a product not sold on the property but permitted signs advertising products sold on the property. The statutes were valid and constitutional in their general application.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action in prohibition was originally instituted in the Court of Appeals for Lorain County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Helen C. Ely, appellee, is cotrustee and beneficiary under the testamentary trust of William A. Ely, deceased, filed in the Probate Court of Lorain County.  She filed a motion in such court to remove as cotrustee the First National Bank of Elyria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The probate judge of Lorain County disqualified himself from hearing the motion and requested the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to assign another judge to hear and dispose of the issues raised by such motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chief Justice assigned a judge of the Court of Common Pleas of another county to hear the matter, but, after a pretrial conference, he, too, disqualified himself and asked the Chief Justice to assign another judge to hear and determine the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About this time, the cotrustee bank filed a motion to remove the appellee as cotrustee, and appellee amended her original motion to remove the bank as cotrustee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chief Justice then assigned the appellant, Myron T. Brenneman, the duly elected, qualified and acting probate judge of Wayne County, to sit as probate judge in Lorain&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  County to pass upon the above-mentioned motions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chief Justice in making this assignment acted under the provisions of Section 2101.39, Revised Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant, sitting in Lorain County, proceeded to hear the motions, recessed the hearing and later resumed the hearing.  After several days of trial, the hearing was again recessed in order to permit the parties to enter into settlement negotiations.  A settlement was reached, the appellant was advised of this development by telephone, and he indicated that he would return to Lorain County the following Monday to make appropriate orders to perfect the settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, upon convening court the following Monday, appellant announced that he would not consider a settlement and that he proposed to cause an examination to be made of the assets of the trust, and he entered certain orders on matters not arising from the hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee then filed a motion to remove appellant as presiding judge, contending that appellant did not have jurisdiction to sit as a probate judge in Lorain County, as the statute under which he had been assigned offends the Constitution of Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant overruled this motion, whereupon appellee filed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a petition for a writ of prohibition in the Court of Appeals on July 8, 1963.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals held that the statute,&nbsp;Section 2101.39, Revised Code, was contrary to the provisions of the Constitution of Ohio and allowed a writ of prohibition to issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  </SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2101.39, which permitted the Chief Justice to appoint a probate judge of another county to replace a disqualified probate court judge, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trustee and a bank sought in the probate court to remove each other as cotrustees of a trust. The judge was the probate judge of another county. He was the second judge appointed by the Chief Justice to hear the case after the county probate judge disqualified himself from hearing the case. The trustee filed an original action in prohibition in the Court of Appeals, alleging that the judge did not have jurisdiction to hear the case. The court held that &sect; 2101.39 was presumed constitutional. Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 8, conferred such jurisdiction on probate court judges in other counties as might be provided by law. The court termed this migratory jurisdiction. The legislature had conferred jurisdiction on probate judges to hear and decide matters in a number of areas outside of traditional probate court jurisdiction. Section 2101.39 was not violative of the Constitution beyond a reasonable doubt. There was no clear incompatibility between the Constitution and the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant taxpayer sought review of the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals (Ohio), which affirmed an order of appellee Tax Commissioner imposing a sales tax assessment against the taxpayer in connection with the operation of the taxpayer's retail business. The tax was assessed pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5739.01(L) on food purchased for human consumption where the food was consumed at the place of purchase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer operated a drive-in retail soft ice-cream and soft-drink business. Customers purchased items from a building, which was surrounded by a parking area, and a number of the taxpayer's customers would consume their purchases on the taxpayer's property, but away from the actual building. The Commissioner determined that 37 percent of the products sold by the taxpayer were consumed by the purchasers in the taxpayer's parking lot and assessed a sales tax on those purchases under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5739.01(L). The assessment was affirmed by the Board. The taxpayer contended that &sect; 5739.01(L) was an unconstitutional violation of Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect; 12, which exempted from sales tax food purchases that were taken away from the place of purchase for consumption to homes and other establishments. The court held that &sect; 5739.01(L) represented a permissible legislative interpretation and application of the indefinite constitutional phrase &quot;off the premises where sold&quot; to meet modern merchandising practices. The court held that &sect; 5739.01 was not unconstitutional and that the decision of the Board affirming the Commissioner's assessment was not unreasonable or unlawful.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Brooklyn Planning Commission refused to approve relator's application for a certificate of occupancy and other permits necessary to enable relator to make a certain storeroom ready for occupancy and to use it as a restaurant in which to serve food and intoxicating liquor, upon finding that relator did not provide adequate parking space for the operation of his contemplated business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Brooklyn Board of Zoning Appeals, on appeal, affirmed the decision of the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order of the board was appealed from to the respondent Court of Common Pleas pursuant to Chapter 2506, Revised Code.  The court found that the decision of the commission was based on Section 4 (E) of the zoning ordinance, relating to parking facilities, and that the section was invalid.  The court found also that relator had a D-5 liquor permit, that there was a valid city ordinance (No. 1956.74) relating to off-street parking for places selling intoxicating liquor for consumption on the premises, and that the cause should be remanded to the Board of Zoning Appeals with instruction to enter an order referring the matter to the planning commission for specific finding of facts and a final&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  order granting or denying the permits after considering all applicable valid ordinances and statutes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this action in mandamus, brought originally in this court, the Davis Investment Company, an Ohio corporation, is the relator, and the city of Columbus and Raymond D. Goller, Superintendent of Building Regulations of that city, are the respondents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the court are the petition, the answer (a demurrer to which was overruled without written opinion), the reply and an agreed statement of facts which was submitted at the time the court had before it for disposition the demurrer to the answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversy revolves around the westerly 7.3 acres of a 17-acre tract of land owned by the relator, designated as the Berwick Manor Shoppers Mart Tract and situated in the easterly section of the city of Columbus, along the south side of East Livingston Avenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator acquired the entire 17 acres for the purpose of constructing a shopping center with accessory facilities.  By city zoning ordinances passed in 1956 and 1957, the easterly 10 acres of relator's land was classified as C-4 (a commercial district), and the westerly 7 acres plus was classified as SR (a suburban residential district).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November of 1959, relator applied for and was granted a building permit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for the construction of units of the proposed shopping center on its easterly 10 acres.  In March of 1960, application was made for a building permit to construct units of the shopping center on the westerly 7.3 acres, which was refused by the Superintendent of Building Regulations on the ground that the SR classification of that acreage precluded the granting of the permit.  An appeal from such refusal was taken to the Board of Zoning Adjustment, and at the same time and pursuant to Section 3309.06 (b) of the Columbus City Codes, then in effect, relator asked for a variance in the SR classification of the 7.3 acres to permit construction of units of the shopping center.  The appeal and the application for the variance came on for hearing before the board upon evidence pro and con and upon exhibits.  No decision was made, and the matter was continued until May 20, 1960, for further consideration upon additional information and evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 16, 1960, the Columbus City Council adopted as an emergency measure without notice Ordinance No. 618-60, designed to amend Section 3309.06 of the Columbus City Codes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 20, 1960, relator's appeal and application for variance were considered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  further by the board upon the additional information and evidence requested.  Against opposition and despite emergency Ordinance No. 618-60, the board on May 20, 1960, granted the appeal and allowed the requested variance in the zoning classification for relator's westerly 7.3 acres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereupon, relator applied to respondent Goller for the issuance of a building permit to construct shopping-center units and appurtenances on the 7.3-acre tract, which was refused in writing &quot;because of the City Attorney's opinion that Ordinance No. 618-60 precludes the Board of Zoning Adjustment from making the order issued by them on May 20, 1960.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, two persons filed appeals from the May 20, 1960, order of the Board of Zoning Adjustment to the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County.  Those appeals were dismissed.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the court below, and this court overruled the motion to require the Court of Appeals to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, William Beck, appellant herein, was charged in the Cleveland Municipal Court under Section 2915.111, Revised Code, with the offense of having in his possession and under his control on the 10th day of November 1961 certain clearinghouse slips.</SPAN></P>

The police stopped defendant's car and searched it without finding anything related to the scheme, but placed defendant under arrest. A subsequent examination of defendant's clothing revealed the illegal clearinghouse slips. Defendant was charged with possession of illegal clearinghouse slips pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The trial court overruled defendant's motion, a conviction was entered, and the appellate court upheld the conviction. According to the court, there was probable cause for an arrest and the police were searching for defendant in order to arrest him for possession of illegal clearinghouse slips, not merely for an exploratory search.

Then in the case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">R. K. O. Radio Pictures, Inc., </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> Department of Education</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1954), 162 Ohio St., 263, this court concluded that further censorship orders of the Department of Education must necessarily be invalid.  The total effect of those decisions was a finding that the Ohio statutes on film censorship were unconstitutional.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During the period between 1952 and 1954, plaintiff, while paying the required fees under the censorship statutes, informed the state officials charged with the enforcement of such statutes and the collection of fees thereunder that payment was being made under protest, and that plaintiff intended to sue to recover the amount of the payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter in December 1958 plaintiff instituted the present action to recover the payments from the following persons; Roger W. Tracy and Joseph T. Ferguson, both of whom had held the office of Treasurer of State; James A. Rhodes, who held the office of Auditor of State; and Clyde Hissong, R. Merle Eyman and Edward E. Holt, who had held the office of Superintendent of Public Instruction.  These named persons are the defendants, appellees herein, and herein will be referred to as defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recovery is sought from the defendants individually in their personal capacities and not from the state itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Court of Common Pleas the defendants filed a demurrer which was sustained on the ground that the petition does not state facts sufficient to show a cause of action against the defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trial court, but on different grounds, holding that plaintiff's remedy was to bring an action under Chapter 2723, Revised Code, for recovery of taxes, and that the one-year statute of limitations in Section 2723.01, Revised Code, was a bar to this action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is before this court on an appeal as of right and pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The film distributor paid censorship fees during certain years under Ohio motion picture censorship statutes, which were ultimately held to be unconstitutional. Thereafter, the distributor instituted the action to recover the payments. The trial court sustained defendants' demurrer and the appellate court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed on the ground that the distributor's remedy was to file an action under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2723 for recovery of taxes, and that the one-year statute of limitations in &sect; 2723.01 was a bar to the action. The court held that it was difficult to believe that the General Assembly, in Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2723.01, would have intended to provide an injunctive remedy only with respect to illegally levied taxes and assessments other than license fees. In the court's opinion, the license fees were &quot;taxes and assessments&quot; within the meaning of those words as used in the statute. Because the action for recovery was not filed within one year after the taxes and assessments were collected, the court held that any cause of action for their recovery was barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the decision of the appellate court, which sustained defendants' demurrer to the film distributor's action to recover payments for license fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Commission established rates for telephone service. On appeal, the telephone company contended that the Commission erred in allowing a given sum as an expense for federal taxes. The court held that: (1) the income tax that the telephone company was required to pay to the federal government under the income tax law on its annual dollar return could be calculated mathematically according to the federal income tax law to an exact accurate amount; (2) instead of allowing the known and accurate expense for taxes to the telephone company, the Commission created a hypothetical public utility company, which was done by capitalizing the statutory rate base and thus converting the statutory rate base into a capitalization rate base composed of fictitious amounts of debt and fictitious amounts of equity; (3) what the Commission did was error; and (4) for purposes of rate making, the statutory rate base of a public utility company was the dollar value of its property, used and useful, in rendering the public utility service, and that value was to be found by a determination of the reconstruction cost new less existing depreciation on the property of the public utility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the decision of establishing rates for the telephone company and remanded the case to the Commission for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The Commission asserted that a motor freight carrier could not arbitrarily enlarge its certificate of public convenience and necessity by the device of a joint rate arrangement. The court affirmed the Commission's order. The court held that the Commission had the authority to reject proposed joint rates between regular-route motor freight carriers and irregular-route motor freight carriers. The Commission had the function of supervising and regulating motor transportation companies under the authority conferred upon it by the general assembly as outlined in Ohio Rev.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These two causes originated in the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County, in each of which is sought a declaratory judgment that the Ohio Fair Trade Act, Sections 1333.27 through 1333.34, Revised Code, is invalid and unconstitutional.  The facts in both cases are similar and the law applicable is the same.  The appeals will be treated together, since the assignments of errors in both cases are exactly the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hudson Distributors, Inc., a Michigan corporation, operates a number of retail stores in Cleveland.  It brought these actions for the purpose of testing the constitutionality of the 1959 Ohio Fair Trade Act.  In one case, Hudson named as defendant the Eli Lilly Company, and, in the other, The Upjohn Company.  Both companies had complied with the Fair Trade Act, and Hudson had entered into no written contract with either.  Hudson procured the merchandise of Lilly from a distributor in Detroit.  Upjohn sold direct to the retailer or at times to the wholesaler.  Hudson sold the merchandise for less than the fair-trade price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In both causes, the Court of Common Pleas found that the Fair Trade Act is unconstitutional as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  an unlawful delegation of legislative power.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed the trial court's finding that the Ohio Fair Trade Act was unconstitutional and an unlawful delegation of legislative power. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1333.31 extended the original concept of the trademark to include, as a part of the ownership, a continuing proprietary interest in the trademark or trade name on the merchandise to the extent that the proprietor controlled the resale price of the merchandise even after it had left his possession and ownership. The court concluded that the general assembly properly determined that such extension of proprietary rights was necessary to protect the property rights and goodwill incorporated in the ownership of a trademark or trade name and also to protect the small-business man and the public in general. The court concluded that the legislative delegation of power was not price fixing but price maintenance contracts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The appellate court determined that Ohio Rev.

The court found the statute constitutional and, considering other issues, rejected the challenges to the rules of the civil service commission because they were not adopted in accordance with the APA, Ohio Rev.

The appellate court affirmed the overruling of the administrator's exceptions. On appeal, the administrator claimed that, under Ohio Rev.

No statute required apportionment of debts or federal estate tax. The court rejected the administrator's claim that because the will required the executor to sell the realty and pay debts, including death taxes, under the doctrine of equitable conversion, the realty was to be treated as personalty. The will did not clearly direct the executor to dispose of the realty, and failure to sell it did not interfere with estate settlement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certified Credit Corporation, appellant here, was incorporated in 1951 in Ohio for the purpose of engaging in the small-loan and consumer financing business.  In 1955, appellant decided to enter the life insurance and real estate investment business.  As of December 31, 1958, appellant had $ 1,663,760.97 invested in ten out-of-state subsidiaries; as of December 31, 1959, after acquisition of substantial assets located in Mississippi and Texas by merger with two non-Ohio corporations, it had $ 4,334,907.42 invested in 18 out-of-state subsidiaries; and as of December 31, 1960, having also entered the motel business, it had $ 7,986,019.35 invested in 24 out-of-state subsidiaries.  The record does not disclose the precise value of the various kinds of property held and business engaged in by appellant or the amounts of each allocable to Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On its dealer-in-intangibles tax return for 1959 and previous years, appellant arrived at the percentage of its capital employed in Ohio by determining the relationship between receipts from its small-loan and consumer finance business within Ohio and its total gross receipts from such business and expressing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the relationship as a percentage.  In preparing its 1960 and 1961 dealer-in-intangibles tax returns, appellant arrived at a percentage of capital employed in Ohio by determining the ratio between capital assets located in Ohio and its total capital assets and expressing the result as a percentage.  Appellant's 1959 return reported the proportion of capital employed in Ohio as 94.3 per cent of the total, whereas appellant's 1960 and 1961 returns reported the proportion of capital employed in Ohio as 36.29 per cent and 45.94 per cent, respectively.  The 1960 and 1961 returns also reported that receipts from appellant's Ohio small-loan and consumer finance business constituted 95.4 per cent and 98.45 per cent, respectively, of its total small-loan and consumer finance receipts in each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tax Commissioner issued an increased assessment certificate against appellant for the year 1960, reflecting a total net worth of $ 5,508,661.49, with 95.41 per cent thereof being attributable to appellant's shares of stock allocable to and taxable in Ohio.  For the year 1961, he issued an increased assessment certificate reflecting a total net worth of $ 5,760,671.75, with 98.45 per cent thereof&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  being attributable to appellant's shares of stock allocable to and taxable in Ohio.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 31, 1957, the appellant here, an Ohio corporation, was engaged principally in the business of financing refrigeration equipment manufactured by Uniflow Manufacturing Company of Erie, Pennsylvania.  The financing was predominately of sales of such refrigeration equipment to tavern owners by franchised dealers of Uniflow.  This type of financing accounted for approximately 75 per cent of appellant's business.  The remaining 25 per cent of its business consisted of financing the inventories of such refrigeration equipment for the same franchised Uniflow dealers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eight franchised Uniflow dealers were located in Columbus, Ohio; Chicago, Illinois; St. Louis, Missouri; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Covington, Kentucky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was a party to an agreement with each of the Uniflow franchised dealers, which in pertinent part provided:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) The dealer would submit to appellant for acceptance at Akron, Ohio, all conditional sales contracts, leases and notes, representing the balance due upon sales and leases made in the state of the dealer's domicile and covering Uniflow products, together with a current credit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  report on each purchaser or lessee of such equipment who would be designated as buyer upon &quot;said paper which is being submitted to Akron for discount&quot;.  The dealer also would submit to appellant its regular quarterly profit and loss statement and its balance sheet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) Appellant would make &quot;floor-plan finanacing&quot; loans upon refrigeration equipment up to specified amounts ($ 5,000 to $ 10,000 approximately).  The equipment so floor planned was to be listed in a chattel mortgage to appellant from the dealer.  Upon receipt in Akron of the mortgage and note appellant would make the loan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) The dealer agreed to collect payments on account from purchasers of Uniflow equipment and to deposit same to the appellant's account.  Should the dealer find it necessary to repossess the equipment, it was to notify appellant of the fact and at that time pay off the balance remaining due upon the account or contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refrigeration equipment was shipped direct to the dealer.  All invoices for equipment financed under the &quot;floorplan financing&quot; were paid in Akron.  Appellant maintained no sales force to sell equipment nor did it ever receive any of the refrigeration equipment.  Although the evidence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is not clear whether the dealer contracts were entered into at Akron or in the various cities where the dealers were located, the commercial paper involved was discounted at Akron.  All commercial paper discounted was with recourse to the franchised dealer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its dealer-in-intangibles return for 1958, appellant listed the book value of its total shares or invested capital at $ 270,236.64 but allocated only 6.8 per cent of this amount, or $ 18,376.09, for taxation by Ohio.  The Tax Commissioner, upon audit of the return, determined that all of appellant's capital, or $ 270,236.64, was taxable by Ohio because &quot;all of applicant's [appellant's] business originated and took place at its main and only office located in Akron, Ohio.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals, which found that the proof as to the business dealings that appellant carried on with the out-of-state franchised dealers at out-of-state locations and the relationship between the appellant and such dealers was no proof that appellant maintained &quot;separate business offices&quot; at the business locations of the out-of-state dealers, and therefore affirmed the Tax Commissioner's assessment.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that the taxpayer did not establish separate business offices by discounting commercial paper or by the sales and purchases of refrigeration equipment by the franchised dealers. The court noted that the taxpayer's business was the making of loans, which was done in the state, and the fact that such loans were secured by property located in a foreign state did not constitute the employment of capital in the foreign state. The court held that although some basis other than the maintenance of separate business offices might have been used for determining whether the capital of a dealer in intangibles is employed in this state, the standard had a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation and treated all persons similarly situated alike.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action in habeas corpus originating in this court.  The Grand Jury of Allen County returned an indictment charging petitioner, Rolland Maloney, with a violation of Section 2961.12, Revised Code, the Habitual Criminal Act.  Petitioner was arraigned on June 22, 1960.  He was advised of his right to counsel, and, being without funds, counsel was appointed for him.  Later on the same day, he was again arraigned and for a plea stood mute, and the court entered a plea of not guilty.

The court found no merit in the arguments, and it denied the request for habeas relief. There was no violation of equal protection by virtue of the fact that many persons who were subject to the Habitual Criminal Act were not prosecuted thereunder. Nor was &sect; 2961.12&nbsp;unconstitutional on the basis that it was indefinite and failed to state the crime completely. It cross-referenced crimes enumerated in Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2961.11. There was no double jeopardy with respect to a burglary offense as a result of the fact that two habitual criminal indictments had been returned against the inmate. Prior to trial, the first indictment at the request of the prosecutor was nol-prossed, and subsequently a new indictment was returned. The inmate showed no lack of jurisdiction in the trial court, nor any deprivation of his constitutional rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Hancock County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an appeal as of right, a constitutional question being involved, from a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Hancock County affirming a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of such county.  Plaintiffs, appellees herein, Mary E. Karrick and other nonteaching employees of the Board of Education of Findlay School District, hereinafter called the board, brought a declaratory judgment action to determine their status as employees of the board and of the school district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant Findlay Civil Service Commission, appellant herein and hereinafter called the commission, is one of two defendants, the other defendant being the board.  The members of the original commission were appointed soon after the adoption in 1912 of Section 10 of Article XV of the Constitution of Ohio, hereinafter called the civil service amendment.  The commission was created by Section 486-19, General Code ( Section 143.30, Revised Code), and in 1914 adopted rules and regulations which were amended in 1948 and on February 2, 1960.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The civil service act creating the commission, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in addition to giving it jurisdiction over city employees, also gave it jurisdiction over the employees of the board except those engaged in teaching, library work, research and administrative duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the time of the creation of the commission until early in 1942, it conducted civil service examinations for an undisclosed number of employees of the board.  The facts are not in dispute, and it was stipulated that in the 18- or 19-year period from 1942 to April 20, 1960, the commission held no examinations whatever with respect to any employees of the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board, however, continued to employ persons subject to civil service.  The janitors' payroll of Findlay city schools for September 1947 (exhibit A) contained the names of 15 persons with compensation for that month totalling $ 2,435.52.  The nonteaching employees' payroll of the Findlay city schools for September 1960 (exhibit B) contained the names of 93 persons with compensation for that month totalling $ 25,004.19.  Both exhibits have this endorsement at the bottom: &quot;Approved by the civil service commission as to those on civil service, Municipal Civil Service Comm., Findlay, Ohio, Edythe W. Morgan.&quot; It was stipulated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that there were similar payrolls for each month of each school year between 1947 and 1960, and that each such payroll contained a similar endorsement by the commission.  The name of each of the plaintiffs appears on exhibit B.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission's rules, as amended in 1948, required applicants for positions in the classified service to have been legal residents of Findlay for one year prior to filing their applications.  The rules established age limits of not less than 21 years and not more than 60 years, except that for school janitors the age limits were 22 and 60 years and for truant officers, 25 and 50 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 2, 1960, without advance notice, publication or the holding of a public hearing, the commission met and amended its rules as to nonteaching employees of the board to require that they be residents of the Findlay School District; that the maximum age for bus drivers and maintenance men be 60 years; and that the age limits for secretaries, clerk-typists and bookkeepers be 21 and 50 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission, after 18 years of inactivity so far as nonteaching school employees of the board were concerned, determined to hold competitive examinations on April 20, 1960, for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the positions of secretary, clerk and bookkeeper, causing legal notice thereof to be published in Findlay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the eight plaintiffs in this case, four resided outside the limits of the Findlay School District.  One is one year under the minimum age, two exceed the 50-year age limit and two others exceed the 60-year age limit.  On the day of the examinations, two of the plaintiffs, one who did not meet the residence requirement and one who did not meet the age requirement, appeared to take the examination but were not allowed by the commission to participate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the amended petition, it is claimed that Sections 143.01 and 143.08, Revised Code, are unconstitutional and in conflict with the civil service amendment; that the age and residence requirements are unreasonable, discriminatory and an abuse of discretion by the commission; that the board may employ nonteaching employees without certification by the commission; that the rules of the commission are void because they were not adopted in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 119, Revised Code); and that plaintiffs, some of whom have been employed by the board as long as 18 years, have thereby acquired civil service&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  status.  The answer filed by the commission contains a general denial, and the answer filed by the board neither admits nor denies the allegations of the petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In both the Common Pleas Court and the Court of Appeals, the judgments are that the rules of the commission had no effect on the status of the plaintiffs, but for different reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Common Pleas Court held that the commission's regulations adopted on February 2, 1960, are unreasonable and constitute an abuse of discretion; that the commission, although required to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act, failed to do so; and that its regulations are, therefore, void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals, in affirming the judgment of the Common Pleas Court, disagreed with the two reasons above set forth and held that the commission's regulations need not be adopted in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, and that, if the commission had the power to act, it did so in a reasonable and lawful manner, but that the case could not be decided without passing upon the constitutional question.  It then decided that the civil service amendment authorized the General Assembly to pass laws establishing civil&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  service regulations for employees in the service of the state, the several counties and the cities, and that there was no authority to extend civil service jurisdiction to other political subdivisions, and, hence, Section 143.30, Revised Code, so far as it applies to city school districts, is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board did not appeal from the judgment of the Common Pleas Court.  The commission has appealed as of right from the judgment of the Court of Appeals and has assigned as error the judgment of such court holding Section 143.30, Revised Code, unconstitutional in its attempt to bring nonteaching school employees under the jurisdiction of the commission.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 10, the civil service amendment, was enacted in 1912.

On February 2, 1960, without notice or hearing, the commission amended its rules to require non-teaching employees to be residents of the school district, and imposed age limits and civil service testing for certain positions. The non-teaching employees brought a declaratory judgment action to determine their employee status. The trial court found that the regulations did not effect the employees, were an abuse of discretion, and void. The appellate court affirmed because the legislature was authorized to pass laws establishing civil service regulations of the state, counties, and cities, but not to other political subdivisions, so &sect; 143.30, so far as it applied to city school districts, violated Ohio Const. art.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action in quo warranto originating in this court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relator's petition alleges that on November 5, 1961, Elmer F. Hunsicker, clerk of courts of Hamilton County, Ohio, died.  On November 6, 1961, a joint session of the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County entered an order appointing William Luke Leonard clerk of courts of Hamilton County, pro tempore, &quot;for a period not to exceed 30 days from date hereof, or until the appointment of a statutory successor * * * whichever is earlier in point of time.&quot; Pursuant to this order, Leonard assumed the office of clerk of courts of Hamilton County and took custody of the books, papers, records and funds belonging thereto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 13, 1961, the Board of County Commissioners of Hamilton County, pursuant to the provisions of Section 2303.04, Revised Code (this section was repealed and was reenacted as Section 305.02, Revised Code, on October 12, 1961), adopted a resolution appointing the relator, Ben Hayes, clerk of courts of Hamilton County, pro tempore, to serve for the term ending January 1, 1963.  The relator took the oath of office and executed a bond properly signed by an insurance company authorized&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to do business in Ohio.  Relator tendered his oath of office and bond with the approval of the county commissioners endorsed thereon to the Treasurer of Hamilton County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 16, 1961, relator demanded of William Luke Leonard that he surrender to relator the office of clerk of courts, which Leonard refused to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 30, 1961, the central committee of the Republican Party of Hamilton County, pursuant to the provisions of Section 305.02, Revised Code, effective October 12, 1961, passed a resolution which declared that the respondent, Robert D.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 5, 1961, the relator demanded that the respondent surrender the office to him and respondent refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator avers that Section 305.02, Revised Code, is unreasonable, unconstitutional and void, and that the portion of the section which repealed Section 2303.04 is void, and that, therefore, Section 2303.04 is in full force and effect.</SPAN></P>

The apportionment combined senatorial districts into one district and provided for the elections of senators in the combined district for future sessions. The petitioner filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel respondents to make a new apportionment. The Auditor and the Secretary filed a demurrer. Upon review, the court sustained the demurrer and denied the petitioner's application for a writ of mandamus. The court ruled that the mathematical inequalities in population between the districts that formed the combined district were insignificant. The court held that the petitioner's primary objection was to the manner in which respondents provided for the elections of senators in the combined district for future sessions. The court determined that there was no clear constitutional or statutory duty to fix the apportionment in a manner different than the apportionment adopted by respondents. Therefore, the court ruled that the petitioner was not entitled to a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The village of Blue Ash, a municipal corporation in Hamilton County, Ohio, brought this action in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County to enjoin the city of Cincinnati, likewise a municipal corporation in Hamilton County, from appropriating for airport purposes a presently used public street located within the corporate limits of the village of Blue Ash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previous to this suit the city of Cincinnati became the owner of land in an unincorporated portion of Sycamore Township, commonly known as Blue Ash; legal procedures followed, directed to the establishment of a municipal airport; plans for airport construction on its Blue Ash property were approved by the Civil Aeronautics Authority and the Ohio Aviation Board; and, under such plans, the principal runway bisects the public street herein involved in the now incorporated village of Blue Ash, and it is necessary to acquire the street easement for airport runway purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city of Cincinnati, in an effort to acquire the street, instituted an action in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County to assess compensation for the property.  The instant action for injunction&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second amended answer to the amended petition in this injunction action pleads, in part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * that under the Constitution and laws of the state of Ohio it [the city of Cincinnati] has the right to appropriate for airport purposes the existing easement for street purposes over the property described in the amended petition; that the zoning ordinance of the plaintiff village of Blue Ash to the extent, if any, it purports to prohibit the construction by the defendant city of Cincinnati of an airport in the village of Blue Ash having runways in excess of 3,000 feet is invalid and unconstitutional; and that the equities in this case are all in favor of the defendant city of Cincinnati and that the petition should be dismissed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Common Pleas, treating as a demurrer a motion to strike Cincinnati's second amended answer, sustained the demurrer, and, the city of Cincinnati electing not to plead further, judgment was rendered for the village of Blue Ash on its prayer for injunction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals of the First Appellate District, with one judge dissenting, reversed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The village sought an injunction to prevent the city from appropriating its street for purposes of building an airport runway. The common pleas court granted the injunction, and the court of appeals reversed. The court reversed the court of appeals, holding that although the city was empowered by the constitution and by statute to build and operate an airport, and to appropriate property to do so, the village had a concomitant right to keep its street, already dedicated to public use, free from appropriation by a neighbor municipal corporation, on the basis of a right under the Ohio Constitution. The court found that property already appropriated in the proper exercise of the power of eminent domain, could not be taken for another use which would wholly defeat or supersede the former use unless power to make such second appropriation was expressly granted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently after amended Section 4141.30, Revised Code, became effective on October 16, 1959, each employee filed an application for a redetermination and recomputation of his weekly benefit amount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Administrator of the Bureau of Unemployment Compensation allowed each employee an additional weekly benefit of $ 9, making a total of $ 42 per week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These additional allowances were affirmed by the Board of Review.</SPAN></P>

The employers contended that the statute was unconstitutional. One appellate court reversed the awards in favor of the employers, but the other appellate court affirmed the awards in favor of the employees. The court determined that the Bureau's determination was final upon establishment of the benefit year. The court found that it was each weekly claim that established whether an employee was paid benefits for such week. The court also held that the legislature had the right to amend or repeal the statute at any time. The court found that the amendment was not retrospective in nature but was a prospective statute and that it applied to the employees after their applications for benefits were filed.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action brought on behalf of the state of Ohio to enjoin the city of Akron from issuing and requiring separate city boat licenses for the operation of watercraft on waters owned by the city, contrary to the provision of Section 1501.23, Revised Code, prohibiting licensing by political subdivisions.  That provision now appears in Section 1547.61, Revised Code, without change, and reference will hereinafter be made to the latter statute.  The city admits the requirement of a separate city license and contends that the statute prohibiting separate licensing by political subdivisions is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Code. Ann. &sect; 1547.61 was unconstitutional. The challenged statute prohibited defendant political subdivision from imposing a license fee for the operation of watercraft on waters owned by the political subdivision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The political subdivision argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated its rights under Ohio Const. art.

XVIII, &sect; 3, also known as the home rule amendment. Finally, the political subdivision argued that the state statute deprived it of its property without due process of law. The court rejected the political subdivision's arguments. The court found that state government's requirement of a state license was valid exercise of the state government's police power. The court also pointed out that the political subdivision's reliance on Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 4 was misplaced because the use of the land in question was clearly a non-utility use or purpose. Also, the court noted that the state government had preempted the field, thus, Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3, did not provide relief. Finally, the court noted that the statute in question did not affect the title or the control over such waters and thus, the political subdivision was not deprived of its property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action was instituted by the Board of Education of the Jefferson Local School District (which board is herein referred to as the Jefferson board and which district is herein referred to as the Jefferson district) in the Common Pleas Court of Franklin County against the Board of Education of the Columbus City School District (which board is herein referred to as the Columbus board and which district is herein referred to as the Columbus district) and against the auditor and the treasurer of Franklin County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its amended petition, the Jefferson board alleges that on June 3, 1957, about 480 acres in the Jefferson district was annexed to the city of Columbus; that those 480 acres comprised part but not all of the Jefferson district; that the State Board of Education has not approved transfer of any portion of those 480 acres from the Jefferson to the Columbus district; that the Franklin County auditor for the years 1958 and 1959 wrongfully and unlawfully listed those 480 acres as being located in the Columbus district, determined from resolutions adopted by the Columbus board the sums to be levied for school purposes upon&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  those 480 acres, apportioned and certified the amounts of such sums collected as due the Columbus district and drew warrants on the county treasurer for the payment of such amounts to the Columbus district; and that, unless prevented by court order, the county auditor will pursue a like course of action for the year 1960 and subsequent years.  The Jefferson district asks for an accounting, injunction and equitable relief for the purpose of recovering from the Columbus district amounts collected from 1958 and 1959 school taxes levied on those 480 acres and for the purpose of requiring the county auditor to list those 480 acres in the Jefferson district for 1960 and subsequent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demurrer of the Columbus district to that amended petition was sustained and, the plaintiff having elected not to plead further, judgment was rendered for defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opinion of the Common Pleas Court discloses that that court sustained the demurrer on the ground that the cause was moot.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3311.06, which required the State Board of Education to approve the transfer, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Following a judgment for defendant, the appeals court affirmed, holding that &sect; 3311.06 was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power without guides or standards to the Board. Thereafter, plaintiff sought review. In reversing, the court cited Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26, which stated that &quot;All laws, of a general nature, shall have a uniform operation throughout the state; nor, shall any act, except such as relates to public schools, be passed, to take effect upon the approval of any other authority than the General Assembly.&quot; The court held that &sect; 26 expressly sanctioned statutes relating to public schools to take effect upon approval of authority other than the General Assembly. Consequently, the court held that Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court held that the same situation prevailed in all three years. On the day for listing property owned in 1958, the corporation held personal property, in the form of the aircraft, not licensed under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4561.18 and the court held that the tax commissioner was correct in his contention that it was taxable as personal property for that year, the same as for two other years. The corporation's claim of an unconstitutional interpretation and application of the statutes was not well founded. It should have complied with the law relating to the licensing of aircraft to escape the general personal property tax. The failure to do so made the aircraft amenable to taxation the same as other personal property. By its own inaction, it placed itself under the law relating to taxation of personal property generally. In the absence of the aircraft licensing law, aircraft was taxed as ordinary personal property.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edward J. Wetzel, the appellee herein, was indicted by the Grand Jury of Wyandot County in the following language:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The jurors of the Grand Jury * * * do find and present that Edward J. Wetzel * * * on the 8th day of February * * * 1960, at the county of Wyandot aforesaid, did unlawfully and knowingly have in his possession and under his control, obscene, lewd and lascivious picture photographs, pamphlets and other articles all of an indecent and immoral nature and all of which are too obscene for further description within the limits of decency and contrary to Section 2905.34 of the Revised Code of Ohio, and against the peace and dignity of the state of Ohio.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pleaded not guilty and was tried before the Court of Common Pleas.  A verdict of guilty was returned by the jury, and the defendant was sentenced to imprisonment in the Ohio Penitentiary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An appeal on questions of law to the Court of Appeals reresulted in a reversal of the judgment below and an order directing the discharge of the defendant.  Such reversal was based on the determination that the part of Section 2905.34, Revised Code, under which the defendant was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  indicted and tried, is unconstitutional and void, being in violation of &quot;Article I, Section 11 of the Constitution of Ohio and the provisions of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State sought review of a judgment from the Court of Appeals for Wyandot County (Ohio), which reversed a judgment convicting defendant of possessing obscene, lewd, and lascivious material in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.34. In reversing, the appeals court held that &sect; 2905.34 was unconstitutional because it violated Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 11 and U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After obscene, lewd, and lascivious material was discovered in defendant's possession, defendant was convicted of violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.34, which stated that &quot;no person shall knowingly have in his possession or under his control an obscene, lewd, or lascivious book.&quot; Thereafter, the appeals court reversed, holding that &sect; 2905.34 violated Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 11 and U.S. Const. amend. I because it applied to any person. Following the reversal, the State sought review. Upon review, the court held that if the operation of a statute was constitutional under one state of facts, the statute could not be declared invalid because its operation was unconstitutional under another state of facts not involved. In reversing, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.34 was constitutional and valid as applied to defendant because the evidence demonstrated that defendant possessed the pornographic material with knowledge of its nature and that the material was held for sale and distribution. In so holding, the court distinguished the situation from one where an individual merely possessed pornographic material for his own private purposes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relator, the Board of Education of the Whitehall City School District, has invoked the original jurisdiction of this court for the purpose of obtaining a writ of mandamus to require the respondent, the Board of Education of the Columbus City School District, to assume $ 450,103.71 of the relator's bonded indebtedness and also to pay the relator the sum of $ 49,103.21, less a credit of $ 3,215.21, by reason of municipal annexation proceedings whereby the respondent acquired certain land, buildings and appurtenances from the relator.</SPAN></P>

Respondent refused to pay and relator filed an action for mandamus to compel respondent to meet its obligations. The court granted the writ. Respondent argued that the Board was without authority to make a complete determination of the matter because &sect; 3311.06 provided that the division of funds and debts was to be made under the &quot;supervision&quot; of the Board. The court rejected that argument, noting that the word &quot;supervise&quot; was synonymous with superintend, which meant to oversee with power of direction. The court noted further that &sect; 3311.06 stated that the Board's decision was to be final, thereby indicating that the board had authority to make a complete determination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case No. 36873, it is alleged in the petition filed in the Common Pleas Court by plaintiff, an automobile dealer, that the dealer sold an automobile to a certain buyer on July 17, 1959, and attached to the application for a certificate of title for that buyer prepaid sales tax stamps in the proper amount of the tax imposed with respect to that sale but that defendant clerk of courts refused to issue a certificate of title because the tax was not paid to defendant by cash, certified check, draft or money order in accordance with the requirements of Section 4505.06, Revised Code, as amended effective July 1, 1959.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case No. 36874, similar allegations are made in the petition filed in the Common Pleas Court by the buyer of that automobile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff in each case contends that certain amendments to Sections 5739.03 and 4505.06, Revised Code, which became effective July 1, 1959, are unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Section 5739.02, Revised Code, &quot;an excise tax is * * * levied on each retail sale made in&quot; Ohio with certain specified exceptions.  The amount of the tax is dependent upon the price; and, generally speaking, it amounts to three&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  per cent of the price involved in a taxable sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 5739.03, Revised Code, reads in part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * the tax imposed by Section 5739.02 * * * shall be paid by the consumer to the vendor, and each vendor shall collect from the consumer the full and exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable sale, and, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">unless a receipt therefor is required to be issued by a Clerk of a Court of Common Pleas under the provisions of Section 4505.06</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * * * shall evidence the payment of the tax by cancelling prepaid tax receipts, equal in face value to the amount of the tax * * *.&quot; (Emphasis added to indicate portion added by amendment effective July 1, 1959.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequent provisions of that section provide for delivery of &quot;one part of each such cancelled prepaid tax receipt to the consumer.&quot; These prepaid tax receipts are commonly referred to as sales tax stamps and are frequently saved for charitable and other organizations for redemption by them at two per cent of their face value pursuant to the provisions of Sections 5741.08 and 5741.09, Revised Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to July 1, 1959, Section 4505.06, Revised Code, provided in part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the case of the sale of a motor vehicle by a dealer to a general&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  purchaser or user, the certificate of title shall be obtained in the name of the purchaser by the dealer upon application signed by the purchaser.  In all other cases such certificate shall be obtained by the purchaser.  * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The clerk, except as * * * [to nontaxable sales], shall refuse to accept for filing any application for a certificate of title and shall refuse to issue a certificate of title </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">unless prepaid tax receipts required by Section 5739.03 * * * are presented with the application in the manner and form to be prescribed by the Tax Commissioner or</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unless the applicant submits with the application, payment of such tax by cash, certified check, draft, or money order payable to the clerk who shall issue a receipt in the form prescribed by the commissioner, or a receipt issued by the commissioner showing the payment of the tax.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Such receipts are consumer's portions of prepaid tax receipts for the purposes of Sections 5741.08 and 5741.09 * * * and are subject to redemption in the same manner and at the same rate as the redemption of consumer's portions of prepaid tax receipts</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot; (Emphasis added to indicate portions deleted by amendment effective July 1, 1959.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Common Pleas Court sustained demurrers to each of the foregoing petitions and, the plaintiffs not desiring to plead further, rendered a judgment of dismissal in each action.</SPAN></P>

The Clerk refused to issue the title and appellees filed actions challenging the validity of amendments. The trial court sustained respondent's demurrer and dismissed appellees' petitions. The appellate court reversed and the Clerk appealed. Appellees' position was that the amendments were unconstitutional in that they singled out car sales as the only transaction for which the tax had to be paid by cash or check. The court stated that the legislature had the right to designate car sellers as a class to be deprived of certain opportunities if there were a substantial reason for doing so. The court noted that the tax stamps were a means of enlisting the aid of vendors in collecting the tax and stated that the aid of the car dealer was not needed because the title to the car had to be transferred by a government official who would ensure that the tax was paid.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the facts alleged in relator's petition and admitted in the amended answer of the respondent, Governor of Ohio, it appears that, effective November 2, 1959, the General Assembly created the State Racing Commission consisting of five members to be appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate.  Section 3769.02, Revised Code.  Subsequent to the adjournment of the Senate at the closing of the regular session of the 103rd General Assembly and prior to the next session of the Senate which convened on November 28, 1960, the respondent appointed Harry M. Hoffheimer, of Cincinnati, to the State Racing Commission for a term beginning November 2, 1959, and ending April 1, 1963.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The respondent reported said appointment, along with several others, to the next session of the Senate on November 28, 1960.  The Senate adjourned sine die on November 29, 1960, without giving its advice and consent as to the appointment of Hoffheimer and without acting in any manner, either affirmatively or negatively, on said appointment, although it affirmatively acted on several other appointments.  Hoffheimer has continued to serve as a member of the State Racing Commission. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The relator alleges in his petition that the respondent is under a clear legal duty to make a new appointment to the vacancy created by the Senate's failure to advise and consent as to Hoffheimer's appointment, that the respondent is under a clear legal duty to submit such new appointment to the Senate of the 104th General Assembly, and that Hoffheimer may not be reappointed to the same term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prayer of the petition is to the effect that the respondent be required to make a new appointment to the State Racing Commission for the term beginning November 2, 1959, and ending April 1, 1963, and that such appointment be of someone other than Hoffheimer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amended answer of the respondent raises two defenses:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first is that, since the appointment of Hoffheimer, sent to the Senate on November 28, 1959, was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Rules but was never presented to that committee or any committee of the Senate and was never presented to the Senate for a vote of confirmation or rejection, and since the appointment was again sent to the Senate of the 104th General Assembly, which has as yet taken no action with respect to said appointment, there is no official duty&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  enjoined upon the respondent by law remaining unfulfilled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second defense of the respondent is that any provision of Section 3769.02, Revised Code, which makes or purports to make such appointment contingent upon the advise and consent of the Senate, is unconstitutional and void as making the Genreal Assembly a participant in the appointing power in contravention of Section 27, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issues are raised by a demurrer to the amended answer.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Relator brought an action in mandamus against respondent governor to compel the governor to make a new appointment to the State Racing Commission pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3769.02. The governor raised two defenses by way of answer, and the relator demurred to the answers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The governor appointed five members to the Commission, but although the senate gave its advice and consent to the appointment of the other members, the senate adjourned without giving its advice and consent or acting in any manner on the appointment of one member. Relator claimed that the governor had a duty to make a new appointment and that the appointment had to be of a new member. The governor claimed that he had fulfilled his duty in appointing the member and referring it to the senate and that the provision of &sect; 3769.02 that made the appointment contingent on the senate was unconstitutional. The court denied the writ and found that the provision concerning the advice and consent by the senate did provide for a participation pro tanto by the general assembly, which participation was expressly disallowed under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 27. The court held that because the advice and consent of the senate was a necessary part of the appointment, as evidenced by the petition, and because the act of the senate alone could be considered an act of the general assembly, that portion of the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 3, 1958, in the Cincinnati Municipal Court, defendant, Joseph L. Marshall, appellant herein, was convicted for violation of Section 901-i3 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Cincinnati which makes it a misdemeanor to possess or sell obscene writings or pictures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The affidavit upon which the successful prosecution was based alleges that defendant &quot;did unlawfully have under his control obscene, lewd and indecent publications.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 901-i3 provides in part as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whoever shall print * * * sell * * * exhibit as for sale or other purpose, or have in his possession or under his control, any obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent * * * book, pamphlet, paper, picture * * * or shall exhibit upon the public street or highway, any of the articles or papers * * * as aforesaid, within view of passersby upon said street or highway, shall be fined not more than $ 500 or imprisoned not more than six months or both * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the trial, defendant filed a demurrer to the affidavit, which demurrer attacks the constitutionality of the ordinance in question on the ground that, because the ordinance fails to include&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">scienter</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or knowledge as an essential element of the offense, it contravens the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.  Other grounds for the unconstitutionality of the ordinance are urged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant is the president of a corporation engaged in the wholesale distribution of magazines and newspapers in the city of Cincinnati.  The record herein reveals that the company distributes to retail newsstands approximately 1,000 different magazines, newspapers and books per month.  The company employs approximately 70 employees and operates 17 trucks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the trial of this cause, defendant testified that most of his suppliers are located in the east; that his company does not select the magazines that it sells; that it has no right of selection; that magazines come in every day; that some magazines go out the same day they are received; and that others may remain in the warehouse for as long as a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 2, 1958, the police confiscated a large number of magazines from defendant's company's warehouse.  These magazines, 14 of which were admitted in evidence at the trial, form the basis of the charge against the defendant.  It appears that on that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  October date defendant was in Chicago and had been in that city for ten days preceding October 2.  Upon his return to Cincinnati, defendant voluntarily appeared at police headquarters in Cincinnati and was arrested for violation of the ordinance in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's counsel examined defendant, as follows, concerning the 14 magazines which comprised the prosecution's exhibits:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Q. Did you see those magazines when they came in?  A. No.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, defendant testified as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Q. Let me ask you this.  Would you knowingly have in your possession, or did you knowingly have in your possession or -- well, put it this way.  On October 2, 1958 -- obscene or lewd magazines?  * * * A. No, sir, and I never will.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his charge to the jury, the trial judge stated, in part, as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The intent of the defendant, if you find in fact he did have the materials under his control, is of no matter in this case.  Whether the defendant had a good or an evil or an unlawful&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  intent is of no concern for you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The indecent publications ordinance makes the mere possession of having under his control obscene, lewd or indecent materials unlawful, and the intent with which they are possessed or held is of no consequence.  The ordinance provides no exception by reason of the existence of any good, bad, indifferent or special intent in the possession of the materials.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the conviction of defendant in the Municipal Court, appeal was taken to the Court of Common Pleas and subsequently to the Court of Appeals.  In each appeal defendant renewed his attack on the ordinance as being unconstitutional.  The judgment of conviction was affirmed in both the Court of Common Pleas and the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant engaged in the wholesale distribution of magazines and, without his knowledge, possessed obscene material. When the obscene material was discovered, defendant was convicted of possessing obscene, lewd, and indecent publications in violation of Cincinnati, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 901-i3. Following the conviction's affirmance, defendant sought review, claiming that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it made criminal liability absolute on mere proof of possession without regard to scienter or knowledge. In reversing, the court ruled that because the ordinance imposed an absolute criminal liability without reference to any knowledge on the part of the accused, the ordinance was invalid and in conflict with the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. In so ruling, the court held that scienter or knowledge was constitutionally essential in an offense which related to speech or press and that the mental element could not be eliminated from the crime of possession or dissemination of obscene matter. The court held that eliminating the mental element tended to impose a severe limitation on the public's access to constitutionally protected matter.</SPAN></P>

By the date the state school board declared its &quot;intention&quot; to approve the transfer, a second amendment, still retaining the requirement that such a transfer be approved by the state school board, had become effective. The village school board contended that the amendments were applicable while the city school board insisted that they were not. The court adopted the reasoning of an appellate court that had considered the issue and concluded that, although it was unsure which amendment applied, the unamended statute did not control and approval of the state school board was required to complete a transfer of territory. Denying the petitions of both parties, however, the court found that the state school board's &quot;intention&quot; to approve the transfer was not a definitive statement of approval and that the transfer was not, therefore, completed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An annexation petition was filed February 27, 1959, with the Lucas County Board of County Commissioners by one resident freeholder (the only one residing in the territory to be annexed), seeking to annex a portion of Washington Township, Lucas County, to the city of Toledo.  After hearing, the petition was granted.</SPAN></P>

Shortly after, appellants filed an action to enjoin the annexation. Appellants argued that the annexation was unconstitutional because school districts would overlap, and unvoted tax levies would be imposed. The trial court granted an injunction, but the court of appeals denied the injunction. The court affirmed on appeal. The court held that constitutional questions were not before it. Rather, the issue was whether the petition by the resident freeholder for the annexation of territory, which contained the language, &quot;for municipal purposes, according to the statutes of Ohio,&quot; was valid under the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 709.02 and 3311.06. The court held that the words accurately described the purpose of the annexation under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.02 and did not conflict with the procedure established in Ohio Rev.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action originated in the Cincinnati Municipal Court.  The plaintiff, Lindsay, appellee herein, seeks a writ of replevin requiring the defendant, city of Cincinnati, appellant herein, to return to him an automobile which had been seized by the Cincinnati Police Department, pursuant to Section 407-134 of the Code of Ordinances of the city, which provides that any police officer, who finds a vehicle being operated as a public vehicle (taxicab) without a city license, shall take possession of the vehicle and arrest the person in charge thereof, and upon conviction of the person arrested, the court shall order the vehicle sold at public sale and the proceeds of the sale, after deduction of expenses and payment of liens, paid to the general fund of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff lent his automobile to one Harper for the purpose of having it driven to a repair shop and without any knowledge that Harper intended to use the vehicle as a &quot;bootleg cab&quot; or for any other illegal purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harper used the automobile as a taxicab contrary to the city ordinance and was arrested by the city police.

Harper was convicted of the charge, and the court ordered the car sold pursuant to the provisions of Section 407-134 of the Code of Ordinances.  This action in replevin to recover possession of the car was brought by the plaintiff prior to the sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Municipal Court sustained the demurrer of the city to the petition, on the ground that Section 407-134 of the Code of Ordinances is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County reversed the judgment of the Municipal Court, on the ground that Section 407-134 of the Code of Ordinances is unconstitutional as applied to those cases where the person arrested for operating a vehicle as a public vehicle without a license is not the owner of the vehicle, because the ordinance does not afford the owner, but only the operator of the vehicle, an opportunity to be heard.</SPAN></P>

The owner made a plea that the penalty was too severe on an innocent owner. The court reversed the owner's award. The purpose of the city ordinance was to prohibit insolvent, inadequately insured, and unqualified drivers from using unsafe vehicles as taxicabs. The automobile was used for an illegal purpose in violation of the ordinance, and the driver was convicted of violating the ordinance. The owner's argument raised a question of public policy that had to be decided by the appropriate legislative authority and was not within the province of the court. The municipality's authority to seize and forfeit the otherwise lawfully used property that the owner lent to the driver and was illegally used by the driver was within the police power of the municipality. The ordinance was constitutional even though the owner had no knowledge of the illegal use and did not lend the property to be used for any illegal purpose.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the stores were sold, the Tax Commissioner began a separate audit of each of the stores for such audit period, when they were owned and operated by appellants.

The Tax Commissioner made test checks of the five other stores, included in which were the three stores here involved.  On the basis of these checks, appellants were given credit for nontaxable sales and deficiency assessments were issued against these three stores.

The Board affirmed the Tax Commissioner's order. On appeal, the issue was whether Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5739.10, so far as it permitted the use of test checks outside the actual audit period to determine the tax liability for sales made during the audit period, was constitutional. The court held that the statute was constitutional and affirmed the Board's decision. The court held that whether a test check covered &quot;a representative period&quot; was a factual question to be determined by the Board. The court found that the record did not disclose any reason other than change of ownership to lead it or the Board to the conclusion that the test-check periods were not representative.

Once incarcerated, the prisoner filed a habeas corpus proceeding, arguing that the trial court did not have jurisdiction because Ohio Rev.

The court held that Ohio Rev.

The accused still had the right to insist on an indictment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant in cause No. 36471, the United Engineering &amp; Foundry Company, is engaged in manufacturing, fabricating and installing iron- and steel-making equipment on a job-order basis, from the drafting of specifications, blue prints and engineering drawings to the completed mill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In listing its taxable property for the tax year 1956, under Section 5711.16, Revised Code, appellant computed its inventory, including engineering drawings, by taking the average of the preceding year's (1955) month-end values.  In computing the value of engineering drawings, appellant excluded values for the months of January through September 1955.  The Tax Commissioner, pursuant to audit, added back such excluded values and made his assessment accordingly.  There was no issue as to values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals from the final order of the Tax Commissioner, contending that the commissioner erred in including the value of the engineering drawings as an element of inventory valuation for the months preceding October 4, 1955, since the drawings were entitled to exemption from taxation under Section 5701.03, Revised Code, as it read&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  prior to its amendment effective October 4, 1955, which amendment removed such property from the exempted list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant in cause No. 36472, The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, a foreign corporation, is engaged in manufacturing and merchandising foodstuffs in Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its 1956 Ohio personal property tax return, it listed for taxation its inventory as required by law, except that it did not include therein the value of certain inventory which it claimed was held by it &quot;for storage only&quot; prior to September 30, 1955.  Its fiscal year begins on March 1.  The Tax Commissioner, upon audit of such tax return, included the omitted values of inventory in the base to determine appellant's 1956 personal property tax liability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals from the final order of the Tax Commissioner, contending that the commissioner erred in not excluding from assessment those inventories held by appellant in the months preceding September 30, 1955, and which were exempted from tax as held &quot;for storage only&quot; by a foreign corporation, under former Section 5701.08, Revised Code, as it read prior to its amendment effective September 30, 1955, which amendment removed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such property from the exempted list.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayers were manufacturing companies and the Tax Commissioner determined that certain inventory or personal property of the taxpayers was subject to tax in 1956 under Ohio Rev.

The taxpayers claimed that because the statutes were amended in October and September 1955, the Tax Commissioner's use of the statutes were retroactive and unconstitutional. The Board affirmed the Tax Commissioner's tax orders. The court affirmed on appeal. The court found that the Tax Commissioner did not apply the law retroactively and was not taxing property exempted during a part of 1955. The court held that the computation of tax under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5711.15 and 5711.16 was proper. The court held that a statute was not retroactive merely because it drew on antecedent facts for a criterion in its operation. The court found that the value of the 1955 inventories, as determined by the Tax Commissioner, was only the norm for fixing the value of the 1956 inventories.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Summit County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action was commenced in the Common Pleas Court of Summit County by the filing of a petition by the city of Akron alleging that defendant is the owner and operator of a junk yard at 333 Euclid Avenue, Akron, in an area zoned for residence only, that defendant's operation of that junk yard constitutes a nuisance, and that defendant is operating his junk yard in violation of ordinance 100-1956.  The prayer of the petition is for the abatement of that nuisance and for an injunction against its continuance and against the operation of an illegal junk-yard business in a residential neighborhood, and for general equitable relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant filed an answer denying that his operation constitutes a nuisance and alleging in effect that his operation of the junk yard constitutes a lawful nonconforming use.  Defendant further filed a cross-petition alleging that the city had tried to prevent the defendant from lawfully operating his business and using his property by enacting ordinance 100-1956 and causing legal actions to be instituted against defendant and that that ordinance is unconstitutional and invalid, and praying that the city&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be permanently enjoined and restrained from interfering with defendant's occupancy and use of his property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far as pertinent, ordinance 100-1956 reads:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In any residential use district as established by the zoning ordinance, any junk yard or wrecked motor-vehicle yard, or used building materials yard, shall maintain an open, unoccupied space 10 feet in width on each side of any lot or plat of ground used for the storage or handling of such materials.  Unless within a fireproof building as provided for elsewhere in the code * * * on each such 10 foot setback side line a solid board fence * * * must be constructed.  No junk, wrecked motor-vehicle, used building material or similar salvage material shall be stored in such an enclosure to a greater height than such fences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In any junk yard, wrecked motor-vehicle yard or used building materials yard, in any residential use district, any other provision of law notwithstanding, the rear yard and the front yard as established by the building line of any such junk yard, wrecked motor-vehicle yard or used building material yard shall be that of the zoning ordinance provisions, but in no event less than 10 feet.  Upon this rear yard line&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (10 feet or more inside of the rear property line) and upon the building line a solid board fence shall be built * * *.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any junk yard, wrecked motor-vehicle yard or used building materials yard in any residential use district shall cease operations between the hours of 6 p. m. and the following 7 a. m. and also all day on Sunday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant owns two city lots (one with 37 3/8 and the other with 48 3/4 feet frontage and both 150 feet deep) upon one of which is located a house which he rents to a tenant.  Defendant's junk yard, which is enclosed by a fence, occupies these two lots behind the front building line except for the portion occupied by the house and 30 or 40 square feet behind the house which is outside the fence.  There are no buildings used in the operation of defendant's junk-yard business which is apparently a one-man operation.  One Ben Chapman began the operation of a junk-yard business on these two lots in 1916.  In 1922, Akron enacted a comprehensive zoning ordinance.  These two lots were included in a residential-use district under that ordinance and have been so included since that time.  They are now located in a closely built up residential district.  Ben Chapman&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  died in 1947 and his son thereafter continued operation of that business on those lots until he was forced to leave after foreclosure proceedings brought by the Dime Bank.  Defendant purchased these two lots from the Dime Bank which had bought them at foreclosure sale.  Thereafter, while Chapman's son was moving his junk-yard business out, defendant moved his junk-yard business into and has since conducted it on these two lots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By its judgment the Common Pleas Court found that defendant's operation of his junk yard constitutes a nuisance and ordered that that nuisance be permanently abated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal from that judgment on questions of law and fact, the Court of Appeals determined that &quot;the petition of the city * * * should be * * * dismissed, * * * that that portion of * * * ordinance No. 100-1956 requiring * * * [defendant] to cease operations between 6 p. m. and * * * 7 a. m. is unconstitutional; that that portion * * * prohibiting the working on Sunday is invalid as applied to * * * [defendant]; that that portion * * * pertaining to setback lines and fence heights is unenforceable as applied to * * * [defendant];&quot; and that court dismissed the city's petition and permanently&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  enjoined the city &quot;from further interfering with the occupancy and use of defendant's property at 333 Euclid Avenue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court on appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeals as an appeal as of right and pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant city appealed from the Court of Appeals for Summit County (Ohio), which found in favor of appellee, the owner and operator of a junk yard, in an area zoned for residence only, in the suit alleging that the junkyard constituted a nuisance and was in violation of a city ordinance and praying for the abatement of the nuisance and for an injunction against its continuance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court of appeals determined that the petition of the city should be dismissed. It found that that portion of the ordinance requiring the junkyard owner to cease operations between 6 p.m. and 7 a.m. was unconstitutional and that a portion prohibiting the working on Sunday was invalid as applied to the junkyard owner. Further, that portion pertaining to setback lines and fence heights was held to be unenforceable as applied to the junkyard owner and dismissed the city's petition and permanently enjoined the city from further interfering with the occupancy and use of the junkyard owner's property. The court of appeals erred in holding invalid the provisions of the ordinance with respect to night and Sunday operations and in failing to enjoin the junkyard owner from such operations. However, the court agreed that the portion of the ordinance that pertained to setback lines and fence heights was unenforceable as applied to the junkyard owner. Where the zoning ordinance provided that the lawful use of any premises existing at the time of its enactment could be continued as a nonconforming use, such ordinance continued the junkyard owner's right to use the premises.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an original action in quo warranto to require respondent A. M. Kinney, Inc., to show by what warrant it claims to hold the right to engage in engineering under the laws of the state of Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The respondent, which has filed a demurrer to the petition on the ground that it does not state facts showing a cause of action, is a corporation organized under the laws of Ohio on February 4, 1929.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Relator, the Attorney General of the State of Ohio, filed a petition for a writ of quo warranto to require respondent corporation to show by what warrant it claimed to hold the right to engage in engineering under the laws of the State of Ohio. The corporation filed a demurrer to the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In 1929, the corporation was organized for the purpose of engaging in activities in conjunction with engineering. In 1933, the legislature enacted Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 1083-18, which allowed a firm, a copartnership, or an association to engage in the practice of professional engineering. In 1943, the legislature amended the statute to provide that no corporation would thereafter be granted a charter to engage in the practice of engineering. The Attorney General filed a petition for a writ of quo warranto to require the corporation to show by what warrant it claimed to hold the right to engage in engineering. The court held that all engineering corporations organized prior to 1943 could still legally engage in the practice of engineering because the 1943 amendment to Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 1083-18 preserved and validated existing engineering corporations. The court also held that the amendment's validation of existing engineering corporations did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment because it was reasonable for the legislature to consider the positions of existing engineering corporations and to allow them to continue in practice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this action, the appellant herein, city of Lakewood (hereinafter referred to as Lakewood), questions the constitutionality of the proviso contained in the second paragraph of Section 5521.01, Revised Code, which authorizes the appellees, acting Director of Highways and Director of Highways (hereinafter referred to as director), to relocate federal aid primary highways (hereinafter referred to as f. a. p. highways) within a municipality without the municipality's consent by following a certain procedure.  Lakewood also maintains that the procedure followed demed it due process of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pertinent portion of Section 5521.01, Revised Code, including the proviso under scrutiny herein, is as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Director of Highways, upon the request by and the approval of the legislative authority of a village, shall maintain, repair, and center line paint, or may establish, construct, reconstruct, improve, or widen any section of a state highway within the limits of a village.  The director may establish, construct, reconstruct, improve, widen, maintain, or repair any section of state highway within the limits of a city, including&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the elimination of railway grade crossings, and pay the entire or any part of the cost and expense thereof from state funds, but in all cases he shall first obtain the consent of the legislative authority of such municipal corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Provided, that when a federal aid primary highway or a federal aid interstate highway is located within a municipal corporation and, in the opinion of the director, is in urgent need of repair, reconstruction, widening, improvement, or relocation, so as to accommodate the traveling public, the Director of Highways shall submit a written request to the legislative authority of the municipality for its consent to the desired improvement.  The legislative authority shall within 60 days after such written request has been received from the director either grant its consent to the improvement or refuse such consent by filing in writing with the director a statement of its reasons for refusing the consent and such alternate proposals as it deems reasonable.  If the legislative authority fails to act or refuses consent, the director may upon consideration of the reasons for rejection make a resolution declaring the necessity of said improvement which shall&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be spread upon his journal and then proceed in the same manner as if consent had been given.  A certified copy of said resolution shall be served upon the municipal legislative authority which may, within 20 days from the date of said service, appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of the county in which such municipal corporation is situated, upon the reasonableness and necessity of the action provided for in the resolution.  In the hearing upon appeal the director may introduce the record of his proceedings and such other competent evidence as he desires in support of his resolution, and the municipality may likewise introduce competent evidence opposing such resolution.  The court may affirm or revoke said resolution.  The decision of the Common Pleas Court may be appealed to the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court as in other cases.  If the court affirms said resolution the director may proceed with said improvement with or without the co-operation of said municipality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before 1947 there was no provision of law which enabled the director to construct a highway in a municipality or relocate the same without the consent of that municipality.  In that year the Legislature amended&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Section 1178-42, General Code, to provide such power under certain conditions.  That section, without substantial change, became Section 5521.01, Revised Code, in the Recodification Act of 1953, and in 1955 it was again amended to its present form.  The director has never previously had occasion to use the same, and its constitutionality in its entirety has never been passed upon by this court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed action of the director to which objection is made is the relocation and new construction of 1.1 miles of State Route No. 2 and U.S. Routes Nos. 6 and 20 in the city of Lakewood, the construction of a new bridge across Rocky River and a relocation of said routes in the city of Rocky River, all at an estimated cost of some 5.75 million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 24, 1957, under the authority of Section 5511.01, Revised Code, and pursuant to notice theretofore given, the director held a hearing where arguments were presented for and against the proposed location.  On July 11, 1957, the director by resolution did relocate and establish as a limited-access highway said State Route No. 2 and U.S. Routes Nos. 6 and 20 as described in the notice of hearing.  On July 29, 1957, a copy of the resolution&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was forwarded to the city of Lakewood with a request that it pass a consent ordinance.  As evidenced by a resolution of city council of September 25, 1957, this Lakewood refused to do, stating its reasons and suggesting alternate proposals.  Then on November 1, 1957, the director journalized a resolution determining that in his opinion State Route No. 2 and U.S. Routes Nos. 6 and 20 were in urgent need of relocation and improvement.  A copy of this resolution was certified to Lakewood, and within the time limited Lakewood appealed to the Common Pleas Court of Cuyahoga County upon the reasonableness and necessity of the action authorized by the resolution and as provided by said Section 5521.01, Revised Code.  After full hearing (the printed record consists of some 600 pages), the court refused to revoke the resolution and affirmed the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal to the Court of Appeals, that judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right and the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

Journalization was permitted under &sect; 5521.01, the court found, because otherwise the state would be deprived of several benefits. The court held that the director lawfully conducted a hearing regarding his proposed actions under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 5511.01. Fair administrative consideration was provided to the city under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 5521.01, the court found, as the city had justifiably delegated authority to the director. The court found that the city received due process of law under the general appeal process created by &sect; 5521.01 and held the statute constitutional under Ohio Const. art.

An order was forwarded to the Ohio trial court and assigned for trial. The father appeared with an attorney, and after trial, the husband was found liable for support, but in a lesser amount than found by the North Carolina court. The father made partial payments, but after defaulting and being cited for contempt, he filed his motion to vacate and set aside the order because he was denied due process of law. The court affirmed and held that under the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, Ohio Rev.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff, Robert S. Ladd, became employed by defendant, The New York Central Railroad Company, as a fireman in June 1941.  He served in the United States Navy Seabees from the last part of 1943 into January 1946, when he returned to work with the railroad.  He was promoted to a rating of engineer as of January 15, 1951, but continued his work as a fireman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night of December 6, 1951, at about 11 p. m., he reported for work and later, during the early morning hours of December 7, while working on an engine pulling cars from one yard to another, he became ill, necessitating his relief from duty at about 4 a. m.  He did not see a doctor at that time but returned to work that night at 11 p. m.  He was voluntarily off for a funeral following that night and returned to work on the night of the 10th.  On the 11th he was notified that he was temporarily relieved from duty pending a physical examination.  He was examined in the office of Dr. Burkholder, the New York Central surgeon in Toledo, on the morning of the 11th and by a Dr. Nickels in the office of Dr. O'Donnell, the New York Central medical director at Detroit, on the 12th&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of December.  He was temporarily relieved from service until December 27th or 28th when he was advised at a meeting with the road foreman of engines and the local chairman of the union that he was permanently relieved from work as a fireman on the railroad.  Later, he received a letter telling him that &quot;they had diagnosed me as an epileptic.&quot; The petition alleges that the &quot;said C. H. O'Donnell, M. D., wrongfully and mistakenly claimed that plaintiff was an epileptic and made a diagnosis of epilepsy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 25, 1952, plaintiff consulted Dr. Hopple, a neurosurgeon in Toledo, who at that time &quot;took a complete history&quot; and &quot;did a complete general physical and neurological examination of him&quot; at his office, later sending the plaintiff to a hospital for 12 days' examination in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Hopple's report to the local representative of the brotherhood refers to &quot;several episodes of blacking out&quot; during the preceding five years and his final diagnosis was &quot;syncope [fainting] probably associated with hypoglycemia [low sugar count].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August 1952, by mutual agreement between Dr. O'Donnell, the chief surgeon for the railroad, and Dr. Hopple, selected by the brotherhood, Dr. Gurdjian, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a neurosurgeon in Detroit, was selected as &quot;a third neutral doctor to carry out an examination and express an opinion about the employee's ability to return to his regular work.&quot; Mr. Ryan, general chairman of the locomotive engineers for that area, testified that the procedure of having Dr. Gurdjian examine the plaintiff &quot;went further than the rules required.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff spent about two weeks in Grace Hospital in Detroit in September 1952 for this last examination, and the report and recommendation of Dr. Gurdjian was that plaintiff &quot;should not work on machinery or other moving vehicles because of the possibility of injury to himself as well as to others.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From December 1951 on there were numerous conferences between railroad and brotherhood representatives, finally reaching the stage where Mr. Peterson (Assistant General Manager for Labor Relations) was representing the railroad and Mr. Ryan, general chairman of the brotherhood, was representing plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the report by Dr. Gurdjian, Mr. Peterson, as &quot;the chief operating officer of the carrier designated to handle such disputes&quot; (see Section 153 (i), Title 45, U.S. Code, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">infra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), disqualified plaintiff from further&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  service as a fireman on the basis of physical disability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 1956, plaintiff instituted his action against the railroad, claiming damages for alleged breach of contract.  Paragraph number 6 of the petition states:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Plaintiff says that his disqualification by the defendant was in direct violation of his contract of employment; that plaintiff has accepted his disqualification by the defendant as a final discharge; that he is no longer an employee of the defendant and that he is bringing this action against the defendant for breach of said contract of employment by the defendant and for wrongful dismissal and permanent disqualification from service.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff then alleges loss of earnings up to the time of filing suit in the amount of $ 20,000 and future wage impairment and loss of earnings in the sum of approximately $ 105,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer of the railroad, filed in January 1957, admits and denies certain pleadings of plaintiff and sets up rule 9 of the agreement between the brotherhood and the railroad.  In plaintiff's reply filed in September 1957, the full set of rules, regulations and requirements between the brotherhood and the railroad governing physical examinations&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is set forth and attached as part of the reply.  The plaintiff alleges in his reply that defendant railroad wrongfully and fraudulently violated these rules, regulations and requirements, causing plaintiff, &quot;to be wrongfully discharged by defendant and wrongfully disqualified from further service by defendant as set forth in plaintiff's petition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon submission of all the issues to the jury, a lump-sum verdict was returned in the amount of $ 50,000, for which judgment was rendered, and upon appeal the judgment was affirmed by a divided court.  No written opinion was rendered in either the trial court or the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant employer challenged the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Lucas County (Ohio), which affirmed a lower court's judgment entering a jury verdict was in favor of appellee employee in his action for wrongful discharge and violation of the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. The employer claimed that the employee failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as required by the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C.S. &sect; 151 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After the employee, a railroad fireman, developed health problems, the employer, a railroad company, required a medical evaluation. When the employee was diagnosed with epilepsy, the employer terminated him. The employee filed an action for wrongful discharge and breach of the collective bargaining agreement. A jury verdict was entered in favor of the employee, and the appellate court affirmed the award. Upon a motion to certify the record, the court reversed, holding that the employee had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies under the Railway Labor Act. Although an action for wrongful discharge was available to the employee in state courts, the collective bargaining agreement provided that an employment dispute be settled in accordance with the Railway Labor Act. The Act first required the employee to appeal to the National Railroad Adjustment Board and the state required that the employee first exhaust his administrative remedies. Because he did not do so, the jury award was improper, and the matter was remanded with directions to enter judgment in favor of the employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court, and it rendered judgment in favor of the employer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case is concerned with newly enacted Section 5501.112, Revised Code, and with an agreement created thereunder.  The design of Section 5501.112, Revised Code, and of any agreements created thereunder is to provide a method for financing the cost of the advance acquisition of land to be used for highway purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 103rd General Assembly enacted Section 3309.151, Revised Code, empowering the School Employees Retirement Board to use its funds to purchase real property located within the state for the purpose of resale to the Department of Highways.  Such a purchase is authorized if the board has entered into an agreement with the Departmment of Highways pursuant to newly enacted Section 5501.112, Revised Code, which is contained in the chapter entitled &quot;Department of Highways.&quot; This section deals with the acquisition, use, and resale of such property.  It sets forth the terms which must be contained in such agreements and empowers the Director of Highways to purchase in advance property which he deems will be necessary for the improvement of the state highway system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to such sections the Director of Highways entered into an agreement with the School Employees&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Retirement Board wherein the director, as agent for the retirement board, is to negotiate the purchase of certain real property which he deems will be necessary for the improvement of the state highway system.  The director has negotiated the purchase of such real property and the board has drawn a requisition upon the respondent Treasurer of State as custodian of the board's funds.  Respondent refused to honor the requisition, whereupon this original action in mandamus was instituted in this court.  Respondent treasurer has filed his answer setting up various constitutional objections to the statute and the agreement.  The relator has filed a demurrer to the answer, and the cause is presently before the court upon the pleadings.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Relator state highway director sought mandamus to force respondent state treasurer to release funds to pay for the purchase of highway rights of way pursuant to Ohio Rev.

A debt was not created because an appropriation existed to support the original agreement concerning the purchase, the agreement required a new appropriation before the agreement could be renewed and it required the obtaining of a certificate of availability of funds in compliance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 131.17, the agreement's two-year limitation satisfied Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5501.112, and subsequent legislatures were not bound by the agreement. The expenditure for relator's advance acquisition of highway rights of way constituted an economically sound and reasonable expenditure for a statutory highway purpose and the fact that the acquisition was made before the actual contract letting for the improvement did not prevent the transaction from being properly characterized as an expenditure for a statutory highway purpose.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action arose as a result of defendant, appellant herein, being charged with certain parking violations contrary to the ordinances of the city of Columbus.  A plea of not guilty was entered by defendant.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the trial, no evidence was introduced that defendant parked the automobile, the prosecution relying on the provisions of a city ordinance that, where an automobile is found illegally parked and the identity of the driver cannot be determined, the person in whose name such vehicle is registered is prima facie responsible for the violation.  Defendant introduced no evidence but moved that the charges be dismissed on the grounds that the ordinance is unconstitutional and that the prosecution had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had committed the offenses.  The court upheld the validity of the ordinance, overruled defendant's motion and found defendant guilty.  The defendant appealed to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Court of Common Pleas where the judgment was affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged with parking offenses, in violation of Col. Mun. Code &sect; 27.334. In the municipal court, defendant moved that the charges be dismissed on the grounds that the ordinance was unconstitutional and that the prosecution had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had committed the offenses. The municipal court overruled the motion and found defendant guilty. Defendant appealed to the court of common pleas and to the lower court, both of which affirmed the judgment of the municipal court. Defendant sought further review. On review, the court found that Ohio Const. Art XVIII, &sect; 3 gave municipalities the power to enact and enforce local police regulations that were not in conflict with general laws. The court concluded that a municipality, in those instances in which the identity of a parking violator could not be determined, might make the owner of the motor vehicle prima facie responsible for its being illegally parked without proof that such owner parked the vehicle himself or that it was parked with his knowledge and consent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case involves the valuation, for purposes of taxation, of real estate with improvements thereon located in Hamilton County and known as the Kenwood Plaza Shopping Center.

After a hearing at which evidence was presented, the Board of Revision refused to reduce the valuation.</SPAN></P>

The board of elections contended that the last paragraph of Ohio Rev.

The court disagreed and held that the statutory provision was unconstitutional because it was in direct conflict with Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 13, which mandated the election of a successor to fill the deceased judge's unexpired term. As there was a patent and obvious conflict between the constitutional provision and the statutory provision, the rule of statutory construction that acts of the Ohio General Assembly were presumed valid and that it was mandatory to resolve all doubt in favor of their validity did not apply.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief was instituted in the Common Pleas Court of Cuyahoga County by plaintiff appellee, the owner of real estate improved for business purposes and located on Lake Shore Boulevard in Cleveland between Marcella Avenue and Neff Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant appellees are also owners of real estate improved for business purposes and located on or adjacent to the same part of Lake Shore Boulevard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This part of Lake Shore Boulevard is located and represents about one-fourth of the 7/10 mile between Nottingham and Windward Roads.  The portion of Lake Shore Boulevard between Nottingham and Windward Roads had been zoned for general retail business in 1929 by defendant-appellant, the city of Cleveland.  In 1945, this portion of Lake Shore Boulevard was rezoned for multifamily residences so as to make any then existing use for general retail business a nonconforming use.  In 1949, the zoning ordinance was further amended so as to restrict the enlargement or expansion of nonconforming uses and so as to provide for their elimination under certain circumstances or conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Common Pleas&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Court (through Judge Bell, now a member of this court) held these amendments to the zoning ordinance unconstitutional and enjoined their enforcement so far as they purport to restrict the improvement or use of property located on this portion of Lake Shore Boulevard differently than it had been restricted by the original 1929 zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal to the Court of Appeals on law and fact, that court denied relief to those who had not asked for it and to those whose properties had not been substantially improved for business purposes prior to the foregoing 1945 amendments to the zoning ordinance.  As a result, its judgment gave relief such as had been given by the Common Pleas Court only to the plaintiff appellee and the defendant appellees, hereinafter collectively referred to as the appellees, who were the only parties who had sought relief and owned properties so substantially improved for business purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That judgment of the Court of Appeals was reversed by this court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On remand to the Court of Appeals, that court found &quot;upon reconsideration of all of the evidence in the case&quot; that &quot;the amendatory ordinances * * * when applied to the properties&quot; of appellees &quot;are confiscatory, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  unreasonable and discriminatory and without relation to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare and are unconstitutional as to&quot; their properties; and &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">permanently enjoined</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; Cleveland &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">from any action or conduct tending to interfere with the use and enjoyment of said premises in the same manner and to the same extent as they were, or could have been used and enjoyed prior to the adoption of said amendatory ordinances</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city filed in this court an appeal as of right from that judgment of the Court of Appeals (claiming a constitutional question), and also filed a motion requesting this court to certify the record to this court for review.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The zoning ordinance was amended to restrict the enlargement or expansion of nonconforming uses and to provide for their elimination under certain circumstances or conditions. The record disclosed that appellees were the owners of substantially improved lands and that a substantial actual loss in value resulted from the rezoning of these lands by the amendments to the zoning ordinance. The evidence was sufficient to justify the conclusion that the decisions, which the legislative body was presumed to have made, were clearly erroneous. The evidence disclosed that appellees' properties had a substantially lesser value because of the use restrictions imposed by the amendatory ordinances. However, the injunction imposed by the lower court was too broad as it would have even prevented the enforcement of any future valid amendatory ordinance to appellees. The judgment was therefore modified to enjoin the enforcement only of the portions of the amendments complained of in the suit. As modified, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff next alleges that the authorities of the city of Columbus have &quot;insisted&quot; that plaintiff include in his individual income tax return to the city of Columbus the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  income received as rents from his Columbus real estate, alleges that he has exhausted his administrative remedies in &quot;endeavoring to convince&quot; the municipal taxing authorities that said rents are not subject to the income tax, alleges that he is threatened with &quot;civil and/or criminal proceedings&quot; to enforce such payment by him, and alleges that he &quot;desires&quot; to pay the taxes levied by the ordinances referred to if he is legally liable therefor.  Plaintiff sets forth five conclusions of law to which he asks the court to subscribe and prays further for an order permanently enjoining the municipal officials from commencing or maintaining any action to enforce the income tax ordinance against him.  To the extent necessary for present purposes, the propositions for which the plaintiff prays support appear hereinafter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conclusions of the Court of Common Pleas were directly contrary to those set forth by the plaintiff, the court finding that the rents from the Columbus properties are subject to the tax, and that they are not exempted therefrom for any of the statutory or constitutional reasons suggested in the amended petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant owner challenged the decision of the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio), which affirmed a judgment for appellee city finding that the rents from the owner's properties within the city were subject to tax, and that they were not exempted therefrom.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owner held certain property within the city, although he lived in another municipality. The city enacted ordinances which established and levied a city income tax. The owner argued that the rent from his city properties could not be taxed as income by the city. The court affirmed. The owner's activities fell squarely within the definition of &quot;business&quot; in the ordinance. Net rentals received by an owner of real estate within the city from properties let by him under such circumstances were included within the term &quot;net profits&quot; as that term was defined by ordinance. Where real property within a municipality was rented under such circumstances as to constitute a doing of business under the terms of an ordinance levying a municipal income tax, the rentals were subject to such tax as net profits from the operation of a business. Rents received by the owner, a nonresident, from real estate located within the city were subject to the income tax, not exempt from such tax by reason of any pre-emption by the state, not exempt from such tax by Ohio statutes, not exempt from such tax by virtue of the state constitution, and not exempt from such tax by implication of the laws of Ohio.</SPAN></P>
