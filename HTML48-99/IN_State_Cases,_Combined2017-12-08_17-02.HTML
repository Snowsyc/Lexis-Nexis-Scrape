<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff student filed a declaratory judgment action against defendant Indiana High School Athletic Association, Inc. (IHSAA), claiming that the IHSAA's rules were unconstitutional. The student sought to enjoin the IHSAA from prohibiting the student from participating in interscholastic sports. The Jasper Circuit Court (Indiana) held in favor of the student. The IHSAA appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a junior, the student played high school basketball. The high school was a member of the IHSAA. During the spring of his junior year, the student withdrew from school because he had a serious sinus infection. The student had received poor grades during the fall semester because of the sinus infection. As such, the high school permitted him to repeat his junior year. However, the IHSAA forbade him to play basketball during his repeated junior year under a rule which limited athletic eligibility to the eight semesters of high school and provided that after being enrolled 16 or more school days in each of 4 fall semesters, a student was ineligible for further participation. The IHSAA denied him relief under a rule, providing that the 16 days were not counted if the student withdrew from school due to a serious illness. The court held that the IHSAA was engaged in state action, but that there was no violation of procedural due process. However, the court found that the student did not repeat his junior year coursework in an attempt to gain an advantage in sports competition. As such, the court held that not allowing the student to play was arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted respondents' motion to dismiss, holding that absent an allegation of grounds for contest under Indiana's election contest statute,&nbsp;Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate filed a complaint seeking a recount of all votes cast in all districts and precincts in a mayoral election. He also sought to contest the election on the basis of fraud and irregularities and misconduct by the people associated with the election process. The winning nominee moved to dismiss, asserting that the candidate's complaint was jurisdictionally defective because it was not properly verified and it failed to allege the required statutory grounds for contesting an election. The candidate responded that if the election statute precluded election contests on grounds of fraud, it would unconstitutionally deny him due process under both the Indiana and United States Constitutions. The court held that: (1) it would appear that the legislature by its 1988 amendments to the election statute removed fraud as a ground for contesting the results of an election; (2) however, the election belonged to the sovereign people and the legislature had to stay within its constitutional powers; and (3) therefore, the candidate was entitled to be accorded the opportunity to challenge fraud in the conduct of the primary election, although quo warranto was not available.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A neighbor found the child shackled to his bed. Defendants were tried and convicted of cruelly confining the child, pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-46-1-4. On defendants' appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court determined that &sect; 35-46-1-4 made it a crime to confine a dependent cruelly, and that a statute was not unconstitutionally vague if individuals of ordinary intelligence comprehended it adequately. The court had amply defined &quot;cruelly&quot; in its rulings, and that, applying the standards, the statute was constitutional. Although defendants claimed they were only punishing the child and there was no mens rea, the court applied an objective standard of cruelty. Defendant father claimed he was out of the house under arrest for two days and challenged the sufficiency of the evidence against him, however, based on the test for sufficiency of the evidence, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence was overwhelmingly sufficient to sustain his conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Indiana's Code a mutual drain was convertible into a regulated drain only if: (1) The owners of more than 50 percent in acreage of the affected land would have been benefited if the drain was made a regulated drain under this chapter; and (2) The benefit to owners benefited was likely to have been greater than the damages to owners damaged by reason of the mutual drain being made a regulated drain. The court affirmed, finding that more than 50 percent of the affected land was benefited as the drain affected more than 36 acres, and most of those acres were benefited by the regulated drain. There was no requirement that the adjoining property owners own more than 50 percent of the land benefited. The court held that the affected area did not include lakes and the drain converted was a mutual drain. Finally, the court held that Ind. Code &sect; 36-9-27-19(c) was not constitutionally defective as it provided fair warning of the criteria by which petitions were considered and that the establishment of a regulated drain was not an unconstitutional taking of property.</SPAN></P>

The administratrix filed a cross-appeal challenging both the reduction of the jury's award of damages from $ 937,000 to $ 500,000 and the constitutionality of the Indiana Medical Malpractice Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One day after the administratrix filed her medical malpractice complaint against the hospital for the wrongful death of decedent, she filed an identical complaint with state's medical review panel (panel) for it to render an opinion, notwithstanding that the Indiana Medical Malpractice Act (Act), Ind.

However, the hospital neglected to file any motion challenging the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction until over two years later, by which time the panel had concluded that the hospital had failed to comply with the appropriate standard of care. The administratrix then filed a motion to reinstate the original complaint with the trial court which was granted and after a trial, the jury awarded damages in the amount of $ 937,000. Upon the hospital's motion, the trial court reduced the judgment to $ 500,000, the cap provided under the Act. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that under the peculiar facts of the case, the motion to reinstate constituted a refiling of the complaint. On the cross-appeal, the court affirmed the constitutionality of the Act.</SPAN></P>

He argued, among other things, that the chain of custody for evidence used for deoxyribonucleic acid identification was broken by a laboratory technician's failure to testify, that his convictions for confinement and robbery violated double jeopardy, and that his sentence was manifestly unreasonable. The court found that the testimony of a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent was sufficient to establish chain of custody in the face of a challenge raising only the mere possibility of tampering, substitution, or alteration. The separate convictions for robbery and confinement did not violate double jeopardy because the charging instruments broke down the separate acts of the confinements and the robberies with specificity. The robberies were effectuated by putting the victims in fear, and the confinements were not co-extensive with the robberies. The court did not find the sentences to be manifestly unreasonable in light of the nature of the offenses and the risk that defendant would repeat the offenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff barge owner appealed the decision of the Jennings Circuit Court (Indiana) entering summary judgment for defendants, city, county, captain of a sheriff's department, marine service, and its owner, in his action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for the return and repair of his barge after the city removed it from a riverbank.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The barge was beached on the city's riverbank and remained there for several months. The city became concerned that the barge posed a safety hazard, but it was unable to find the owner of the barge. The city contracted with the marine service and its owner to remove the barge. Later, the barge owner took the barge from the marine service's facility. The captain of the sheriff's department arrested the barge owner for disorderly conduct. The barge owner filed a &sect; 1983 action for the return and repair of the barge against defendants. The barge owner also asked for punitive damages. The trial court granted summary judgment for defendants. The barge owner appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the barge owner was not entitled to punitive damages because the city and county were immune from such damages under &sect; 1983. Also, the marine service owner was acting pursuant to a contract with the city and the captain acted in the course of his duties as a member of the sheriff's department. The court found that the barge owner failed to show issues of material fact regarding a city or county policy or custom that caused a deprivation of his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the entry of partial summary judgment for defendants in the barge owner's &sect; 1983 action for the return and repair of his barge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with prostitution, a class A misdemeanor, and with being a class D felony habitual offender. Within the last 10 years of his arrest, defendant had been convicted nine times for prostitution. Two of the nine prostitution convictions were class D felonies. The trial court found defendant guilty of prostitution. It then determined that defendant was guilty of prostitution as a class D felony. Based upon evidence incorporated from the prior proceedings, the trial court held that defendant was a habitual class D felony offender and enhanced his three-year sentence by eight-years, pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-7.1. On appeal, the court noted that nothing in &sect; 35-50-2-7.1 prohibited incorporating evidence from the earlier phases of defendant's trifurcated trial. Thus, defendant failed to show that the evidence did not support the trial court's habitual offender finding. While enhancement on the basis of the nature of the present offense was not justified, defendant had a long history of prior offenses. Under the facts and circumstances, the court could not conclude that defendant's sentence was manifestly unreasonable or unconstitutionally disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

The arrestee contended on appeal that the trial court had discretion to order expungement of arrest records without specific statutory authority and that &sect; 35-38-5-1 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the trial court's order in favor of the state. The court found that &sect; 35-38-5-1 provided the only means for the expungement of arrest records. The court held that the trial court did not have the discretion to grant expungement of arrest records when the arrestee failed to meet his burden of proving that he fell within the provisions of &sect; 35-38-5-1.The court determined that &sect; 35-38-5-1 did not unconstitutionally distinguish between persons who had been wrongfully arrested and persons who had been acquitted after trial.

Defendant contended that the trial court erred in admitting statements that he made to the officer before the corpus delicti of the crime was established, but the court found that the evidence was sufficient to establish the corpus delicti of the crime. The court also rejected defendant's assertion that all the evidence gained as a result of his conversation with the officer was the product of an unlawful detention. Additionally, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction, that Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 9-11-2-1 and 9-11-4-5 were constitutional, that admission of exhibits related to the testing procedure did not violate defendant's rights to confrontation and cross-examination, and that there was no error in the trial court's instructions.</SPAN></P>

The father was ordered to pay child support and to pay all reasonable and necessary uninsured medical expenses for the child. The father filed a petition for modification of support alleging a substantial and continuing change in circumstances made the support order unreasonable. The trial court denied the petition. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The record indicated that the father was not voluntarily unemployed and his decline in income was not purposely brought about to reduce support payments. The trial court erred by considering the father's potential income when it determined whether modification of the support order was appropriate. There was no evidence that the father's loss of employment was temporary. The trial court could consider the father's assets to determine whether he had an ability to pay child support above what his income indicated under the Indiana Child Support Guidelines. The court indicated that the record supported a deviation from the guideline amount because the child spent substantially more time with the father than in the average case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 35-48-4-1, on its face, was unconstitutionally vague, and violated the substantive due process and equal protection guarantees of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, as well as Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, the constitutional guarantee of proportionality in sentencing; and that it was reversible error to allow prosecution witnesses to testify about what defendant's girlfriend said when he was arrested. The court could not say that the Class A felony enhancement of &sect; 35-48-4-1 was unconstitutionally vague. Ordinary people could understand that it was the overall rather than pure weight that counted, and there had been no showing that &sect; 35-48-4-1 lent itself to arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The court held that &sect; 35-48-4-1 was not unconstitutionally vague and did not offend the rights of due process and equal protection. Defendant did not cite any case on the meaning of Indiana's proportionality guarantee, so he waived the issue. The girlfriend denied making a statement, testifying instead that she had said the police were arresting the wrong person. There was nothing unfair or surprising to the witness.

The court noted that, although defendant had the burden to prove that the BAC results did not relate back to the time at which he had operated the vehicle, the jury should have been instructed that it was free to accept or reject the presumption even if defendant had not offered rebuttal evidence that he had consumed alcohol after the accident occurred and while waiting for help to arrive.</SPAN></P>

Both of the questions asked the witnesses to assume that there had been no trauma to the deceased and on of the questions contained other facts not in evidence. The court ruled that it could not usurp the jury's prerogative and reweigh the evidence. The court found no ground for reversal, concluding that the evidence, and the inferences which it reasonably supported, was sufficient to sustain the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father challenged the decision of the Marion County Superior Court (Indiana), which modified the father's child support obligation. The father contended that Ind. Code &sect; 31-1-11.5-12(b)(1), under which the father was ordered to pay for half of his child's college costs, was unconstitutional, and that the trial court erred in making the modification retroactive and in awarding such a substantial increase in support.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee wife filed a petition to modify child support. The trial court increased the support, made it retroactive, and ordered each party to pay half of the child's college expenses. The court affirmed the constitutionality of the law allowing the trial court to order the father to pay his daughter's college expenses. The law did not violate the equal protection or due process rights of the father. The father's liberty right was not absolute, but was tied to his right of control and legal custody of the child. A rational relationship existed between the law and the state's interest in seeing that the child was properly provided for within the father's financial means. The court remanded the issue of whether the father had to pay child support while the child lived on campus because the guidelines contemplated the avoidance of duplicative orders regarding a college student's living expenses. The trial court had the discretion to make a modification retroactive to the date of the petition. Also, the modification, while a substantial increase, was within the child support guidelines, and the father had made no showing that his standard of living would have been drastically reduced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the modification of child support by the father as modified by the court. The court remanded the issue of whether the father had to pay support while his child was living on a college campus. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the wife half of her appellate attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

The Johnson Circuit Court (Indiana) granted the city's motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In three &quot;phases&quot; under three separate ordinances, the City annexed certain property. Plaintiffs alleged that the ordinances were invalid as a matter of law because they did not contain a legal description of the corporate boundaries of the City, as required by Ind. Code &sect; 36-4-3-3. Plaintiffs further alleged that two of the ordinances unconstitutionally deprived them, and others similarly situated, representation in local government by failing to assign the annexed areas to councilmanic districts. In affirming the Circuit court's judgment, the court ruled that: (1) the ordinances' failure to include a definition of the City's corporate boundaries, under &sect; 36-4-3-3, was irrelevant because Ind. Code &sect; 36-4-3-4 also permitted annexation, and it did not require a definition of the municipality's corporate boundaries; and (2) plaintiffs lacked standing to assert representational challenges to the ordinances because they were not residents of districts that were not councilmanic and their claims, whether based upon remonstrance or declaratory judgment, were time barred because no action was filed to challenge the ordinances within the 60-day limit proscribed by Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from convictions for possessing and dealing cocaine near a school. The court held that defendant waived any objection to the admission of evidence of prior drug activity by failing to raise an objection at trial and that the state presented sufficient chain of custody evidence showing that the location of the cocaine was verified at all times. The court also ruled that penalty enhancement for the drug offense due to the proximity to the school did not constitute a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. The classification for high punishment did not involve a &quot;suspect class&quot; or fundamental rights and rationally effectuated the legislature's desires to afford special protection to children from the perils of drug trafficking and to provide harsher penalties for drug peddlers near schools. The court agreed with defendant that possession of cocaine was a lesser included offense of dealing in cocaine and that there was insufficient evidence of a second baggie of cocaine to support the possession charge. The court reversed and remanded the cocaine possession conviction with instructions to vacate the judgment. The remainder of the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred by finding that the three-year-old victim was competent to testify and abused its discretion by refusing to strike all of her testimony, that the trial court erred by allowing the victim's inconsistent testimony to remain in evidence, and that the trial court erred by allowing the victim's videotaped testimony to be admitted because he was unable to cross-examine the victim and the tape was of such poor quality. The court determined that the trial court struck most of the victim's testimony, except that which stated that she talked to a caseworker and that defendant touched her genital area. The court held that it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to allow the remaining testimony. The court also held that pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-37-4-6 the videotape was admissible without the necessity of defendant cross-examining the victim because Ind. Code &sect; 35-37-4-6 protected the victim from being subjected to cross-examination. The court concluded that the process was not unconstitutional.

Code &sect; 6-1.1-25-4, which, prior to 1988 provided for a two-year redemption period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purchasers claimed that the trial court erred in applying a pre-1988 version of &sect; 6-1.1-25-4. They claimed that the alleged property owner failed to redeem property sold at an October 8, 1987 tax sale within the period required by the amended statute. On review, the court agreed with the purchasers and reversed the grant of summary judgment. The 1988 amendment to the statute reduced the redemption period from two years to one year. A tax deed was issued to the purchasers on March 28, 1989. On May 17, 1989 they brought the quiet title action, and at that point, the alleged property owner attempted to redeem. The court found that the alleged property owner received sufficient notice of the tax sale, as required by Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-25-6 (1988). Moreover, the court rejected the claim of the alleged property owner that the redemption period was unlawfully extended by a county auditor when considering which version of redemption statute to apply. The court found that any extension was not harmful and was not a basis for further extending any redemption rights. The court held that application of the statute as amended in 1988 did not violate any constitutional or contract rights.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 35-34-1-2, which related to the particularity required of informations, did not violate due process. The court held that due process required reasonable notice, an opportunity for fair hearing, and the right to have a court of competent jurisdiction hear one's cause, and that the two statutes did not violate any of the enumerated requirements. The court held that the information sufficiently apprised defendant for alibi purposes that he was being tried for an offense occurring around a certain date. If defendant had raised an alibi defense, the prosecutor was required to provide a more specific date, and this was an adequate procedure by which defendant could raise an alibi defense.

R. Trial P. 12(B)(6). The citizen had also sought a declaration that Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 9-4-1-25 and 36-8-3-6 were unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen sought to recover for injuries sustained in a high-speed police chase. He alleged that a roadblock set up by police was unreasonable because the chase was unjustified. The circuit court held for defendants. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court properly dismissed the &sect; 1983 complaint. Only roadblocks designed to cause death or serious bodily injury were sufficiently unreasonable to invoke &sect; 1983 liability. The citizen did not allege that the roadblock was so designed. He merely claimed that any roadblock used to stop him was unreasonable because there was no reason for the stop. He also claimed that the town and county were liable for failing to adequately train the police to prevent a deprivation of his constitutional rights. Also, the trial court correctly dismissed the personal injury claim. The court rejected the citizen's contention that he was subject to false arrest or imprisonment and that, as a result, defendants' immunity was at issue. The citizen was guilty of resisting arrest, thus, he was not subject to false arrest or imprisonment, as a matter of law and defendants were immune. In addition, Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 9-4-1-25 and 36-8-3-6 were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants brought an action to challenge voting provision of the Indiana Code.

Those voters who moved to a new precinct within the same county and who failed to file a timely transfer request could only vote for President and Vice President. The trial court held that the challenged provisions did not violate either the state constitution or the federal constitution. On appeal, the court reversed and determined that the challenged provisions violated the Equal Protection Clause of the federal constitution. The court held that the proper standard of review was strict scrutiny because the right to vote was a fundamental right.

The court concluded that &sect; 29-1-2-7(b) reflected a careful balance of the State's interest with the illegitimate child's interest and that the statute's five month limitation did not violate the equal protection clause. The court found that, in denying the paternity action, the trial court interpreted &sect; 29-1-2-7(b) to prohibit all paternity actions for any purpose when they were commenced more than five months after the alleged father's death. The court concluded that trial court erred in dismissing the paternity complaint because the five-month limit affected an action only to the extent that it sought to establish a right of inheritance and did not effect the child's other possible claims.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court because the mother failed to present evidence that there had been a substantial and continuing change in the custodial home that was detrimental to the child in any way. Although the trial judge overstepped his authority in interrogating the mother and her husband about their church attendance, and by expressing his religious requirements for a custodial parent, the mother failed to present substantial evidence that was sufficient to permit the judge to exercise his discretion to change the custody award.</SPAN></P>

PERF appealed, and the trial court granted the motion by PERF for a stay of judgment. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for modification of the trial court's QDRO. The court found no supersedure or implied repeal of the PERF statutes. The court held that PERF was not obligated to comply with those portions of the trial court's order that were inconsistent with the PERF statutes. The court ordered the trial court to enter a conforming order because the PERF statutes and the marital dissolution statutes could be harmoniously construed. The court reasoned that the marital dissolution statute had offered the trial court a method of distribution, by setting aside a percentage of the payments either by assignment or in kind at the time of receipt, which was not in violation of the PERF statutes against assignment and attachment.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 34-1-1-2 (1988), against appellant tortfeasor after the decedent was killed in an automobile accident. The tortfeasor admitted liability, so the issue before the Lake Superior Court, Civil Division (Indiana) was solely the amount of damages due to the decedent's estate. The tortfeasor sought view of the damage award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties did not dispute the testimony regarding the decedent's life expectancy, personal characteristics, future lost earnings, and future lost household services. The tortfeasor argued that the expert economist's testimony valuing the decedent's life should not have been admitted because it was not an aid to the jury in valuing the loss of affection and love to the husband and the loss of parental training and guidance to the children. The court agreed. The court found that Ind. Code &sect; 34-1-1-2 (1988) limited the measure of damages for a wrongful death action to compensation for the pecuniary loss sustained by the plaintiffs in the action, and that damages for the estimated value of the life lost were not recoverable. The court concluded that because the jury was able to determine the loss of affection, love, parental training, and guidance from its own experiences and through the testimony of the survivors, the expert's testimony regarding these losses invaded the province of the jury. The court found that questions regarding annuities and the cost of annuities was relevant to determining the present value of damages and should have been admitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of a police investigation, the informant hired defendant for a $ 150 &quot;fantasy session.&quot; During the session, defendant performed a &quot;bed dance&quot; while disrobing over the informant. For an additional $ 50, defendant inserted a flesh-colored penis-shaped object into her anus. Thereafter, defendant was convicted of prostitution, pursuant to &sect; 35-45-4-2. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 35-45-4-2 was not void for vagueness because the statute placed defendant on notice that an agreement to perform deviate sexual conduct for money was prohibited. Moreover, Ind. Code &sect; 35-41-1-9 (1988) specifically included anal insertion within the definition of &quot;deviate sexual conduct.&quot; Further, &sect; 35-45-4-2 was not unconstitutionally overbroad because it was the blatant commercialization of sexual conduct that was subject to legislative censure as opposed to the autoerotic conduct itself. Additionally, &sect; 35-45-4-2 furthered the substantial governmental interest of protecting the public order, safety, and welfare. Thus, &sect; 35-45-4-2 could constitutionally be applied to defendant's non-obscene performance. Finally, sufficient evidence supported defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court held that even if the instruction, which defendant argued should have been given regarding the guilty but mentally ill verdict, had been tendered, it was not a correct statement of the law and refusal of the tendered instruction would not have been error.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a personal injury action, plaintiff sought review of the judgment of the Floyd Superior Court (Indiana), which ruled that New Albany, Indiana, Ordinance &sect; 116, relating to warning lights and devices on ice cream trucks was invalid because it was in conflict with Ind. Code &sect; 9-8-6-29. The judgment complained of was rendered in plaintiff's action alleging defendants' ice cream truck was not in compliance with the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was struck by a car as she crossed the street to buy ice cream from defendants' truck. Plaintiff argued that defendants were negligent in that their truck failed to comply with the ordinance's requirements for warning lights and devices that would have warned defendant car driver to be alert for pedestrians. The trial court ruled that the ordinance was invalid because it conflicted with the state statute regulating vehicle warning lights. Plaintiff appealed. The court found that the city had authority to adopt the ordinance so long as the ordinance did not conflict with statutory provisions. The court found further that the ordinance's warning light provision requiring alternating flashing red lights on the front of ice cream trucks conflicted with the statute requiring that warning lights on the front of vehicles be white or amber, and permitting flashing red lights only on emergency vehicles. The court concluded, however, that the trial court erred in invalidating the entire ordinance because the ordinance also required safety measures other than the flashing lights, and the latter portion of the ordinance was severable, complete, and capable of execution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court judgment that invalidated the entire ordinance relating to safety provisions, warning lights, and devices applicable to ice cream trucks.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, Ind. Code &sect; 9-11-2. On appeal, the court reviewed the challenged jury instruction concerning the evidentiary effect of defendant's blood alcohol content (BAC) test and concluding that the instruction was irrefutably mandatory in that it failed to inform the jury that they have a choice or might infer the desired conclusion. Nowhere in the challenged instruction or the charge as a whole did the trial court inform the jury that the presumption of BAC at the time of operation was rebuttable, therefore, the presumption created by the instruction was conclusive as well as mandatory. However, the erroneous instruction did not compare with the kinds of errors that automatically required the reversal of an otherwise valid conviction so the court first considered the entire record to determine if the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Because the record indicated conflicting evidence of defendant's intoxication, the erroneous instruction could not be considered harmless. The conviction was reversed, and the case was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the conviction. Given the inconclusive nature of the evidence of appearance of intoxication and the conflicting opinion of the bartender that defendant did not appear intoxicated, the court was unable to conclude that the constitutionally infirm instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child had been killed while the custodial parent was visiting the home of the tortfeasor and the child was negligently shot and killed by the tortfeasor's son. The issue was whether a divorced non-custodial parent had standing to bring an action for the wrongful death of a minor child under Ind. Code &sect; 34-1-1-8. On review, the court reversed and remanded, holding that &sect; 34-1-1-8 conferred standing upon a non-custodial parent. The court found that, when looked at as a whole, the statute clearly intended that a non-custodial parent be entitled to compensation for the wrongful death or injury of their child. The court also found that both parents were liable for the medical and funeral bills of a child because of their common law, and in some instances statutory, duty to support and maintain their children. The court determined that the apportionment of damages for loss of a child's services and a child's love and affection is a question of fact to be determined at trial or between the parents. The court concluded that there was no rational basis for denying a non-custodial parent standing to recover for loss occasioned by the injury or death of a child.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered an order changing custody to the father based on its finding that it was in the best interest of the daughter. On appeal by the mother, the court reversed the order because the wrong standard was used by the court. The court found that generally it was in a child's best interest to require a substantial and continuing change in circumstances before modifying a custody order. Therefore, in a custody modification proceeding arising out of a paternity action under Ind. Code &sect; 31-6-6.1-11(e), the petitioning party had to have demonstrated a substantial and continuing change in circumstances so as to make the existing custody order unreasonable under Ind. Code &sect; 31-1-11.5-22(d). Section &sect; 31-1-11.5-22(d) applied to modification cases arising out of marriage dissolution. Because the mother was caring for the daughter with the help of the grandmother, a substantial and continuing change in circumstances warranting a change of custody did not exist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a buyer of real estate at a tax-sale, challenged a judgment of the Marion Superior Court (Indiana), which denied the buyer's motion for summary judgment in the buyer's action to quiet title in the property. The trial court granted the owner's motion for summary judgment summary judgment in the owner's counterclaim to declare the tax-sale void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of the tax-sale, Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-25-4 (1982) provided a two-year period in which the owner could redeem the land. Pub. L. No. 89-1987, &sect; 5 (Ind.) reduced the redemption period to one year. The owner received a notice of tax sale redemption but did not redeem the property, and the county auditor issued a tax deed to the buyer. In the buyer's action to quiet title, the trial court found that Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-25-4 (1982) granted the owner a contract right to redeem the property for two years and the application of the reduced one-year redemption period was an unconstitutional impairment of the owner's contract rights. On appeal, the court disagreed and held that the 1987 amendment did not violate the contract clauses of U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10 and Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 24. The right of redemption did not create a contractual right but was a remedy accorded by the state as a matter of grace. Thus, the state legislature could constitutionally shorten the redemption period after the tax-sale occurred. Because the owner did not have a vested right in a two-year redemption period, there was no unconstitutional taking when the redemption period was shortened to one year.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the action with instructions to enter judgment for the buyer in its quiet title action and against the owner on his counterclaim to declare the tax-sale void.</SPAN></P>

The solid waste transporter was required to get a solid waste permit under Ind. Admin.

It was transferring solid waste from one vehicle or container through its building to another vehicle or container for transportation. The court rejected the solid waste transporter's claim that Ind. Admin. Code &sect; 2-8-1 was unconstitutionally vague because it gave fair notice of who needed a permit when interpreted. The public interest exception to the rule that estoppel did not ordinarily apply to the government was inapplicable because the public policy of protecting the citizenry by disallowing any facility which contributes to pollution without prior approval outweighed the solid waste transporter's economic interest.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) any delays caused by defendants' acts extended the one-year time limitation by the length of such delays, including any failures to object to the delays; (2) defendants had no standing to challenge the search of their mother's home because they had no reasonable expectation of privacy in a home that they were merely visiting; and (3) absent bad faith on the part of police, the failure to preserve fingerprints or other evidence did not constitute a due process violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer entered the corporation's bookstore and purchased two books from the seller. Both books were fictional, contained no photographs, and did not state the age of the characters.

On appeal, the court held that defendants failed to rebut the presumption that &sect; 35-49-3-1(2) was constitutional. The trial court concluded that the content of a book proffered for comparison was substantially similar to the two books purchased. However, defendants failed to establish community acceptance of the comparative book or to show that they were prejudiced by its exclusion from evidence. The evidence was sufficient to support the conviction because the state was not required to submit expert testimony in an obscenity case. In affirming, the court held that an obscenity determination could be based solely on the jury's view of the allegedly offensive material. The enhancement portion of the statute applied even to fictional characters, and the jury could conclude that the books' characters were under 16 years of age.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee injured party brought an action against appellant tortfeasor for injuries he inflicted upon her in a battery. Even though aware of the trial date, as evident from a call from the trial judge, the tortfeasor failed to appear. The Grant Circuit Court (Indiana) entered a default judgment for the injured party and awarded her $ 98,423.90 in actual damages and $ 198,757.80 punitive damages. The tortfeasor sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tortfeasor had been represented by several attorneys, all of whom withdrew for one reason or another. After the tortfeasor failed to appear for the trial, the trial judge said he was going to enter a default judgment, but evidence was received on the merits as well. In rejecting the tortfeasor's argument that the trial judge was required to give him three days notice under Ind. R. Trial P. 55(B) before entering a default judgment, the court held that even though the trial judge had referred to it as a default judgment, it was in fact a judgment on the merits and the requirements of the rule did not apply. The court then concluded that the tortfeasor's failure to appear constituted a waiver of right to a jury trial under Ind. R. Trial P. 38(D). The award of damages was not so outrageous as to indicate that the trial judge was motivated by passion, prejudice, partiality, or the consideration of improper evidence. The court determined that the double jeopardy clause did not apply to a case between two private litigants, so it was irrelevant that the tortfeasor had pleaded guilty to a battery in connection with the tort and was fined $ 1 and given a 60-day suspended sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and her lover murdered defendant's husband. Defendant later escaped from custody. Evidence of her escape and of her possession of a handgun were admitted as relevant to the consciousness of her guilt. The court affirmed on appeal, finding that the trial court's granting of defendant's motion in limine was not violated. This was so because the ruling only excluded questioning any witness about prior or past criminal history, unrelated charges, or difficulties with the law which defendant might have had. The court further found that evidence of defendant's target practice and the husband's abuse of defendant were known to the State and admitted from sources other than the source protected through defendant's use immunity. Potential jurors who were farmers or who were self-employed were properly excused, due to the projected length of the trial. The court found that no evidentiary rulings were abuses of discretion and that conspiracy, as well as murder, were proved by overwhelming evidence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a modification order, which stated that the husband was in contempt of court for failure to pay $ 4,120 in child support, increased his monthly child support obligation, and ordered him to pay his eldest daughter's college expenses. The husband appealed. The court affirmed and held, inter alia, that: (1) in light of the evidence presented, the trial court's determination that a substantial change in circumstances had occurred was not illogical or unreasonable; (2) the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it used the Indiana Child Support Guidelines to determine the husband's support obligations; and (3) the statute authorizing the payment of educational expenses as child support, Ind.

On appeal of the BZA's denial of the petition, the trial court determined that the BZA's decision did not rest on a rational basis and was arbitrary and unreasonable. On further review, the court ruled that the trial court applied the proper standard of review. Rejecting appellants' claim that the trial court conducted a trial de novo in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 36-7-4-1009 because it admitted photographs and maps of the property into evidence, the court ruled that there was no trial de novo because the additional evidence concerned the same subjects covered at the BZA's hearing. As to appellants' claim that the trial court erred by failing to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the matter was res judicata based on the BZA's denial of an earlier petition that asked for identical relief, the court determined that the transcript of the hearing on the later petition contained no reservation of the res judicata question so that there was nothing before the trial court upon which it could act.</SPAN></P>

The printer later filed an action in Indiana against the author for failure to pay for printing services. The following pre-trial motions were filed and denied: a motion to dismiss by the author for lack of in personam jurisdiction, a motion for sanctions by the printer, and a motion for continuance by the author. Although the author failed to appear for trial, the trial court entered a judgment against him. The court affirmed the judgment and held that it had jurisdiction over the author pursuant to Ind. R.

The court found that the author's contacts with Indiana were significant, purposeful and of the type that made it reasonably foreseeable that he could be hailed into an Indiana court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord leased property with a clause that provided that it could disconnect utilities if the tenant failed to pay rent.

The landlord argued that the ordinances were unconstitutional. The court held that the prohibition against impairment of contracts had no application to the lease because the lease was entered after the ordinances were in force. The court also held that the ordinances were not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. Further, the prohibition against impairment of contracts did not restrict the exercise of the state's police power to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. The ordinances were necessary and reasonable and a proper exercise of the municipality's police power. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The wholesaler and the distributor challenged the validity of Rule 28. The court held that the commission could not enact any rule that exceeded its statutory authority.

A doctor testified that the child's injury was treatable and, had it been promptly treated, she could have recovered. The trial court convicted defendant of neglect of a dependent as a class B felony. The court affirmed and held that the evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion that defendant had deprived her dependent daughter of support and that the deprivation of support resulted in the death of the dependent.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Delaware Superior Court No. 1 (Indiana) reflecting a jury verdict finding him guilty of burglary, a Class B felony, and attempted rape, a Class A felony. The superior court denied defendant's motions to exclude evidence discovered in a search and to make an offer of proof of his past sexual activity with the victim pursuant to the rape shield statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 35-37-4-4(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant broke into a victim's home, took her pistol, and used it to force her onto her bed. In a struggle while they were undressed, defendant received a gunshot and left in a car that contained the pistol, blood stained gloves, and blood samples. The superior court correctly admitted the evidence from within the car. The court upheld the verdict because it was supported by substantial evidence of probative value. The court determined that the detective obtained valid consent to search the car as required by the U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court held that the detective reasonably believed that the employer possessed common authority over the car for two reasons. First, defendant stated that the car belonged to a company and its registration named his employer. Second, the detective obtained written consent from the employer to search the car and the employer failed to mention defendant's exclusive possession and control of the car. The superior court correctly denied defendant's motion to offer proof of his past sexual history with the victim because it was tendered on the day of trial and Ind. Code &sect; 35-37-4-4(c)(1) required that it be tendered not less than 10 days before trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for erratic driving and arrested after the officer smelled a strong odor of alcohol coming from defendant's car. A blood alcohol content (BAC) test conducted at 1:55 a.m., 25 minutes after the stop, revealed a BAC of .10 percent. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court's jury instruction that allowed the jury to presume that defendant had a .10 percent at the time he operated the vehicle created a mandatory presumption which was unconstitutional because it shifted to him the burden of proof upon an element of the crime, his BAC at the time of the offense. The court held that the instruction, which paralleled the language of Ind. Code &sect; 9-11-4-15(b) (Cum. Supp. 1990), did not create a conclusive presumption or shift the burden of proof to defendant. It was not unconstitutional because it was permissible to place the burden on defendant to establish facts that would mitigate his culpability for a crime. The court reversed, however, because the instruction failed to advise the jury of its right to reject the presumption, and was thus subject to a mandatory interpretation which could have misled the jury with regard to its duty and prerogatives.</SPAN></P>

The county child services agency took steps to terminate defendant's parental rights, and she was convicted of neglect of a dependent. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction because it found that defendant's statements to the caseworker that the boyfriend abused the child were made only in response to threats made by the caseworker, indicating that defendant's parental rights could be terminated if she failed to cooperate. The totality of the circumstances suggested that defendant's statements were made under compulsion. The state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant's statements constituted a voluntary confession. The trial court erred in admitting evidence of defendant's comments concerning her suspicions of the boyfriend because such evidence violated defendant's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Carroll Superior Court (Indiana) convicted defendant of operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content greater than .10 percent in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 9-11-2-1 (1988). He appealed and asserted that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. He also argued that the statutory presumption of intoxication found in Ind. Code &sect; 9-11-4-15(b) (1988) impermissibly shifted the burden of proof from the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer stopped defendant for speeding. The officer administered a field sobriety test, which defendant failed. A breath test administered at the police station, within three hours of defendant's arrest, revealed a blood alcohol content of .13 percent. Based on that reading, defendant was presumed, pursuant to &sect; 9-11-4-15(b), to have been driving with at least .10 percent alcohol in his blood. On appeal, defendant argued that &sect; 9-11-4-15(b) was unconstitutional because it relieved the State from proving his blood alcohol content at the time of the offense and put the burden of proving a lower blood alcohol content on him. The court rejected defendant's error claims. Section 9-11-4-15(b) was constitutional; it merely shifted the burden of going forward. The State still had to prove all of the elements of the crime. The State had to prove all of the elements of &sect; 9-11-4-15(b) in order to raise the presumption. The breath tests were properly admitted. The State had not only presented defendant's breath test results, but had shown that the test was properly administered. The evidence fully supported the conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the revenue that ICVA received from the Capital Improvement Board of Managers of Marion County, Indiana (CIB) was 60-70 percent of ICVA's total revenue. The court concluded that by virtue of the receipt of the CIB funds to support and maintain the ICVA, the ICVA became an entity subject to audit by the Indiana State Board of Accounts.

Ind. Code &sect; 16-13-21-14.1, authorizing the location of group homes for developmentally disabled and mentally ill persons in single family residential subdivisions, did not violate due process and did not unconstitutionally impair the homeowners' contracts because it was a legitimate and narrowly drawn exercise of police power.

The store manager, who was not paying attention and did not realize what was going on, started to walk to the back room, and defendant shot him in the head. Defendant was convicted of attempted murder and attempted robbery. During deliberations, the jury sent a note to the trial court which indicated that two jurors were unable to hear the tape of the alibi witness's testimony and requested that the tape be replayed. Without consulting the parties, the trial court said no. Neither party was aware of the communication. When defendant's counsel discovered the communication, she filed a belated motion to correct error, which the trial court denied. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the action. There was no indication that defendant knew or could have known of the communication until his appellate counsel received the transcript. Thus, a crucial issue was, in effect, concealed from defendant and thereby not raised in his original motion. Under the facts, the trial court erred in not permitting defendant to raise the issue by way of belated motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pro se appellant, a former high school special education teacher, sought review of a judgment of the Laporte Superior Court (Indiana), which affirmed the revocation of his Indiana teacher's license by appellee, the State Board of Education. On appeal, he contended that the initial hearing notice failed to comply with Ind. Code. &sect; 4-21.5-3-20(c) (1988) and that the revocation was not supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher was convicted of raping a student. His conviction was reversed on the ground that the trial court had erred in allowing a State's expert witness to testify that the victim was credible. He was acquitted of a rape charge against another student. At the hearing on the revocation of the teacher's license, the State introduced a transcript of the victim's trial testimony describing the rape. The Board revoked his license, and the trial court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The transcript was sufficient evidence of the teacher's immorality and misconduct in office to revoke his license under Ind. Code. &sect; 4-21.5-3. Ind. Code. &sect; 20-6.1-3-7(a) (1), (2), Also, the complaint and notice of hearing complied with Ind. Code. &sect; 4-21.5-3-20(c)(2) (1988) where it was signed by the attorney who appeared before the Board. Further, the State was not required, under &sect; 4-21.5-3-20(c)(2)(6) (1988), to include the name, title, address and phone number of an administrative law judge when the Board acted as such. It was entitled to do so by Ind. Code. &sect; 4-21.5-3-9(a)(1) (1988) as the ultimate authority for teacher licensing under Ind. Code. &sect;&sect; 20-6.1-3-1, 7 and 4-21.5-1-15 (1988).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Dubois Circuit Court (Indiana), which denied his petition for post-conviction relief following his convictions for forgery and his sentence as an habitual offender. Defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to find that he was an habitual offender and that the sentencing scheme subjected him to double jeopardy in violation of the Fifth Amendment and Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 14.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant received two checks for his repair services. Each check was for $ 50, but defendant added an extra zero to the sums so they appeared to be for $ 500 apiece. Defendant was found guilty of two counts of forgery and was found to be an habitual offender. Defendant was sentenced to a five year sentence for each conviction, and each conviction was enhanced by 30 years under Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-8. The trial court accepted a plea agreement and set aside a conviction but did not alter the sentence. Defendant's appeals were denied, and his petition for post-conviction relief was denied. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed but sua sponte reversed the sentence. The evidence was sufficient to find defendant an habitual offender. However, the forgeries stemmed from a single transaction and were intimately related, so the trial court erred in fixing both forgery sentences with additional habitual offender sentences. The sentences were unconstitutional violations of defendant's double jeopardy rights and were prohibited by &sect; 35-50-2-8. It was proper to give defendant concurrent presumptive sentences but only one of those sentences could be enhanced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of post-conviction relief, it remanded the cause for resentencing with instructions to enhance one forgery sentence by 30 years for a total sentence of 35 years, and it instructed the trial court to specify which sentence it enhanced, to vacate the additional habitual offender sentence on the remaining underlying felony conviction, and to give defendant credit for time served.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the jury should have been instructed on the necessity of establishing territorial jurisdiction, and that the trial court had failed to do so. The court reasoned in part that defendant had preserved the issue for review when he tendered his proposed instruction on territorial jurisdiction, although the tendered instruction did not correctly state the law. The court further reasoned that the prosecution must prove territorial jurisdiction, and the issue must be submitted to the jury unless the trial court had determined no reasonable jury could have failed to find territorial jurisdiction beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that there was conflicting evidence on the issue because defendant had told different stories about where and who had committed the homicide. The court also found that the conflicting evidence as to where the homicide occurred was not sufficient to grant a motion to dismiss for lack of territorial jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a judgment that enjoined the City from enforcing the ordinance against the proprietor and declared that he had a valid nonconforming use. After its post-trial motion, which alleged bias and prejudice, was denied, the City appealed from the trial court's judgment. On appeal, that judgment was affirmed. The City maintained that it did not learn that the trial court's law clerk and the proprietor's attorney had filed suit against it in an unrelated action until after the judgment was rendered. In that regard, Ind. R. Trial P. 59(H)(1) provided that a motion to correct an error that was based upon evidence outside the record had to be supported by affidavits and the City had filed no affidavits.

The change separated the child not only from her mother, but also her siblings. Thereafter, the father was awarded permanent custody.

There was no evidence of abandonment, and no showing of a substantial and continuing changed circumstances in the mother's home.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate filed a petition for post-conviction relief from his theft conviction, which the trial court granted on two of the five grounds raised. The court reversed the granting of relief. A jury instruction given at trial regarding inconsistent statements was not fundamental error. The same argument was made and rejected in another case, which was decisive on the issue even though one word was different between the instruction in the prior case and the instant case. Moreover, post-conviction review of the allegedly improper admission of disciplinary complaints was foreclosed by the doctrine of res judicata because the issue was decided on direct appeal. The court affirmed the denial of relief on the other grounds raised by the inmate. A jury instruction given informing the jury that it was the judge of the law and facts did not deny him basic constitutional rights and due process. The instruction clearly stated that the jury did not have the right to make, repeal, disregard, or ignore the law as it existed.

The trial court imposed enhanced consecutive sentences. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defendant's arrest was not illegal because the girlfriend's consent to the officers' entry was sufficient to overcome defendant's Fourth Amendment claim. Further, the statement was properly admitted because defendant had a sufficient understanding of his rights to silence and to the assistance of counsel. Thus, defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied. Moreover, although the irrelevant testimony regarding defendant's willingness to kill might be presumed prejudicial, the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt rebutted any such presumption.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victims filed a personal injury action in the Lake Superior Court, County Division. They sought damages in excess of $ 10,000. The company filed a motion to change venue from the county, and an alternative motion to limit the trial court's jurisdiction to $ 10,000, or in the alternative, to transfer the cause to the Lake Superior Court, Civil Division, so that it could obtain a change of venue from Lake County under Ind. R. Trial P. 76. The trial court denied the motions. The court affirmed. When the victims filed their complaint in 1989, no Lake County Court existed. The Lake Superior Court, County Division, handled all matters assigned to county courts in other counties, including matters assigned to the plenary docket. Thus, the trial court correctly overruled the motion for change of venue from Lake County because no substantive right to such change existed at the time. Lake Superior Court Act &sect; 16(4) was not a local or special law that violated Ind. Const. art. 4, &sect; 22. As the County Division's jurisdiction was not limited by dollar amount, the County Division had subject matter jurisdiction of cases filed on its plenary docket that sought damages in excess of $ 10,000.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the midst of litigation between the property owners and the developers concerning the operation of group homes for the developmentally disabled in residential subdivisions, the Indiana legislature amended Ind. Code &sect; 16-13-21-14 to permit the group homes. As a result, the trial court granted summary judgment to the developers and the property owners appealed. The court reversed, observing that the state had the inherent police power to enact laws to promote the order, safety, health, morals, and general welfare of society. The court also observed that property rights were not absolute and could be restricted by governmental action that constituted a proper exercise of the state's police power. In this case, however, the court determined that the statute, which invalidated restrictive covenants in the property owners' deeds, did not benefit the general public but, instead, benefited the developers as private parties. Accordingly, the court found that the statute was not a valid exercise of police power, both as to the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 21.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county sold the property to the buyer at a tax sale. Notice of the tax sale was published in a newspaper of general circulation and posted on the courthouse wall. The mortgagee did not receive actual notice of the tax sale. The buyer argued that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not require the county auditor to mail to the mortgagee notice of an impending tax sale when the mortgagee did not make the proper requests on the forms available in the auditor's office pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-24-4.2 (amended 1986; repealed 1989). The mortgagee responded that the failure to make a reasonable attempt to notify it of the tax sale amounted to an unconstitutional deprivation of property without due process of law. The court held that because the mortgagee's address was readily identifiable, actual notice by mail or personal service was required. Lack of that notice violated the mortgagee's due process rights as a mortgagee. Accordingly, the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the mortgagee was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The zoning ordinance contained no special exception for group homes, but the trial court required the home to qualify for a general special exception under language requiring such exceptions for dormitories, fraternities, and orphanages. The court reversed, because defendants claimed that the home was created under Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 16-13-21-1 to -18, and as such, was a permitted use in a single-family residential area. The court held that the home was not required to administratively appeal the plan commission's order that it apply for a special exception, because its use of the property was a permitted use. The court held that Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 16-13-21-1 to -18 did not prohibit a local planning authority from requiring a group home to obtain a special exception, within limits imposed by statute. However, the court noted that zoning laws which limited the use of real property were to be strictly construed. Because the home's use of the property was a permitted residential use and met the zoning ordinance's definition of single-family dwelling, and because the ordinance did not require a special exception for group homes, the plan commission had improperly imposed the requirement.</SPAN></P>

The trial court conducted a hearing to determine whether a videotaped statement given by the child contained sufficient indicia of reliability to be introduced as evidence and also to consider whether the child was available to testify.

The court reversed, holding that the trial court violated the minor's Sixth Amendment rights by failing to give his attorney an opportunity to cross-examine the child about the substance of her videotaped statement. The trial court's error was not harmless because the videotaped statement constituted the only direct evidence linking the minor to the molestation.

During his trial, the victim, who was more than 10 years old, was unable to testify until a chalkboard was placed between her and defendant. The board was removed during cross-examination. The court held that the placement of the board violated defendant's Confrontation Clause rights because he was entitled to face-to-face confrontation in the absence of overwhelming circumstances. The board was not justified by the victim's mere inability to testify because there was no evidence, such as psychiatric reports or the victim's trauma, or particularized findings to support the placement of the board. The error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the other evidence against defendant was purely circumstantial and the victim's testimony was the key to the prosecution. The admission of the polygraph test was proper because defendant was not entitled to an attorney when he signed the stipulation to allow the polygraph to be admitted because it was not a critical stage of the proceedings. Also, defendant waived his rights to counsel.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 31-1-11.7-1 et seq. Appellees, natural father and adoptive mother, contested the petition. The adoptive mother was the child's stepmother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandmother was initially granted visitation rights. The father and the adoptive mother successfully sought to have the grandmother's visitation rights terminated. In that proceeding, a trial court found that the grandmother had no rights under the Act. The legislature amended the Act to provide that a grandparent's visitation rights survived the adoption of the child by a stepparent. The grandmother filed a petition for visitation, which the trial court dismissed. On appeal, the court reversed and instructed the trial court to set the petition for a hearing on the merits. The court concluded that the Act's amendment could be applied to the grandmother. The court determined that the grandmother's petition did not seek a revival of her initial visitation rights, but rather a hearing on her rights under the Act. The court found that such a hearing would not deprive appellees of their prior judgment against the grandmother. The court noted that the Act interfered with a parent's liberty interests only to observe its duty under the parens patriae doctrine and only upon a finding that it would be in the best interest of the child.</SPAN></P>

She had refused to sign a waiver of her rights, but later gave a statement. She claimed her statement was not voluntary. The court found that the state had failed to prove that the police scrupulously honored the assertion of defendant's rights and that the statement was voluntarily given. Therefore, it was improperly admitted. Further, without that statement, the court found that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction and her conviction had to be reversed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The County Sheriff's Merit Board held a hearing on two charges filed against the police officer. The Merit Board found him guilty of one charge but issued no penalties. The sheriff dismissed the officer based upon the Merit Board's findings. The officer then filed a complaint against defendants, claiming that his termination was wrongful because it did not comply with Ind. Code &sect; 36-8-10-11 in that it was not preceded by a decision of the Merit Board that cause for termination existed. The trial court dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court found that in order to provide the constitutionally required judicial review of the cause and discipline determinations within &sect; 36-8-10-11, the Merit Board's &quot;decision&quot; had to include a determination that cause existed for the particular disciplinary action. Therefore, the court held that before an officer could be dismissed, demoted or suspended the Merit Board had to determine the factual basis of the charge and the discipline for which that conduct constituted cause.

After the heir's father died, the bank filed a motion for proceedings supplemental against the father's estate as garnishee. The trial court denied the bank's motion, finding that the heir had disclaimed his interest in the estate under Ind. Code &sect; 32-3-2-3, precluding the bank from executing upon the estate assets. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision, ruling that the heir's disclaimer related back to a time before the decedent's death and his interest devolved as if he had predeceased his father. The court found that the lien did not attach to the heir's interest when it passed to him by operation of law at his father's death because the disclaimer's effect was that no interest was created in the heir to which a lien could have attached. The court ruled that the heir was not barred from disclaiming his interest because Ind. Code &sect; 32-3-2-10 did not apply where the judgment lien arose before the heir had any interest in the estate. The court concluded that executing an affidavit for transfer of real estate did not constitute acceptance of the interest that barred him from disclaiming it.</SPAN></P>

Also, because the title passed as a matter of law under &sect; 20-4-5-8, no approval by the fiscal body was necessary and the township board was not required to be joined.

Code &sect; 34-4-16.5-3(11), and that state and federal regulations governing the handling of gas did not change the result, either because the gas lines inspected were located downstream of the consumer's meter or because the regulations on which she relied were otherwise inapplicable to the facts.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dentist last saw the patient on February 10, 1977.

On July 23 or 24, 1986 the patient consulted an orthodontist, who advised her that he would not be able to put braces on her teeth until she had work done to her gums above two teeth. The patient alleged that it was at this time that she learned that a post placed by the dentist had apparently created other dental problems. The patient's relationship with the dentist ended either on February 10, 1977 or March 7, 1977. The patient filed her complaint on August 13, 1987. In reversing the decision, the court found that the patient's complaint was untimely under the applicable two-year statute of limitations found in Ind. Code &sect; 16-9.5-3-1. The patient's assertion that she continued to rely upon the root canal work performed by the dentist was insufficient to create a genuine factual issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charge of disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor, stemmed from defendant's loud, belligerent, and vulgar conduct at a meeting regarding the cancellation of his school bus driving contract.

The court affirmed, holding that the city court had subject-matter jurisdiction over the charges, even though the crime occurred outside of the city limits. In so ruling, the court held that the statute defining the criminal jurisdiction of the city court, Ind. Code &sect; 33-10.1-2-2 (1982), was simply a reiteration of the former statute, which clearly gave the city court county-wide misdemeanor jurisdiction. Section 33-10.1-2-2 did not evince any legislative intent to reduce the city court's territorial jurisdiction. Further, even though the city court violated defendant's Sixth Amendment rights when it tried him before a jury that specifically and systematically excluded jurors from the area where the crime occurred, the error was cured by his trial de novo in the circuit court, which jury was drawn from the entire county.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed that the windshield of defendant's vehicle was badly cracked. The officer stopped the vehicle and asked defendant to exit the vehicle. The officer conducted a pat down search on defendant and felt a hard object in defendant's shirt pocket. The officer asked defendant what it was, and defendant reached for his pocket, turned, and ran. Defendant threw the object, and the officer recovered it and reported that it was amphetamines. Defendant was charged with possession of a controlled substance. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence. The trial court granted the motion. The state appealed. The court affirmed, finding that the officer's pat down search of defendant was illegal. Although the court held that the officer acted reasonably in stopping defendant to investigate whether the vehicle was being operating in an unsafe condition under Ind.

The court concluded that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss the amended indictment on the grounds that it was not resubmitted to the grand jury. The court found that no substantial prejudice to defendant occurred because any defense under the original indictment would be equally applicable to the indictment in its amended form. The court determined that Ind. Code &sect; 35-34-1-5(a) did not require the amended indictment to be resubmitted to the grand jury after the amendment for an immaterial defect.

He appealed from the order of the Washington Superior Court (Indiana), which denied his motion to compel certain deponents to disclose what transpired at the various meetings of administrators and medical staff held pursuant to the peer review process or any statements concerning the physician made during private, informal conversations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order. It held that the information was not relevant to the issues raised by the pleadings. The physician argued that the information would establish that the medical staff's decision to terminate him was based on nonprofessional grounds thereby defeating the defense of justification. However, the complaint sought damages for breach of contract and the hospital did not raise the issue of justification in its answer. Also, even if the information was relevant, it was privileged under the state's peer review statute, Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 34-4-12.6-1 to -5. This statute prohibited the disclosure of any content of communications to or the determination of a peer review committee. It was irrelevant that some of the discovery requests sought disclosure of statements made during private conversations. Those statements might have shaped the opinions of the participating physicians. Further, there was no requirement that the communications be offered in good faith or be related to professional qualifications in order to qualify for the peer review privilege. The privilege did not deprive the physician of his due process right to judicial review of state action.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that: (1) although the driver should have been served with a complaint and summons, the fact that the charges were brought by an information and criminal summons did not constitute reversible error, because the driver was aware of the charges against him and did not show that he was misled, in any manner, in the preparation of his defense; (2) the driver's failure to comply with Ind.

Trial P. 38(B) waived his right to a trial by jury; (3) the driver's religious beliefs did not constitute a legal defense to the charges; and (4) the collective benefit to the general public of traffic safety laws outweighed any infringement on the driver's free exercise of the right to travel and the right to freedom of religion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department discharged the fireman for engaging in conduct unbecoming an officer. He was intoxicated one evening when he appeared at the station while he was off duty. On the second occasion, he committed theft of gasoline from one of the emergency vehicles and of meat stored in the department's freezer. The court found that the department relied on off duty firefighters often and that the chief had warned the fireman that he did not want the fireman at the station when he was off duty and had been drinking. The Board was not required to find that the fireman had been drinking to the extent that he was unfit for duty. The court found it necessary to address the issue of theft because the evidence of the fireman's intoxication was sufficient to support the Board's decision to dismiss the fireman. Other issues raised by the fireman were not preserved for review and as such, he could not complain of error as to those issues. Finally, because the department relied on off-duty officers and because the fireman held a position of authority, the requirement that he not engage in conduct that might impair his ability to respond in an emergency was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

The trial court then granted the husband's motion for a temporary injunction to enjoin the wife from obtaining the abortion, concluding that the husband had a right in the wife's unborn fetus. The court reversed the judgment, by holding that abortions were deemed constitutional, therefore, the state could not delegate to a spouse a veto power over abortion that the state itself was absolutely and totally prohibited from exercising during the first trimester of pregnancy.</SPAN></P>

Defendant, who was employed at the adult bookstore as a cashier, picked up the magazines to determine the price, rang up the sale, and placed the magazines in a paper bag. Defendant was charged by information with two counts of offer, distribution, and exhibition of obscene material. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the Indiana Obscenity Statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 35-49-1-1 to 35-49-3-4, was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The court rejected defendant's argument that the Indiana Obscenity Statute was unconstitutional because the statutory definition of contemporary community standards was not expressly limited to the adult community. Further, the trial court did not err by making certain rulings on the final jury instructions. The trial court properly excluded defendant's evidence relating to the availability of comparable sexually explicit materials in the county.

Plaintiff was 13 years old at the time. Seven years later, plaintiff filed a complaint for damages against the school. The school set forth as an affirmative defense plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirements of the Indiana Tort Claims Act. The trial court granted summary judgment for the school. Prior to the summary judgment hearing, plaintiff had filed a second cause of action against the school, alleging the same facts, but also alleging that notice had been timely filed. The trial court granted summary judgment for the school in the second action. Plaintiff's appeals were consolidated. The court held that plaintiff was barred from maintaining her claim because she failed to file timely notice with the school. The school was not estopped from asserting non-compliance with the notice provisions, even though it had actual notice that the incident occurred. Plaintiff was barred by res judicata from relitigating the same claim in her second cause of action.</SPAN></P>

The owner filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, alleging an unconstitutional taking of his property by the Commissioners. A lower court directed the Commissioners to grant the rezoning. The landowners filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and injunction seeking to set aside the lower court's judgment. The trial court entered summary judgment against the landowners. On appeal, the court found that the lower court had jurisdiction to review the constitutionality of the Commissioners' decision. However, the court also found that the lower court exceeded its authority by ordering the Commissioners to rezone the owner's property.

The pathologist argued that the doctrines of continuing wrong and fraudulent concealment were not applicable because no physician-patient relationship existed or, if one did exist, it terminated when he diagnosed the tumor. The court reversed, holding that: (1) the trial court erred in denying the pathologist's motion because the physician-patient relationship terminated with the last act of health care the pathologist provided on the patient's behalf and the statute of limitations was not tolled under the doctrine of continuing wrong or fraudulent concealment and (2) the statute of limitations did not violate Ind.

As a result of the petitions, the New Jersey court declared the child to be a ward of the court. Subsequently, the trial court entered its decree of adoption. Neither the aunt and her husband nor the New Jersey court were aware that a petition for adoption had been pending in Indiana. When the aunt and her husband learned of the adoption, they filed a motion to vacate the adoption. The trial court specifically found that the adoption decree was invalid due to lack of consent from the aunt and her husband and the New Jersey court. On appeal, the court determined that in addition to the father's consent, the consent of the aunt and her husband and the New Jersey court were required.

The State contended that the victim was incapable of consent and that therefore defendant's sexual intercourse with her constituted rape under Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-4-1(a). On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defendant waived his claim that &sect; 35-42-4-1(a) was unconstitutional where he failed to file a motion to dismiss challenging the constitutionality of the statute. There was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction where the evidence indicated that the victim's understanding of sexual matters was that of a child of six or seven years old and defendant was aware of the victims' mental deficiency. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in striking defense counsel's remarks attacking the State's psychiatric expert where the remarks were not in reference to any fact in evidence and were improper. Defendant's claim that his sentence was excessive did not present a justiciable question where the trial court reduced defendant's sentence from 10 years to six years in prison, the minimum allowed under Ind.

The owners argued that the Commission's taking was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 14-6-29.5-2(a) (Supp. 1986), the Commission had the power of eminent domain and the power to lease improvements made upon land to private persons. The Commission developed a plan to acquire land to construct a marina. The legislature subsequently passed a bill prohibiting the Commission from taking by eminent domain land owned by steel companies. The Commission selected the owners' property as a site for the marina and commenced taking proceedings. On appeal, the court determined that the Commission had the authority to lease property to private purposes only for purposes in furtherance of &sect; 14-6-29.5-2(a). Thus, the court held, the Commission's limited authority did not convert the use for which the owners' property was taken from a public purpose to an unconstitutional private one. The court also ruled that the Commission's taking was not unconstitutional based on the fact that the steel companies' land was excluded from its taking power. The court concluded that the legislature could have reasonably determined that taking such land was economically impractical thus, there was a rational basis for the distinction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff car owner appealed an adverse decision in the small claims court action that she filed in the Grant County Court (Indiana) against defendant car dealer for damages to her car that was stored on the dealers lot. She claimed that the trial court erred in denying her demand for a jury trial because of Ind. Code &sect; 33-10.5-7-5(a) (1984 Supp.), and that the judgment was contrary to law, in part because it violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's car was towed to the dealer's lot where it was vandalized, and she filed a small claims action for damages. She also filed a demand for a jury trial, which was rejected, and judgment was entered for the dealer. On appeal she claimed that her right to a jury trial was denied in violation of art. I, &sect; 20. The court affirmed the judgment, ruling that Ind. Code &sect; 33-10.5-7-5(a) (1984 Supp.) did not extinguish her right to a jury trial. She could have filed her claim in a court where her jury trial right would have been preserved. The court rejected her argument that she should have received notice of her right to seek a jury trial elsewhere. Section &sect; 33-10.5-7-5 did not apply to her as plaintiff. The court also ruled that the automatic waiver of a jury trial that was effectuated by filing a small claims action was not unconstitutional because &sect; 33-10.5-7-5(a) altered the right to a jury trial only in small claims courts. With regard to the bailment claim, the court concluded that the dealer had stored the vehicle in a lighted, locked, and fenced area. Accordingly, the evidence supported the trial court's finding that the dealer had exercised the required degree of care.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which ruled for the dealer in the owner's action for damages to her car while it was stored on the dealer's lot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was adjudged an habitual traffic offender and he was ordered not to operate a motor vehicle in Indiana for 10 years. He then obtained a driver's license in California. Five years after his habitual traffic offender conviction, he was stopped by police in Indiana for disregarding a stop sign. The officer arrested him for operating a motor vehicle after having been adjudged an habitual traffic offender, under Ind. Code &sect; 9-4-13-14 (1982) (current version at Ind. Code &sect; 9-12-3-1). Defendant appealed from his subsequent conviction, and the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the provision was not unconstitutionally vague. The court then found that &sect; 9-4-13-14 was applicable to defendant after his right to drive was revoked under the habitual offender provision, Ind. Code &sect; 9-4-13-10 (1982) (current version at Ind. Code &sect; 9-12-2-1 (Supp. 1987)), even though defendant obtained a valid out-of-state driver's license. The court also ruled that Ind. Code &sect; 9-4-13-14 (1982) (current version at Ind. Code &sect; 9-12-3-1), did not impermissibly burden his fundamental right to travel by barring him from operating a motor vehicle in Indiana for life.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer's state police vehicle collided with a horse-drawn buggy when he attempted to pass a car. The Board only found the officer guilty of causing the negligent destruction of state property and the property of another. The circuit court correctly upheld the Board's decision. The court rejected as meritless the officer's contention that the Superintendent's disciplinary action was contrary to the Administrative Adjudication Act (AAA), Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 4-22-1-1 et seq. (1986). The court determined that the AAA did not apply because the Superintendent conducted an intradepartmental prehearing under the State Police Act, Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 10-1-1-6 (1981), not an administrative adjudication under Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 4-22-1-5 (1982). Pursuant to Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 4-22-1-11 (1982), the court ruled that only the Board, as the ultimate authority, was required to conduct a hearing and determination in compliance with the AAA. The court decided that the officer failed to preserve an issue for appellate review, that a delay between his appearance before the Superintendent and the Board's proceedings violated due process, because that issue was not raised in a motion to correct error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties' relationship produced a child who moved with the mother to Indiana after their separation. The mother's second husband prohibited the father from visiting the child. The superior court properly disposed of the father's suit. The court determined that a condition in Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 31-6-6.1-6(a)(6) applied and required that the father's action must have been filed within two years after the child was born unless the mother could not have been served with summons during that period. The court found from the evidence that the condition set out in &sect; 31-6-6.1-6(a)(6) did not arise within the child's first two-years of life and continue until two years before the father filed suit. The court decided that, although that condition would have applied in the child's first year, the condition ended as soon as he was moved to Indiana, when the father had to file suit in the next two years. The court concluded that the intermediate level of judicial review did not apply to the different period of limitation for the father under Ind.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant purchaser challenged a judgment from the Marion County Superior Court (Indiana) that was entered for appellees, a mortgagee and its mortgagor. The superior court denied the purchaser relief of quieting title in him. The superior court granted relief to the mortgagee in its action to set aside a tax deed that was issued to the purchaser, divested him of his interest in real estate from a tax sale, and quieted title in the mortgagor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgagor guaranteed a non-party corporation's mortgage for a loan from a non-party savings and loan association. The corporation conveyed title to the real estate to the mortgagor by quitclaim deed. The mortgagee's action named both the purchaser and the mortgagor as co-defendants and they each counterclaimed to quiet title. The court held that the mortgagee lacked standing to contend that Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-24-4.2 violated the association's right of due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV to receive notice of a tax sale of the real estate on which it had a mortgage. Although the court lacked jurisdiction of that issue, the mortgagee, in a post-tax sale position, could not demonstrate any direct pecuniary loss resulting from the operation of &sect; 6-1.1-24-4.2. The court decided that the mortgagee lacked any right to notice of the proposed issuance of the tax deed. The superior court improperly quieted title in the mortgagor because the tax sale involved no irregularities and, pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-25-4(d), the mortgagor's title was divested upon issuance of the tax deed. Therefore, the purchaser owned fee simple absolute title that was not encumbered by the mortgage.</SPAN></P>

The officer saw defendants sitting on a sofa, and directly in front of them was a coffee table containing, inter alia, drug paraphernalia. Although no one appeared to be under the influence of marijuana, police seized the items and made various arrests. A laboratory analysis revealed that the drug paraphernalia contained small quantities of hashish, marijuana, and TCH. A witness testified that no one had smoked marijuana while she was at the residence, and one of the defendants similarly testified. On appeal, defendants challenged the sufficiency of the evidence. The court reversed defendants' convictions, finding the evidence insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendants knew the residence was used for the unlawful use of a controlled substance and that the residence was used for that purpose on more than one occasion.</SPAN></P>

The chiropractor challenged the lower courts' judgments upholding both actions against him and the MLB challenged the vacating of the judgment against the assistant. The court held that: (1) the Shelby Superior Court properly struck the chiropractor's claims under various state and federal laws in his petition for judicial review because review pursuant to the Administrative Adjudication Act was an exclusive remedy; (2) the chiropractor's challenge of his license suspension was moot because the IBCE subsequently relicensed him; (3) The Marion Superior Court was without jurisdiction to hear the chiropractor's appeal because his complaint was not properly verified; and (4) the circuit court properly vacated its injunction against the assistant after Ind. Code &sect; 25-22.5-1-2 was amended to exempt the assistant from the prohibition of the unauthorized practice of medicine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant claimed that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. The court noted that proof of actual knowledge of an injury was not required in a prosecution under Ind.

As to the habitual offender charge under Ind. Code &sect; 9-12-3-1, the court held that the State had to prove that defendant knew or reasonably could have known that his driving privileges had been suspended as a result of his having been determined to be a habitual traffic offender. The court held that evidence was insufficient to permit the inference that when defendant drove on the morning of the accident at issue, while his driving privileges had been suspended under the habitual offender statute, he was aware of a high probability that he was engaging in the conduct prohibited by &sect; 9-12-3-1. Given defendant's acquiescence in the jury's composition, the court concluded that no error occurred as a result of the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for change of venue.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with the employee that the Board's decision was quasi-judicial in nature; the board provided notice to the parties, permitted the parties to be represented by counsel, convened a formal hearing, took evidence, judged the credibility of the witnesses and weighed the evidence, and then made a decision to affirmed the discharge decision. Thus, the employee did have a right to appeal. The court further found that because Ind. Code &sect; 36-2-2-27 did not specify the method of computing the 30-day statute of limitations, Ind. R. Trial P. 6(A), (E) applied and the statute was not therefore unconstitutionally value. Furthermore, the &quot;date the executive decision was made&quot; was the date on which the Board posted notice to the employee.

The trial court disagreed, and the court affirmed.

The court noted that petitioner did not allege that the omission affected his decision to enter a guilty plea. The court held that petitioner waived his objection to the trial court judge hearing the petition because he failed to raise the issue at trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In her motion to dismiss the mother asserted that the paternity action was not within the juvenile court's jurisdiction because the child had been adopted. On appeal, the court reversed the juvenile court's denial of the motion. The court held that paternity action should have been dismissed because the adoption was valid. The court considered the state's paternity action and adoption statutes, specifically Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 31-6-6.1-1, 31-6-6.1-2(a)(2), 31-3-1-8, and held that the state had sufficiently protected the alleged father's opportunity, as an unwed father, to establish a responsible parental relationship with his child. The court held that requiring an unwed father to take an extra step toward establishing a relationship with the child and toward accepting responsibility was not unreasonable. Due process did not require that every possible biological father be given notice of adoption proceedings, but only that the notice scheme not omit many responsible fathers. The court concluded that requiring unwed fathers to initiate a paternity action in order to ensure that they received notice of adoption proceedings was not an onerous burden.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fee payers brought an action to recover administrative fees retained by the county court when the fee payers posted cash bail bonds. The fee payers claimed they were denied the opportunity to post full cash bail, and that the charging of an administrative fee pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-33-8-3(2) (1986) was unconstitutional. The trial court entered judgment in favor of appellees. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held the orders in no way denied the accused the opportunity to post full cash bail. Somewhat ambiguously, the bail schedule merely suggested two viable alternatives to posting bail, but did not preclude any other statutorily recognized bail options. An administrative fee could be charged when an accused posted a cash bail bond. Further, there was no unlawful taking of property of the fee payers to which they were entitled to compensation. Rather, the fee payers voluntarily parted with 10 percent of the amount deposited in exchange for benefits received from not having to deal with a bail bondsman and thereby forfeiting, in all likelihood, the full 10 percent bail amount. Further, the percentage method to determine the fee had considerable precedent.</SPAN></P>

The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly after the employee was hired by the city, he was discharged. The employee sued the city, and they settled the dispute by entering into an agreement that released the city from any further tort liability and provided for the employee's reinstatement. Several months later, the employee was again terminated after he paid a facility rental fee to the city on behalf of his assistant after the assistant wrongfully withheld the payment. The employee sued the city claiming his discharge was in breach of an employment agreement and deprived him of a property interest in continued employment and of a liberty interest in his name and reputation. The trial court granted the city's motion to dismiss and to strike, and the employee appealed. The court reversed and remanded. The employee was not an at-will employee. The settlement agreement entered into between the employee and the city constituted an employment contract, even though no definite term of employment was specified, because the employee's release of tort liability was sufficient independent consideration to convert the agreement into a contract. Therefore, the employee could only be discharged with good cause shown.</SPAN></P>

The livery appealed, challenging not only the default judgment but also the constitutionality of the ordinance. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the sanction for discovery misconduct and that a lesser sanction was not adequate. The court held that the livery failed to overcome the strong presumption in favor of the constitutionality of the ordinance, finding that it did not violate due process because it was not so vague or overbroad that a person of ordinary intelligence would not be aware of the proscribed conduct.

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial court properly excluded the two city ordinances. The court found that the city speed ordinance was preempted by the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970, 45 U.S.C.S. &sect; 434, and by the Federal Railroad Administration regulations in 49 C.F.R. &sect; 213.9.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Law enforcement officers purchased several magazines containing graphic photographs of heterosexual and homosexual activity at two stores allegedly owned or operated by defendants. The State thereafter charged defendants with violating Indiana's obscenity statute,&nbsp;Ind.

Defendants moved to dismiss the RICO counts on the ground that RICO was unconstitutionally vague and violative of the 14th Amendment, and the trial court found that RICO could not be constitutionally applied to violations of Indiana's obscenity statute. The court held that the trial court erred in granting defendants' motion to dismiss regarding the counts based on the RICO statute because the Indiana Supreme Court had recently held, in a factually similar case, that: (1) the Indiana RICO statute included obscenity violations as a predicate offense; and (2) the RICO statute, as it pertained to the predicate offense of obscenity, did not violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

He claimed that &sect; 3-1-23-28 was applied in a discriminatory manner so as to deny him equal protection of the law and that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. He claimed that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that he acted recklessly and that the findings of contempt were improper. The court held that (1) the fact that defendant was motivated by a desire to protest the unavailability of write-in voting was irrelevant; (2) there was sufficient evidence to support the finding that defendant acted with the requisite intent; (3) enforcement of &sect; 3-1-23-28 did not violate defendant's equal protection rights and the statute was not vague; and (4) the contempt order with respect to the statements was insufficient because it did not contain specific findings, but the contempt order with respect to defendant's leaving the courtroom met the specificity requirement.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the grandmother's petition for visitation pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 31-1-11.7(d) of the Indiana Grandparent's Visitation Statute (Act), Ind. Code &sect; 31-1-11 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father was married to the grandmother's daughter, and one child was born to them. The child's natural mother died, and the father married the stepmother. Shortly after the grandmother was granted visitation rights, the stepmother adopted the child, and a petition for modification and termination of the visitation order was filed. The trial court denied the petition. However, in an initial appeal, the court reversed on the ground that the stepmother's adoption of the child cut off the grandmother's visitation rights under the Act. On appeal, the question for resolution was whether Ind. Code &sect; 31-1-11.7(d) of the Act, which provided that grandparent visitation rights survived the adoption of the child by a stepparent, preserved such rights for the grandparents of children who had been adopted before subsection (d) was added. The court held that: (1) under the original Act, visitation rights did not survive adoption by a stepparent; (2) the legislature's subsequent amendment did not change that interpretation; and (3) since prospective application was sufficient to carry out the purpose of the Act, the grandmother was not entitled to the benefit of retroactive application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees claimed they would suffer financially from the ban on gill fishing nets. As the parties seeking the preliminary injunction, appellees were required to show an irreparable injury to a legally recognized right. Because appellees had no legally recognized right to claim as harmed, the court held that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the injunction. The court noted that appellees could not assert any property interest in the fish harvested from the state's waters. Moreover, commercial fishermen's license to fish in the state's waters was a revocable privilege, not a right. The trial court further abused its discretion because appellees failed to establish even a prima facie case that the DNR acted improperly by enacting its emergency order and failed to prove that the order was arbitrary and capricious. The court held that the issue on appeal was not moot where potential liability existed under the bond posted by appellees. The public interest exception to mootness was also triggered because the issue was one of great importance that would likely recur and it would evade review if appellees obtained an injunction before the ban.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of corrupt business influence. On appeal, the appellate court had found that an unconstitutional seizure of evidence had occurred, evidence which was subsequently admitted. The appellate court ordered a new trial. A new trial was held without the unconstitutionally seized items in evidence. Again, in the Vanderburgh Superior Court (Indiana), defendant was convicted of corrupt business influence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant presented four issues for review: (1) whether the trial court properly followed the law of the case; (2) whether defendant's double jeopardy rights were violated; (3) whether the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the prosecution's second amended information; and (4) whether the jury verdict was contrary to law and not sustained by sufficient evidence in view of the charging information. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The law of the case was correctly applied by the trial court on remand. Defendant's first conviction was reversed to rectify trial error, namely the admission of improperly seized evidence. The appellate court did not rule upon the sufficiency of the evidence. Therefore, there was no double jeopardy violation. The second amended complaint was sufficient to inform defendant he was being charged with attempted receipt of stolen property. The prosecution proved the offense of attempted receipt of stolen property. Defendant could be convicted of attempted receipt of stolen property, which was a predicate crime for the racketeering offense. Attempting to receive stolen property was a substantial step towards the commission of theft.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted defendant police department's motion to dismiss the employee's amended complaint based on the fact that suit was not brought within the statute of limitations. On appeal, the employee contended that his reduced earnings were a continuing wrong and that the statute of limitations should have run from when each paycheck was received. The court disagreed and affirmed the dismissal. Although the state did follow the general rule that where an obligation was payable in installments the statute of limitations ran as to each installment as it became due, there was no continuing wrong in this case. The case involved a one time paid percentage increase to employees. Although the alleged wrong may have had a present impact on the employee's salary, it was not a continuing wrong. Accordingly, the statute of limitations began to run at the time the merit program was placed into effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed a charge of neglect of a dependent, Ind. Code &sect; 35-46-1-4(a)(1982), against a corporation which ran a care facility for the developmentally disabled, as well as against the corporate president and two of its employees. After a jury found the corporate defendant not guilty, the trial court granted the corporate defendant's motion for judgment on the evidence under Ind. R. Civ. P. 50, concluding that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of criminal recklessness. On the state's appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in granted the motion for judgment on the evidence. The court concluded that the state provided more than enough evidence to present a prima facie case of criminal recklessness, which was a lesser included offense of neglect of a dependent under Ind. Code &sect; 35-41-1-16(1), because the offense was &quot;factually included&quot; due to the manner in which the greater offense was committed. The court further held that the trial court properly found that Ind. Code &sect; 35-41-2-3, which provided that a corporate defendant could be held culpable for the actions of its employees when acting with the &quot;scope of authority&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 6-5.1-1-1, et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer filed suit alleging that the Indiana Intangible Tax Act of 1933 violated the constitutions of the United States and Indiana. In the complaint, the taxpayer sought refunds of the tax paid by himself as well as other similarly situated persons who were subjected to the tax. He also sought injunctive relief. The Department filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and lack of standing. Thereafter, the taxpayer submitted for the first time a claim for refund with the Department. The trial court dismissed the complaint without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On appeal, the taxpayer argued that the exhaustion requirement was inapplicable because pursuing the refund procedure was futile and the administrative remedy would have been ineffective. The court determined that the taxpayer was still required to go through the refund procedure because exhaustion was still required in constitutional challenges to tax statutes. Additionally, the court decided that requiring the filing of a claim for refund was appropriate because it afforded the Department the opportunity to resolve the matter on nonconstitutional grounds.</SPAN></P>

Because the witness was not present as required for an offer of proof, the court held that defendant's offer of proof as to the witness was inadmissible as hearsay. The court found that the prosecution of defendant was prejudicial and met the requirements for establishing the defense of selective prosecution, but that defendant waived the argument by failing to properly assert and establish her argument for selective prosecution. The court held that defendant failed to preserve as error the comments made by the prosecutor in closing arguments because defendant failed to request a mistrial, admonition to the jury or object to the remarks.

The former employee applied for and was denied unemployment benefits. The court determined the former employer's allegations regarding the record did not require a dismissal of the former employee's appeal. The former employer contended the former employee did not fit within the exception created for at will employees. The former employers argued that even if the former employee had a cause of action it had to fail because the law he was asked to violate was unconstitutional under the commerce clause. The court deemed this argument meritless. The former employer contended that litigation of the reason for his discharge was barred under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the Texas couple argued that guardianship proceedings were inappropriate to determine whether out-of-state parents or in-state strangers should have the care and custody of the minor child because Ind. Code &sect; 31-6-2-1 of the state's juvenile code preempted the guardianship statute when the potential effect of the proceedings was to terminate parental rights and authority over the child. The court found that the proceeding was in reality a Child in Need of Services proceeding for which the juvenile court had exclusive jurisdiction under Ind. Code &sect; 31-6-2-1(a)(2), particularly as the Indiana couple alleged that the Texas couple were not fit and proper parents to have care and custody of the minor child. Thus, the state's juvenile code preempted the state's guardianship code under the instant circumstances. The issue of a parent's performance as a parent, including both natural and adoptive parents, was only to be litigated under the juvenile law, which preempted the guardianship provisions and provided the exclusive means to determine parental fitness.

Code &sect; 35-42-4-3 and two counts of confinement in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-3-3. The court affirmed her conviction and found that a videotaped statement made by the victim was properly admitted under Ind. Code &sect; 35-37-4-6 (1984). Under &sect; 35-37-4-6, which the court noted was constitutional, statements made by young children who may have been abused could be admitted at trial even where they were not normally admissible if there were sufficient indications of reliability. No set formula existed to gauge reliability in this context, but the child's age, condition, and circumstances were all factors to be considered. Although at the time of the proceeding &sect; 35-37-4-6 did not specifically define videotapes as &quot;statements,&quot; the court noted that statements remained such no matter how they were recorded. This videotape constituted substantial evidence of defendant's guilt. Defendant claimed that the State failed to prove venue, but the court found that it had satisfied its burden by a preponderance of the evidence. Circumstantial evidence was correctly used to meet that burden.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee challenged the judgment of the Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division (Review Board), which refused to reopen a claim she filed for unemployment benefits when she was pregnant on the grounds that she was not entitled to benefits because she applied for and/or accepted a leave of absence from her employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Employee applied for unemployment benefits during her pregnancy, and her application was denied by the Review Board on the grounds that she was not eligible because she did not apply for a leave of absence. Thereafter, a federal appellate court held that all pregnant women who were denied unemployment benefits were sexually discriminated against. Employee then filed another claim for benefits on the basis of the federal court judgment. The Review Board again denied the claim because she had applied for and/or accepted a leave of absence from her employer. Employee appealed the ruling by claiming that the Review Board was barred by collateral estoppel from review the facts in its earlier decision. The court held that the doctrines of collateral estoppel and res judicata applied to administrative hearings, including the hearings conducted by the Review Board. The court stated that the Review Board was barred from ignoring its early facts that employee had not applied for a leave of absence, and therefore its second decision denying benefits was reversed. The court remanded for the Review Board to conduct a new hearing.</SPAN></P>

The welfare department denied the request and the trial court affirmed apparently upon the authority of Ind. Code &sect; 31-6-11-18 that limited access to information gathered by a county welfare department during its investigations of child molestations. The court reversed the judgment because the trial court abused its discretion. In so ruling, the court determined that &sect; 31-6-11-18 was unconstitutional as applied to the facts of defendant's case. The court held that defendant had an interest in discovering the child's statements made to the welfare department because the statements were material evidence that might have contradicted the child's trial testimony and police statements, and could have influenced the trier of fact to render defendant not guilty. Further, the court determined that the state failed to show that it had a paramount interest in non-disclosure where the child's explicit testimony at trial greatly diminished the state's interest in confidentiality.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that, under the plain meaning of &sect; 7.1-3-21-11, the excise officer used the appropriate terminal points when measuring the distance between the applicant's store and the church. Further, measurements by local boards did not violate Ind. Const. art. IV, &sect; 23 because &sect; 7.1-3-21-11 was mandatory and applied to all applicants, even if its operation was not uniform in achieving the same result in all respects.

There was no provision in either statute for a dismissal of an information or indictment due to a lack of probable cause. Probable cause was constitutionally required if an arrest was to be made based on an information. The probable cause requirement did not pertain to the filing of the information. Ind.

He contended that one of his victim's was available to testify at trial and that her videotaped statement was not admissible under Ind. Code &sect; 35-37-4-6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court concluded that the victim was unavailable to testify at trial because her participation would have been a traumatic experience for her and that her videotaped statement was admissible in lieu of her testimony.

After the State presented evidence that corroborated the acts of which defendant was charged, including the testimony of two other victims, the jury viewed the videotape. Upon review, the court found that the trial court's determination that the victim was unavailable under &sect; 35-37-4-6 was not error. However, the court found that upon the record, meaningful review of whether the victim's videotaped statement provided sufficient indications of reliability was impossible. The record did not show what guarantees of trustworthiness formed the basis of the trial court's decision to admit the videotape. Thus, the case had to be returned to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The attachment defendants challenged a decision of the Lake Superior Court (Indiana), which dismissed a motion for such damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attachment plaintiffs first filed an underlying suit against the attachment defendants in federal court. The attachment plaintiffs then filed attachment proceedings in the circuit courts, which entered attachment orders. Those orders were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. On appeal, the attachment plaintiffs alleged error in the assessing of damages against the attachment bonds because the elements of wrongful attachment were not satisfied, and the attachment plaintiffs had a good faith defense to the proceedings upon the bonds. The court upheld the damage awards and reversed the Marshall Circuit Court's refusal to award damages to all of the attachment defendants covered by the bond. The court held that there was no good faith defense to the proceedings on the bonds. Further, even though the merits were not determined, the attachment defendants still had a right of recovery upon a finding of wrongful and oppressive attachment. Also, the Marshall Circuit Court's ruling that some of the attachment defendants were not entitled to damages because they had no property attached was erroneous; they were entitled to damages for challenging the attachment proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted on multiple charges based on evidence obtained from a search performed of his mobile home and storage shed pursuant to a search warrant. Defendant appealed challenging the legitimacy of such search. On appeal, the court reversed the convictions and remanded for a new trial. The court found that the omission of the state and county in the text of the affidavit for search created no discretion in the execution of the warrant and therefore was not fatal to the validity of the warrant. The deviation from the statutory form did not amount to substantial noncompliance with Ind. Code &sect; 35-33-5-3. The court found that the police officers performed an unlawful general search because their warrant specified 9 items and they seized approximately 245 items. Because the discovery of the additional items was anticipated during the search, the plain view doctrine was inapplicable to the case. The plain view doctrine could not have been used to extend a general exploratory search from one object to another until something incriminating emerged. The state also improperly failed to return seized property not shown to be stolen as required by Ind. Code &sect; 35-33-5-5.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer sought an award of attorney fees on appeal before the court issued its opinion. After the decision, the manufacturer filed a request for ruling on its motion. The claimant argued the manufacturer waived its claim by not seeking rehearing of the decision, claiming that the court implicitly denied the motion by not addressing it. The court granted the manufacturer's motion, finding that it was not ripe for consideration until the claimant's right to appellate review was exhausted. The court ruled that an attorney fee award was justified because the claimant's argument that her child's minority tolled the statute of limitations was contrary to Ind. Code &sect; 33-1-1.5-5, stating that it applied to all persons regardless of minority or legal disability. The court found her argument wholly without merit and substance, and that her argument that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to minors had been resolved by prior cases and was brought in bad faith. The court remanded the case to the trial court to take evidence and make a recommendation as to the amount of attorney's fees due to the manufacturer and file it with the court for its review and decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the manufacturer's motion to assess attorney fees, retained jurisdiction of the appeal, and appointed the trial court as commissioner to determine the reasonable value of the services rendered to the manufacturer by its attorneys in the appeal.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied relief on the basis of laches, finding that the defendants' guilty pleas put them on constructive notice of their right to seek post-conviction relief. The defendants appealed. Although the court held that the trial court improperly applied the doctrine of laches to bar the defendants' claims because laches could not be predicated on constructive knowledge, the court affirmed on other grounds. The court held that the failure to prove that a destroyed trial record was impossible to reconstruct barred one defendant from seeking a new trial based on alleged violations of his constitutional rights because there was no evidence from which the court could conclude that his rights had been violated. The court held that the other defendant could not seek post-conviction relief based on newly discovered evidence when he had failed to attack the reliability of breathalyzer equipment at trial, thus showing a lack of due diligence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The electric utility companies argued that the court's previous decision dismissing their appeal was erroneous and conflicted with ruling precedent that the court may assert jurisdiction to review Public Service Commission orders entered in rulemaking proceedings. The court disagreed, finding that the order the companies appealed from was not one contemplated under Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 8-1-3-1 or &sect; 8-1-3-7. Both provisions clearly indicated that to be reviewable, an order must be based upon findings of fact supported by sufficient probative evidence. The commission could only issue such an order after receipt of evidence or factual data and a decision resolving the factual controversy. The order the companies appealed from was one that stated the obvious -- that the commission, after due deliberation and hearing as provided for in Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 4-22-4, had determined that its draft of the proposed rules was ready for submissions to the attorney general and governor for approval. This was not a reviewable order and the companies sought to bypass the administrative procedure governing attempted enforcement or application of rules by seeking review of it.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the Commission's determination was not an administrative adjudication and that the proceedings before the Commission were not final, and were ministerial and not judicial. The court further found that under the statutory scheme involved in the litigation, plans were submitted to the Commission for review, revision, approval, and certification pursuant to Ind.

The court concluded that the procedure did not involve the Administrative Adjudication Act, Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 4-22-1-1 et seq.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A petition plan to change the method of selecting members of the board of trustees was presented to the school board. The school board disapproved the petition plan on the grounds that it violated the 14th Amendment and Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. The school board then initiated two additional plans. In accordance with Ind. Code &sect; 20-4-10.1-9, all three plans were submitted to the commission for review. The commission determined that all three plans met the statutory limitations of Ind.

After the trial court denied its motion for summary judgment, the schools appealed. On appeal, the schools argued that the commission's decision was erroneous because it was not supported by the required findings of fact. The court held that the schools' action seeking judicial review of the commission's decision did not involve the AAA because the decision did not constitute an administrative adjudication.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant electric utilities sought review of a refusal by the Public Service Commission of the State of Indiana to stay and suspend enforcement of its rules, and an order that amended the rules to clarify them in reference to federal law. Appellees, public service commission (commission), state agency, and customer, filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the basis that the there was no subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission claimed that that two documents designated as &quot;orders&quot; did not trigger judicial review pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 8-1-3-7 because the electric utilities' challenge was to the rule-making process itself which was not directly reviewable. The court granted the appellees' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Direct review under &sect; 8-1-3-7 was appropriate only upon the commission's decisions, rulings, or orders which were rendered to resolve factual issues in a given circumstance. In contrast the &quot;orders&quot; at issue were rendered under the commission's rulemaking function because they operated in general upon a class of utilities. Accordingly, the commission's &quot;orders&quot; which addressed the electric utilities' challenge to the commission's authority to promulgate rules, and the clarifying &quot;order&quot;, which operated prospectively upon the class were rulemaking actions and were not subject to direct review. The court also concurred in the commission's refusal to declare portions of its rules unconstitutional or preempted by federal law because it lacked authority to issue declaratory rulings, and there could no appeal from its refusal to do so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the appellees' motion to dismiss the electric utilities' appeal to the commission's refusal to stay and suspend enforcement of its rules, and as to an order that amended the rules to clarify a reference to federal law.

The board alleged that the tattoo artist was engaged in the unlawful practice of medicine in violation of Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 25-22.5-8-1 (amended 1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board claimed that the tattooing of individuals was the practice of medicine or osteopathic medicine under &sect; 25-22.5-8-1. The trial court granted the tattoo artist's request under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for an injunction to enjoin the board from enforcing Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 25-22.5-8-1 (amended 1985), claiming that such violated his rights under the First Amendment. The court disagreed with the trial court's interpretation of the subject statute and reversed the judgment. The court held that the statutory definition of the practice of medicine in Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 25-22.5-8-1 (amended 1985) encompassed the tattooing of individuals for any purpose. The phrase for the intended palliation, relief, cure or prevention of an ailment was intended to modify &quot;the penetration of the skin or body orifice,&quot; because the statute's definition would otherwise have been redundant and nonsensical. The court held that tattooing for artistic purposes was not protected by the First Amendment and that the application of &sect; 25-22.5-8-1 to tattooing was not unconstitutionally arbitrary or capricious. The court remanded the case with instructions to grant the board's petition for an injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time appellants were hired, the pension plan would have permitted them to collect benefits after 20 years of service. However, a new pension plan was adopted by legislation that provided that a member was eligible for retirement after completing 20 years of service or reaching age 55, whichever came later. This new plan was made effective retroactively to appellants who had been employed for less than 25 days. Appellants filed a class action seeking a declaratory judgment that the new pension plan could not be applied retroactively. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of PERF. On appeal, the court affirmed. Because appellants' participation in the pension plan was compulsory, they had no contractual rights in the plan that was operating at the time they were hired. Therefore, the retroactive effect of the new pension plan did not result in an unconstitutional impairment of contractual rights under either U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 or Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 24. Retroactive application of the new pension plan did not violate appellants' equal protection rights. The legislature had a rational basis for determining the effective date of the new pension plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the court's original opinion it held that Ind. Code &sect; 27-1-6-15 (1986) did not eliminate truth as a defense to libel and was applicable on its fact to insurers. The court held that inasmuch as the subject letter to the state life and health guaranty association merely stated that the insurance company was not in compliance with that statute the letter was not libelous. The insurance company claimed that the opinion erred by failing to recognize the existence of two separate guaranty associations and by refusing to hold that Ind. Code &sect; 27-4-1-4 (1986) created a new private right of action. On review, the court held that the insurance company had not convinced it that its decision should have been otherwise. The insurance company argued that because the individual's letter was directed at the &quot;wrong&quot; guaranty association that the court committed error. The court held because it concluded that the contents of the letter were true and not otherwise prohibited, it did not reach the question of whether the communication was privileged. Thus, the preceding discussion of the separate associations had no impact on its original conclusion.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support conviction and that his due process rights were violated in that he was convicted of battering his child despite the parental authority afforded by Ind. Code &sect; 35-41-3-1 or , in the alternative, because the misdemeanor battery statute and the statute recognizing parental authority to punish a child were unconstitutionally vague in failing to fairly advise him of the limits of authorized punishment. The court found that the duration and intensity of the beating, together with the numerous wounds evident in photographs of the victim contained in the record, sufficiently supported the trial court's determination that defendant's parental discipline was unreasonable and therefore beyond the bounds of his legal authority. No reasonable person of ordinary intelligence would have difficulty determining that the beating defendant inflicted on his daughter was excessive and not protected parental discipline.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the Indiana Tort Claims Act gave the property owner the opportunity for an ultimate judicial determination of liability. The court held that, since the facts of this case did not present a claim for relief under 42 U.S.C.S. Section 1983, the property owner was not entitled to an award of attorney's fees as a prevailing party on a federal claim under &sect; 1988. The court also held that the property owner's claim was not pendent to a substantial federal constitutional issue which would warrant an award of attorney's fees under &sect; 1988. The court held that since the property owner had not prevailed on a claim enumerated under &sect; 1988 and had not presented a substantial constitutional claim pendent to his successful tort claim, an award of attorney's fees based on &sect; 1988 was not authorized.

The judge asked petitioner if he signed the bottom of the form but asked no further questions concerning whether petitioner understood the constitutional rights he was waiving. Petitioner contended that the post-conviction court erred in concluding he knowingly and intelligently waived his constitutional rights. The court reversed and vacated the plea. The failure of the trial court to ask any questions concerning petitioner's understanding of the rights he was waiving, whether petitioner had read the form he signed, or whether petitioner was literate in reading the English language evidenced the fact that the trial judge could not have made an independent determination of petitioner's understanding of the rights he was waiving at the time of the guilty plea hearing. Although the trial judge did not have to personally advise petitioner of his constitutional rights, the judge was required to make an independent determination, based on the record, that petitioner's plea was entered voluntarily and knowingly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant employer appealed a judgment of the Vigo County Court, Small Claims Division (Indiana) in favor of plaintiff labor commissioner, in an action on behalf of a former employee for unpaid vacation pay. The employer contended the trial court erred in finding that the employee, whose employment terminated after a union negotiated employment contract expired, was entitled to accrued vacation pay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff labor commissioner filed suit against defendant employer, on behalf of a former employee, for unpaid vacation pay. The trial court awarded enhanced damages to the employee pursuant to Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 22-2-5-1 and 2, and attorney's fees. On review, the employer contended the trial court erred in finding that the employee, whose employment terminated after a union negotiated employment contract expired, was entitled to accrued vacation pay. The appeals court stated that under the common law, once a trial court finds that an agreement to give vacation pay was made, and the services are rendered by the employee as promised, the trial court must find, as a matter of law, that the right to receive compensation is &quot;vested.&quot; Thus, because there was nothing in the contract indicating that the parties intended their relationship to vary from the common law, the employee was entitled to compensation as a matter of law, even after the expiration of the negotiated union contract. The court noted that it would be coercive to condition the receipt of the benefits accruing under the old contract on the ratification of a new contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court affirmed the judgment in favor of the labor commissioner because the trial court's conclusion that the employer failed to pay the employee's accrued vacation pay, as required by statute, was well supported by the evidence. The failure to pay the employee in this manner activated the statutory penalty provision without any further showing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Huntington County, Ind., Ordinance No. 1-1965 prohibited the installation of sand filter disposal systems in Huntington County.

On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The trial court's finding of fact that multiple contagious diseases could filter through a sand filter sewage disposal system was not contrary to the weight of the evidence. The denial of a sewage permit for the lot was a proper exercise of police power and not clearly erroneous. Sand filter systems could contribute to the spread of disease in the county. The denial of a sewage permit was not arbitrary and capricious, or an abuse of discretion. There was no unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation contrary to law. The developer was not denied any vested right. The lot was not exempt from state residential sewage disposal regulations by virtue of Ind. Admin. Code tit. 410, &sect; 6-8-12(C).</SPAN></P>

The trial court properly admitted expert testimony as to the cause of the child's death because it was probative, even though the expert was not absolutely certain as to his conclusion. Defendants were not entitled to a Miranda warning when they spoke to police and a coroner at their home because they were not in custody, nor were they deprived of freedom of action in any way. It was not error for the state to rely on its case-in-chief to rebut defendants' mistake of fact defense, nor was it required to negate defendants' religious practice affirmative defense.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant licensing council and appellee abortion clinic both sought review of an order from the St. Joseph Circuit Court (Indiana), which awarded appellate attorneys' fees to the law firm representing the abortion clinic in the appeal of a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim. The claim involved the constitutionality of the application of a statute that infringed on the abortion clinic's practice of performing first-trimester abortions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The abortion clinic was successful in the underlying action and in the appeal, which determined that the attempted regulation of first-trimester abortions through the application of Ind. Code &sect; 16-10-1-7 constituted an impermissible degree of state interference during the first trimester. After the court affirmed the judgment, it remanded the action to the trial court for an award of appellate attorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. The court reversed and remanded the attorneys' fee award. The court concluded that the trial court erred in applying a 100 percent multiplier to the lodestar figure and in awarding to the abortion clinic the costs of printing briefs. Although the court found that the case could be considered undesirable, it concluded that the negative impact of the case was diminished by the fact that counsel was not a member of the local community. Additionally, because the majority of the billable hours in the lodestar were attributed to less-experienced associates, the court concluded that reputation and ability did not justify the application of a multiplier. Finally, the court found that the appellate issues were not particularly novel or complex.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers appealed the assessment to the Fulton Circuit Court (Indiana). Cross-motions for summary judgment were filed. The taxpayers sought review of the grant of summary judgment to the board as to the 1980 assessment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers' motion for summary judgment on the 1979 assessment was granted. The grant of summary judgment to the board was due to a 1980 regulatory change to Ind. Admin. Code tit. 50, r. 4-1-6-2, which transferred primary tax liability to the taxpayers. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The tanks were neither fixtures not appurtenances and thus were not real property under Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-1-15. The tanks did meet the definition of personal property under &sect; 6-1.1-1-11 as they were tangible property held, used, or consumed in connection with the production of income. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 50, r. 6-1.1-2-4 did not place primary tax liability on the possessor. Though personal property held under capital leases were assessed to possessors, tit. 50, r. 4.1-6-3, 93 percent of the leases were residential. Because the tanks were not used in a trade or business or held for the production of income, they were operating leases which, under tit. 50, r. 4.1-6-3(B), were assessed to the owners. The court reversed the grant of summary judgment as to the remaining seven percent of the leases and remanded for a determination of whether they were capital or operating leases.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 27-1-6-15, that even if the contents of the competitor's letter were true, dissemination of information about the insurance company's financial condition was malum prohibitum and contrary to public policy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The competitor wrote to the insurance guaranty association, alleging that the insurance company did not have the surplus required to be maintained by &sect; 27-1-6-15.

The court affirmed the judgment below, rejecting the company's claims that it was not subject to &sect; 27-1-6-15 or that the statute was unconstitutional. The legislative scheme regulating the insurance business was within the exercise of the state's police power. Ind. Code &sect; 27-4-1-1, Indiana's unfair competition act regulating the insurance business, did not support the company's position. That statute did not in any way affect the nature of common law relief afforded to a party who was libeled, whether the act constituted unfair competition or otherwise. The court also rejected the company's claim that truth as a defense was eliminated by &sect;&sect; 27-9-2-3, 27-1-3-11.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When she was 10 years old, the ward was injured while playing on a swingset manufactured by the manufacturer. Over four years later, the guardian brought the product liability suit. The manufacturer's motion to dismiss alleged that the product liability statute of limitations, specifically Ind. Code &sect; 33-1-1.5-5, prohibited the action because it was filed over two years after the injury had occurred. On appeal, the guardian contended that &sect; 33-1-1.5-5 did not apply to persons with a legal disability or minority status established by Ind. Code &sect; 34-1-2-5. The court held that Ind. Code &sect; 33-1-1.5-5 was not subject to judicial interpretation because it was clear and unambiguous as to the elimination of minority and legal disability in product liability actions. For the same reason, the trial court did not err by refusing to admit legislative history to determine the meaning of &sect; 33-1-1.5-5. Furthermore, the Product Liability Act, specifically Ind. Code &sect; 33-1-1.5-1, did not contravene Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 12. In this respect, the Indiana Legislature was not constitutionally mandated to suspend the obligation of statutes of limitation in the case of infancy or incapacity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff visited defendant's place of business on a Sunday, and asked whether he was open for business. Defendant responded affirmatively. Defendant also stated that he had not yet sold anything that day, but he would if the opportunity arose. Additionally, defendant discussed the purchase of a particular motor home with the sheriff. Consequently, defendant was charged with violating &sect; 24-4-6-1, which prohibited engaging in the business of selling motor vehicles on Sunday. After he was convicted as charged, defendant sought review. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 24-4-6-1 was sufficiently definite so as to inform a reasonable person of the prohibited conduct. Defendant's vagueness attack focused on the definition of &quot;motor vehicles.&quot; However, any self-propelled recreational vehicle was a motor vehicle pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 9-1-1-2(b). Defendant also challenged the constitutionality of Ind. Code &sect; 24-4-6-1. Yet, because the state supreme court had already determined that the predecessor statute to &sect; 24-4-6-1 was constitutional and rightfully enacted within the scope of the Indiana Legislature's authority, such analysis applied with equal force to &sect; 24-4-6-1.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it was not unconstitutional for a statute to impose the burden of proof upon defendant that he possessed a license to carry the gun because the issue was not an element of the crime.

The court held that even if the State had the burden on that issue, because defendant admitted in his testimony that he did not have a license to carry the gun, there was sufficient evidence that the State had carried the burden of proving that he had no license.

They argued that the State failed to disprove their statutory defense. When a defendant raised the defense that in the legitimate practice of his religious belief, he provided treatment by spiritual means through prayer, in lieu of medical care; the defendant had to shoulder the burden of proving the defense.

On appeal, defendant argued that the instruction shifted the burden of proof away from the state and effectively required defendant to prove his innocence. Because the jury was not instructed concerning the state's burden with respect to the elements of the crime of driving with a suspended license, the court held that &sect; 9-1-4-52.5 was unconstitutionally applied in defendant's case.

IV and Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11. The court found that the state bore the burden of proving the warrantless search fit within an exception to the premise that a search warrant was required for a valid search, and that the state did not meet this burden. Even with the other reasons the officer had for searching, such as anonymous tips, the court concluded that there was not probable cause to justify the searches.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in ruling that he carried the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he was unable to provide support and erred in refusing a tendered jury instruction. The court affirmed the judgment. The court stated that defendant was charged under Ind. Code &sect; 35-46-1-5, which had two elements: (1) knowingly or intentionally, and (2) failing to provide support. Ability to pay was not an element of this offense. Therefore, the court held that it was not constitutionally impermissible to require defendant to bear the burden of proving his defense of inability to pay. In addition, the court held that defendant's support obligations did not constitute a debt and, therefore, the constitutional proscription against imprisonment for debts was inapplicable to his case. The court found that defendant's tendered instruction was mere surplusage in light of the instruction given by the trial court. Thus, the trial court did not err in refusing to read it to the jury.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the guarantors as owner-operators were aware of the debtor's liabilities and their guaranty agreement also waived any notice requirement. The guarantors were prohibited from contending they were injured by impairment of security when they consented to release of the collateral in each instance. Although the trial court erroneously found that the guarantors' conveyances made the guarantors legally insolvent, the court rejected insolvency as an indispensable element of a fraudulent conveyance action. The court concluded that the trial court property exercised its equitable jurisdiction in setting aside the conveyances to the garnishees because there were clear indicia that the guarantors fraudulently conveyed the properties to avoid their debts to the bank.</SPAN></P>

Defendants' challenged their convictions of reckless homicide and unlawful practice of medicine on a number of grounds. One ground being that there was no proper testimony establishing either the hearsay declarants' credibility or a factual basis for the information provided which lead to the issuance of the warrant. Consequently, defendants opined that the trial court erred in overruling their motion to suppress. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. It found that the credibility of the declarants had been sufficiently established. They were cooperative citizens aiding an ongoing criminal investigation of conduct they had witnessed.

Thereafter the landowners sought a variance, which the board denied. The circuit court upheld the board's denial. The court affirmed the circuit court's decisions and rejected the landowners' contention that the proposed use was a continuation of a prior nonconforming use. Instead, the use was never nonconforming because, although vehicle maintenance garages were not allowed in an R-1 zoning district, school uses were permitted and the bus barn was permitted as an accessory school use. In addition, the denial of the variance was not an unconstitutional taking of property as the change from a limited public purpose use to a less limited commercial purpose would adversely affect the essential character of the residential neighborhood as the comings and goings of the public seeking vehicle repair year round differed significantly from the maintenance of school buses during part of the year.</SPAN></P>

After the appellate decision in favor of the company, the funds were transferred to the company, however, the judgment was not fully satisfied. The circuit court held that the company was not entitled to the interest retained by the County for four years.

The court upheld the trial court's judgment. First, the court held that the trial court properly applied the rational basis test rather than the strict scrutiny test to decide whether the statute constituted an impermissible classification based on age. The court agreed that the age classification for hiring police officers was rationally related to furthering a state interest in securing the most physically capable and active police force possible and in obtaining the administrative advantages of a younger police force. Second, the employee could not invoke the protection of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 621-634, because she was not yet 40 years old. The court held that the presumption of validity which arose once the classification was rationally related to a legitimate state interest continued to operate despite the fact that in practice the law resulted in some inequality for those over 36 and under 40 years of age.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants contended that the Indiana tax sale statutes were unconstitutional as applied to this case and that the auditor's failure to include the street address or other common description of the property in the tax sale notice invalidated the tax sale. The court disagreed. As to the unconstitutionality of the tax sale statutes, the claimants misplaced reliance on a case that involved a recorded mortgage. The claimants failed to record their contract of sale with respect to the property at issue. While it was true that Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-24-2.1 required that the county auditor include a statement, for informational purposes only, of the approximate location of each property, it went on to provide that a misstatement in the informational statement did not invalidate an otherwise valid sale. The result of a misstatement was not any different from that of an omission. As a misstatement of the approximate location did not invalidate an otherwise valid tax sale, the omission of an approximate location under &sect; 6-1.1-24-2.1 did not invalidate it either.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant adult bookstores appealed from the interlocutory orders of the Hamilton and Allen Circuit Courts (Indiana), which denied their motions to vacate injunctions providing for the padlocking of the bookstores and the seizing of the contents under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), Ind. Code &sect; 35-45-6-1 et seq., and the Civil Remedies for Racketeering Activity (CRRA) statute, Ind. Code &sect; 34-4-30.5-1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the statutes were unconstitutional as a prior restraint, both substantively and procedurally. The court concluded that the statutes were unconstitutional: 1) as imposing a prior restraint which impermissibly impinged upon the dissemination of protected materials; 2) as the statutory procedures failed to comply with the procedural safeguards required even for the suppression of obscene materials; and 3) as the statutory provisions as they related to obscenity had to fall under the less restrictive means test for the evaluation of allegedly content-neutral state regulation which had an incidental impact upon free expression. The court noted that the injunctions constituted an impermissible prior restraint of protected communication, where each item contained in the bookstores was not reviewed for obscenity. Further, an adversarial determination of the obscenity prior to the en masse seizure of such materials was required, which was not provided for in the statutes. Also, the court stated that the sanctions were unconstitutional as applied to obscenity, given the availability of less restrictive means in furtherance of the state's legitimate purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's denial of the adult bookstores' motion to vacate the injunctions imposed under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and under the Civil Remedies for Racketeering Activity statute and held that the statutes were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and held that the claimant's action was a suit in tort and consequently the Indiana Tort Claims Act (ITCA) applied. The claimant failed to provide notice to the Department and thus, her claim was barred.

On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment, concluding that the tax was invalid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, the parents established the proximity of the perpetrator's car on the date of their daughter's disappearance to the area where her body was found.

At trial, the perpetrator refused to answer questions from the parent's counsel on the basis of his Fifth Amendment rights. The jury returned a verdict against the perpetrator and he appealed. On review, the court held that the perpetrator was neither compelled to testify nor directly sanctioned for his refusal to answer questions. His assertion of his Fifth Amendment right in the jury's presence was not error because the constitutional guarantee did not apply in a civil trial to prohibit the jury from drawing an inference of liability. Because the total damage award was within the evidence adduced at trial, it was reasonable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An abandoned newborn baby was discovered by a passer-by. Defendants were convicted of neglect of a dependent and each appealed. The court affirmed the alleged mother's conviction but reversed the conviction of the alleged father. The court rejected defendants' arguments that the underlying statute was unconstitutionally vague. The court determined that no reasonable person of ordinary intelligence would have had difficulty determining that the alleged activity was proscribed by the statute and that the statute was sufficient to advise defendants that their treatment of the infant was proscribed. The court held that the &quot;and/or&quot; language in the indictment did not hamper their ability to understand the nature of the charge or to prepare a defense. The court ruled that the probability calculations of defendants' parentage were properly admitted into evidence. The court found that the evidence was insufficient to support the alleged father's conviction because Ind. Code &sect; 35-46-1-4 required the endangerment or abandonment to have been either knowing or intentional, and the uncontradicted evidence placed the alleged father at his workplace when the baby was born, abandoned, and found.</SPAN></P>

The landowners' sole allegation was that a &quot;taking&quot; had occurred because the value of its land had been reduced from that of commercial or accommodation business to light industrial or agricultural, i.e., that it had lost the highest and best use of its land.However, the court found no evidence that the property was now under greater zoning restrictions, or that it must be rezoned to be used. There was no evidence that the property could not be sold for its remaining zoned uses, or indeed for the zoned use of commercial or accommodation business.

The students and parents claimed that Ind. Code &sect; 20-9.1-7-1, as applied, violated the Equal Protection Clause, the Free Exercise of Religion Clause, as well as Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 2, 23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under &sect; 20-9.1-7-1, which was included in the Indiana Pupil Transportation Act, parochial school students were entitled to school bus transportation. The Corporation permitted parochial school students to board the school buses only when there was available seating. No additional buses or routes were added to accommodate the students. In the subsequent action for injunctive, declaratory, and compensatory relief, the superior court adopted the order of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana, which ruled in favor of the Corporation. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, ruling that the Corporation's interpretation of &sect; 20-9.1-7.1 was consistent with legislative intent and not unreasonable, for purposes of equal protection, because several legitimate grounds existed for the decision. Also, the construction of the section was rationally-related to the valid goal of conserving limited financial resources. The court further found that providing transportation to the students was a type of &quot;equal aide&quot; that was not constitutionally required. Therefore, the court rejected the claim that the Free Exercise of Religion Clause was violated.</SPAN></P>

Prior to trial, the elderly and infirm victim's deposition was taken. It was admitted at trial over defendant's right to confrontation objection. In addition, between the time when defendant was charged and when his trial commenced, Ind. Code &sect; 35-1-30-1, which had required a twelve-person jury in a Class D felony case, was amended to require a six-person jury. Defendant argued that the amendment, as applied to his case, was an unconstitutional ex-post facto law. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that (1) it was reasonable for the trial court to conclude that the victim was unavailable to testify at the trial due to her age, sickness, or infirmity, (2) no violation of the ex post facto constitutional guarantees occurred because none of defendant's substantial rights was affected by the application of the amendment, and (3) a defendant does not have a substantial right to a jury composed of any specific number, so long as the number was not less than six.</SPAN></P>

The employee also filed claims under the Workmen's Compensation Act, Ind. Code &sect; 22-3-1-1 et seq., and the Workmen's Occupational Disease Act, Ind. Code &sect; 22-3-7-1 et seq., which were pending when the negligence action was filed. The employer moved to dismiss the employee's petition under Ind. R. Trial P. 12(B)(1), based on the Indiana Industrial Board's exclusive jurisdiction. The trial court dismissed the petition. On appeal, the employee argued that her action fell within the intentional tort exception to worker's compensation exclusivity. The court upheld the dismissal because the petition failed to allege facts that showed an intentional tort. The fact that the employer knew of a risk might be recklessness but that fell short of intention. Finally, the exclusivity provision of the Workmen's Compensation Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The owners brought an action against the state, which alleged that this revision violated their constitutional rights. The trial court found in favor of the state. The owners appealed. The court affirmed and found that (1) the contract revisions were merely a proper exercise of its proprietary powers and did not violate any constitutional provisions; (2) the state had a rational and lawful purpose for inserting the new provision into the contract; (3) the new contract provision did not constitute state action such that constitutional limitations should be brought into play; and, (4) saving taxpayer's money was a legitimate goal to be furthered by the exercise of the state's police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, husband and wife, appealed from the judgment of the Hamilton Superior Court (Indiana), entered after their jury convictions on charges of theft, a class D felony, Ind. Code &sect; 35-43-4-2, perjury, a class D felony, Ind. Code &sect; 35-44-2-1, and conversion, a class A misdemeanor, Ind. Code &sect; 35-43-4-3. The convictions arose from food stamp offenses. Defendant husband also appealed from his 16-year sentence rendered by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife contended that she was denied a fair trial because the trial court refused to sever her trial from her husband's. The court found it clear that the trial court and jury determined the wife's culpability separately and distinctly from the charges against the husband; therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to sever their trials. Both defendants alleged prosecutorial misconduct in providing information that led to a prejudicial article in a local newspaper. The court found, however, that defendants did not demonstrate prejudice because of its use, as no jurors read the article. Defendants argued that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the perjury convictions. The court disagreed, noting that defendants' signatures on the applications were unequivocal acts affirming they had disclosed all other sources of income, which they had not. The court finally noted that the husband had other convictions, but also noted that he had a stable employment history and that he would be unable to provide for his children if a prolonged sentence was imposed on him. The court, therefore, revised the husband's sentence by reducing it to two years.</SPAN></P>
