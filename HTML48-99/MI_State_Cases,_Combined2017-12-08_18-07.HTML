From the evidence, it could be inferred that defendant believed his wife was possessed by a demon and that, when he stabbed her, he believed that she was already dead, and that he was attempting to cut the demon out to restore her to life. A psychiatrist who testified for the defense concluded that defendant was suffering from acute schizophrenia at the time of the incident and had been insane. Psychiatrists, called by the prosecution in rebuttal, expressed contrary opinions. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in finding defendant sane at the time of the homicide. Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 517.1(1963) required the trial court, in actions tried without a jury, to find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon. The court held that because Rule 517.1 applied to criminal cases, the court had a duty to review for clearly erroneous findings of fact, despite the presence of conflicting evidence. The court found that the trial court's findings of facts did not demonstrate how the trial court resolved credibility issues and conflicts in evidence or the law it applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On return of the case from the Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board ( Michigan) pursuant to remand, the court sought to determine whether the provisions of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.351(1) placed an absolute ceiling on differential benefit payments by defendant second injury fund (fund) to plaintiff employee. The second issue was the method of calculation to be used to compute the five percent reductions required by Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.357.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was totally and permanently disabled from a work-related injury. When the employee reached age 65, the age 65 reduction provisions in &sect; 418.357 called for a 5 percent reduction in benefits. A dispute arose as to whether the differential benefits were subject to the five-percent age reductions and, if so, which of several methods of calculation should have been employed. The employee also argued that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 351(1) only limited the employer's contribution to two-thirds of his average weekly wage at the time of the injury, and did not apply to the differential benefits required to be paid from the fund. The court agreed with the Attorney General that because the employee was injured after July 1, 1968, he was only entitled to receive differential benefits in accordance with the two-thirds limitation of &sect; 351(1). The two-thirds limitation was imposed to avoid the unfairness of giving all recipients the same yearly wage and because continuation of payments at the full rate would have imposed an excessive drain on the fund. Finally, the Board applied the wrong formula to determine how differential benefit payments by the fund should have been calculated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the Board's decision regarding differential benefit payments by the fund resulting from increases in the maximum benefits. The court reversed the Board's calculation of benefits for persons who attained the age of 65 and remanded for payment by the fund under the proper calculation method.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of a circuit court (Michigan) that vacated his conviction in a district court of attempted possession of gambling policy slips, in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.306. The conviction had been entered upon defendant's guilty plea. The circuit court remanded the case on the original charge and not the lesser charge to which defendant pled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to and was convicted of attempted possession of gambling policy slips. On appeal, the circuit court held the statute constitutional, but vacated the conviction and remanded on the original charge because the district court failed to explain to defendant the waiver of his rights. On further appeal, the court held that the statute was not impermissibly vague. Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.301 et seq. reasonably indicated that its primary aim was to prohibit various forms of gambling and the possession of materials that had an integral connection with gambling games or operations. Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.306, read in this light, was reasonably interpreted to prohibit possession of written memoranda used in gambling operations. Defendant lacked standing to allege overbreadth because he did not demonstrate that the statute affected any First Amendment rights. The court agreed that the plea was defective and that the conviction was properly vacated. However, defendant could not be charged with an offense higher than that to which he pled. The prosecutor, although not asked to comment on the plea, had had every opportunity to point out errors in the proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the circuit court's remand in that, on remand, defendant could not be charged with an offense higher than that to which he pled guilty. The court affirmed as modified the circuit court's judgment vacating defendant's conviction of attempted possession of gambling policy slips.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, city's insurer, appealed from the trial court's order granting summary judgment to plaintiff, a city employee, in his action to recover amounts subtracted by defendant, pursuant to Mich.

The court reversed the summary judgment order for plaintiff and remanded. Workers' compensation was not plaintiff's exclusive remedy. Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3114(3) clearly authorized plaintiff to receive no-fault personal protection insurance benefits from defendant. However, the trial court erred in holding the setoff provision unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff bond purchasers filed a class action to challenge the legality of the business practices of defendant bail bond agency owners (bondsmen) under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.167b(3) and the constitutionality of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 765.26. The bondsmen appealed from an order of the trial court that defined the class and preliminarily enjoined the bondsmen from overcharging or summarily rearresting a principal in connection with a bail bond.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that (1) the description of the class certified had to be amended to limit membership to those with claims accruing within three years preceding the filing of plaintiffs' complaint; (2) due process did not require notice to the absent class members and, there being no duty to notify, the named plaintiffs' ability and willingness to fund notification was not a proper test of their adequacy as representatives. Thus, representation afforded absent class members was adequate. (3) There was no arguable legal basis for justifying 11 percent premiums after 1975 because the term &quot;face value&quot; as applied to a bail bond in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.167b(3) was unambiguous and explicit, and it did not mean 10 percent of the bondman's risk. (4) Although in the main opinion, a sole appellate judge concluded that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 765.26 was unconstitutional, the majority found that in balancing the interests of the various parties, taking into account the minimal effect of surrender on a bailed defendant's right to bail, the bondsmen's right to surrender was not offensive to due process. Thus the bondsmen could unilaterally revoke the bail bond and rearrest the principal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the terms of Grandville, Mich., City Ordinance No. 133-B, &sect; 12, the restaurant could not serve beer and wine for consumption on the premises at all on Sunday. The restaurant filed a declaratory judgment action seeking to have &sect; 12 held unconstitutional and void. The restaurant argued that the city had authority to prohibit the sale of all alcoholic beverages on Sunday, but was not statutorily permitted to ban some sales and allow others under the Liquor Control Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;436.19e. The trial court found that Grandville, Mich., City Ordinance No. 133-B, &sect; 12 was valid and enforceable. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that Liquor Control Act conferred upon cities the power to prohibit Sunday sales of beer and wine for consumption on the premises while permitting beer and wine sales for off-premises consumption. The general power to prohibit the sale of liquor was sufficient to authorize any partial prohibition deemed advisable. Thus, Mich. Comp. Laws. &sect; 436.19e authorized the city to impose a less than absolute ban on the sale of alcohol.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient went to the hospital because of uterine bleeding and abdominal pain. She signed an agreement to arbitrate any dispute regarding her care. She then filed a lawsuit against defendants for the doctor's failure to properly diagnose and treat her ectopic pregnancy. Defendants filed motions for accelerated judgments under Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 116.1(2) (1963). The hospital further alleged that subject matter jurisdiction was lacking because the patient neither demanded arbitration nor timely revoked the agreement. The patient claimed that the agreement was vitiated and that the Act was unconstitutional. The court granted the motions. On appeal, the court held that the accelerated judgment were prematurely granted and that the validity of the agreement was contingent upon whether the patient's hospital entrance was governed by Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.5042(1). The court found that the patient's affidavit sufficiently created a disputed question of fact as to whether she was a person receiving emergency health care or treatment within the meaning of &sect; 600.5042(1) and whether the hospital offered her the option to arbitrate after the emergency care or treatment was completed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of unarmed robbery and pled guilty to a habitual offender charge. The court affirmed the unarmed robbery conviction. There was no error in the overruling of defendant's objection to the admission of various exhibits due to breaks in the chain of custody because case there was sufficient evidence of the exhibits' identity and connection to the crime to support their admission at trial. The court vacated defendant's guilty plea to the habitual offender charge because the plea proceedings did not comply with the requirements of the guilty plea rule, Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 785.7 (1963). The habitual offender proceeding is closer to a regular criminal trial than a probation revocation hearing, and a guilty plea to a habitual offender charge involves the waiver of substantial criminal trial rights not afforded a defendant at a probation revocation hearing. The court determined that the rule announced in People v Parker, 50 Mich. App. 537, 213 N.W.2d 576 (1973), that a defendant need not be informed of his Jaworski rights prior to pleading guilty to a supplemental information charging him with being a habitual offender, was no longer controlling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant was denied employment with the city as a lifeguard because her brother was already employed by the city. The city based its action upon Ordinance 180, which barred the employment of anyone within the second degree of consanguinity to any other city employee. The applicant filed her action alleging that the ordinance was arbitrary, unreasonable, overbroad, and lacking any reasonable relationship to its legitimate purpose. The city contended that the ordinance was a valid exercise of its power and did not violate any constitutional guarantees. The city also asserted that the ordinance was rationally related to the object sought and was not impermissibly discriminatory. The trial court declared the ordinance unconstitutional, and the city appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that had the ordinance sought to prohibit anyone in a supervisory position from hiring a close relative, it might have been said to have been reasonably related to its objective of preventing nepotism. However, the broad terms of the ordinance led the court to no other conclusion than that its sweep went far beyond the legitimate objectives sought. Thus, the ordinance was overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was charged with armed robbery in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.529 (Mich. Stat.

A jury convicted defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the attorney-client privilege was not violated by the order permitting the prosecution access to defendant's psychiatric report because the statute authorized the exchange of such reports. The court rejected the claim that the order conditioning defendant's submission of the report to the prosecution upon his decision to proceed with an insanity defense deprived him of equal protection. The court ruled that defendant was not ordered to do anything more than what all similarly situated defendants were obligated to do pursuant to the statute. With regard to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 768.36 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.1059), the court held that the statute was constitutional since it established an intermediate category to address a situation where a defendant's mental illness did not qualify as insane, but did warrant treatment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the motion, and the court affirmed that decision. The court declined to adopt the more stringent equal protection standard whereby the classification had to possess a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation. The court concluded that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.827(8) was to be examined by the &quot;rational basis&quot; standard. The court held that there was no showing that the statutory amendments were capricious, arbitrary, or without a rational basis. The court found that the encouragement of inspections designed to result in a safer working environment and, therefore, reduce industrial accidents was rationally related to the purposes of the act.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant township sought review of the order of a trial court of Michigan, which rendered judgment for plaintiff landowner in his action arising out of the township's denial of a variance for the development of his land. The township appealed the grant of the variance to the landowner and the award of money damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner's parcel could only be reached by an access easement. He wished to develop the land and requested a variance from the township to build an access road that was narrower than the minimum width required by a township ordinance. The township awarded the variance to the landowner, but later alleged that the grant was invalid because the zoning board had failed to keep a statutorily required record of the proceedings. The landowner had already begun to build the road and had expended funds. He filed for a second variance, which the township denied. The court affirmed the judgment reinstating the landowner's variance, holding that the township could not be heard to deny a variance based upon the nonfeasance of its own officers. The court reversed the award of money damages to the landowner, however, upon the grounds that the landowner did not plead or prove confiscation. His claim for money damages sounded in tort, for alleged depreciation in value. Because the complaint did not allege facts in avoidance of the township's immunity, its request for summary judgment on the issue should have been granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the part of the trial court's judgment that reinstated the landowner's variance. It reversed the part of the judgment that awarded money damages to the landowner.</SPAN></P>

While attempting to flee the police observed defendant throw a gun. Defendant argued that &sect; 36-3-1 was unconstitutional and therefore the stop was illegal and the gun should have been suppressed at his trial for carrying a concealed weapon. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. Defendant did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 36-3-1 as it applied to 18 year olds because he was 19. His challenge was limited to whether the ordinance impinged his freedom to move by a person looking over the age of 18. The court rejected that challenge because defendant had no reasonable fear of prosecution under the ordinance. The court reasoned that under U.S. Const. amend IV, while the police could have questioned him as a part of their investigatory stop, defendant had a right to refuse to answer. But, the police had a valid reason to conduct the investigatory stop of defendant and their understandable miscalculation of his age was not a reason to question the ordinance's validity. Then, upon observation of the gun probable cause existed to arrest defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A labor dispute arose when the parties' collective bargaining agreement expired and no new contract was signed before the new school year. There was a protracted court battle where the teachers agreed to temporarily return to work. They nevertheless began an illegal strike. The board sent notices for teachers to appear or face termination. Many teachers were discharged for failing to appear. Those teachers instituted an action under &sect; 6 of the Public Employees Relations Act (PERA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 423.206, Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.455(6), challenging the board's decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the court was whether the felony-firearm statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp.

The court rejected defendant's argument that the statute was unconstitutional for overbreadth because the statute clearly applied to him in relation to his conduct. The court noted that a literal reading of the statute resulted in double punishment because an underlying felony was always a necessarily included offense of the separate offense of felony firearm. However, in holding the statute constitutional, the court adopted the reasoning of several other decisions based on legislative intent. The court found that the legislature intended to augment the sentence where a firearm was carried in the commission of a felony. Thus, the statute was viewed by the court as a sentence-increasing statute that did not impose a double jeopardy impediment. The court held inoperable that portion of the statute that created a separate offense and sustained defendant's sentence on the underlying felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to an armed robbery charge in return for a promise to dismiss a felony-firearm charge under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.227b and other charges arising out of an unrelated incident. There was also a promise not to proceed against defendant as a habitual offender. A trial court (Michigan) sentenced defendant to a term of 10 to 20 years imprisonment, and defendant appealed as a matter of right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal from his armed robbery conviction that there was insufficient evidence to bind him over on a felony-firearm charge. The court found that the issue was not properly before the court because it was not raised before the circuit court judge. Defendant also argued that the felony-firearm statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.227b, was unconstitutional as a violation of double jeopardy. The court noted that there was a split of opinion within the court but found the reasoning that the legislature, not the judiciary, was the proper body to define crimes and fix punishments, was the better reasoning and upheld the validity of the statute. The court explained that in those situations where the legislature intended that a defendant be punished for different aspects of the same act, the double jeopardy clause was not used as a bar to such punishment. Here, the legislature clearly intended that a defendant who possessed a firearm during the course of a felony be punished for both the felony and the possession. Because defendant could have been convicted of both charges, his plea to one charge in return for dismissal of the other was not an illusory plea bargain.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured was injured in a car accident and received Medicare payments for medical and hospital services. The insured's policy contained a provision for subtraction of government benefits, as mandated by Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3109.

The trial court granted the insured's motion for summary judgment, but denied his request for attorney fees, finding no unreasonable refusal by the insurer to pay benefits.

The court concurred with a statement in a dissent in one opinion that as long as everyone had an opportunity to enjoy the statutory minimum benefit, there was no absolute deprivation.

Following a bench trial, the trial court found defendant guilty of two counts of second-degree murder. Defendant appealed as of right, raising several issues for consideration. First, he contended that the trial court erred in failing to order him to undergo a forensic examination prior to trial. The court declined to find reversible error in ordering the examination and evaluation after trial had begun. The court noted that on its face, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 768.20a; Mich. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that his convictions and consecutive sentences for armed robbery and felony firearm that arose from a single robbery violated constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy. The court held that state law prohibited separate convictions for two offenses arising out of one criminal transaction where one was a necessarily lesser included offense of the other. A literal reading of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.227b indicated that a felony was required to be shown in order to convict on felony firearm. Therefore, the underlying felony was always a necessarily lesser included offense of felony firearm. However, such a literal reading would have required the vacation of the conviction on the lesser charge and an affirmance of the higher charge. The court held that such an interpretation would have produced absurd results and thus, modified the statute in light of the legislative intent. The underlying legislative intent was to require a mandatory prison sentence in all felonies where a firearm was possessed. Thus, the court construed &sect; 750.227b to the effect that it delineated possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony as a separate and distinct offense.</SPAN></P>

The officer found and collected evidence. Defendant filed a motion to suppress any evidence gathered because of the officer's failure to procure a search warrant. The State contended that defendant lacked standing to complain of the search. The trial court determined that defendant's assertion had merit and that he had standing. On appeal, the court determined that defendant lacked standing if he was not on the premises at the time of the contested search and seizure, alleged no proprietary or possessory interest in the premises, and was not charged with an offense that included possession of the seized evidence at the time of the contested search and seizure. Defendant had no rights in the searched premises and thus, no reasonable expectation of privacy. Additionally, no evidence showed that defendant was on the grounds at the time of or after the fire. He also admitted that he did not own or occupy the grounds on which the blaze occurred, and possession of the instrument used to set the fire was not an essential element of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate filed suit against defendants, the Michigan Department of Corrections Department and an associated individual, for injuries sustained when he was sexually molested as the result of defendants' negligence. The Department raised a governmental immunity defense after its response by means of a motion for accelerated judgment. The trial court (Michigan) granted the motion, and the inmate appealed as of right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed that the Department's failure to raise the defense of governmental immunity in the first responsive pleading constituted a waiver. The court disagreed and held that the Department raised governmental immunity as a defense through a motion for accelerated judgment. The motion was a motion out of time, but Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 108.7(2) (1963) granted the trial court discretion to hear motions out of time. Furthermore, a defense raised by responsive pleading was also treated as if raised by a motion for accelerated judgment. Thus, the trial court did not err in hearing the motion for accelerated judgment or in its determination that governmental immunity had not been waived. The court also held that the fact that an injury occurred in a public building did not in and of itself bring that injury within the defective condition exception to governmental immunity, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 691.1406. Other inmates caused the inmate's injuries and not the physical building. Because the inmate's claim was predicated upon negligently maintaining a nuisance and not an intentional nuisance, the nuisance exception to governmental immunity also did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Florida court entered a divorce decree that mandated that the father make support payments to the mother. The mother moved to California; after the father failed to pay the support, he was charged with a felony charge of willful nonsupport. California then requested that the Governor of the State of Michigan extradite the father for the charge. The Governor issued a warrant. The father brought a writ of habeas corpus alleging that he did not willfully refuse to provide support. The trial court granted the motion after hearing evidence on his claim. The court reversed the trial court's ruling and remanded the case so that the trial court could determine only if the extradition documents substantially charged the father with a crime. The court held that the trial court committed an error by examining the substance of the charge against the father as that issue was for a California court to determine. A trial court could only examine whether the extradition documents substantially charged a person with a crime. If it did, then extradition pursuant to the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act was appropriate. The court held that &sect; 3a of the Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

In conjunction with the airport's operation, the Board imposed several conditions on the taxi drivers who operated at the airport.

The drivers brought a suit which sought to restrain the Board from requiring proof of the disability insurance, which they claimed was too expensive and unreasonable. The trial judge entered an order which enjoined the Board from requiring proof of worker's disability insurance. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that there was no employment relationship between the taxi drivers and the Board. The drivers were in fact self-employed, and received their compensation directly from the patrons they served. The court noted that a self-employed person could not claim worker's disability compensation benefits under Michigan law. The court therefore ruled that the requirement to insure against claims that the drivers could not have asserted was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

Having paid workers' compensation benefits to the employee, the fund sought to intervene in the action to recover its payments from any damages that the employee might receive. The trial court denied the motion to intervene and certified its action to be a final order subject to appeal as of right. The court held that the fund's right to intervene in the employee's action arose only as a &quot;party in interest&quot; under &sect; 418.827(1). For the fund's right of subrogation to arise under this statute, the injury for which compensation was payable had to be one &quot;creating a legal liability&quot; in another.

Laws &sect; 335.341(1)(c); Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18.1070(41)(1)(c). He filed a motion to quash each information, claiming the Controlled Substances Act, Mich. Comp.

Defendant then entered bargained pleas of guilty to possession of marijuana in exchange for dismissal of the delivery counts. On appeal, the issue was whether the Legislature's decision to classify marijuana as a controlled substance or the Legislature's decision to place marijuana in a certain schedule resulted in a deprivation of defendant's rights to equal protection of the law. Defendant contended that the applicable equal protection standard should not be the &quot;traditional&quot; equal protection review, but the &quot;substantial-relation-to-the-object&quot; test. The court applied the traditional test, and found that the state of present day medical and scientific knowledge did not allow it to find the Legislature's decision to regulate marijuana to have been essentially arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent conveyed a parcel of land to the grantee's predecessor, excepting and reserving to herself and her heirs the oil and mineral rights. Nearly 25 years later, the first recordation of the heirs' purported oil and gas interests was made. The trial court held that the legislative scheme behind the dormant minerals act, which required the owner of severed oil and gas rights to do some act to indicate ownership within a certain period or face a finding of abandonment in favor of the surface owner, was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The clear purpose of the act was the development of valuable oil and gas reserves and that purpose benefitted the public. The act's conclusive presumption of abandonment, reviewed under the arbitrary or capricious standard, was rational. The act did not unconstitutionally impair the obligations of contract because it represented a legislative judgment that encouraged oil and gas exploration for the public good in a valid exercise of police power. Finally, there was no equal protection violation because there was a rational basis between the legislative policy and the statutory scheme adopted to carry out that policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The housewife sustained disabling injuries in an automobile accident and claimed benefits under an insurance policy issued by the insurer to her husband. The housewife alleged a loss of earning capacity under the No-Fault Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3107(b), for work that she &quot;would have performed&quot; during the first three years after the accident. The insurer defended that the housewife &quot;would&quot; not have worked. The court held that where the language of a statute was clear and unambiguous, no interpretation could be made. The statute clearly used the word &quot;would.&quot; The court affirmed that the legislature intended to provide damages for actual work loss only and not for loss of earning capacity. The court also held that the trial court's interpretation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3107(b) did not deny the housewife her equal protection of the law under both the United States and Michigan Constitutions. Here, the state interest was to provide recovery to those persons who sustained an actual wage loss resulting from an automobile accident and to allow for reduced insurance rates. There was a rational relation between the legislative objective and Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3107(b).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a worker's compensation carrier, appealed a decision by a trial court (Michigan), which held that the carrier was not entitled to reimbursement from an injured employee's recovery of noneconomic losses from defendant tortfeasors.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the carrier was entitled to reimbursement. On appeal, the court noted that there was a split of opinion on the issue with some opinions in favor of reimbursement and other opinions against reimbursement. The court found that the better-reasoned opinion was that reimbursement was not authorized. The reasoning was that it made no sense to reimburse a carrier for monies paid out for economic loss out of a later recovery for a noneconomic loss. The two recoveries were compensation for distinct losses, and the two recoveries did not provide any double recovery for the injured employee. To adopt the carrier's argument would have been to deny complete recovery to a seriously-injured employee while permitting any other person who suffered serious injury to recover in full. The court did not believe that the Michigan Legislature intended such a result in enacting the worker's compensation and no-fault acts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of a trial court (Michigan), which convicted him upon his guilty plea of robbery armed, a violation of Mich.

On appeal, defendant contended that his felony-firearm conviction had to be set aside because it violated double jeopardy under U.S. Const. amend. V and Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 15 (1963).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to robbery armed and possession of a firearm during commission of a felony. On appeal, the court affirmed. Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.227b provided that one possessing a firearm when he committed or attempted a felony, except for carrying a concealed weapon or unlawful possession of a pistol by a licensee, was guilty of a felony. The court was not required to resort to double jeopardy tests because the legislative intent of &sect; 750.227b was apparent. The statute applied by its terms to all felonies except those explicitly excluded. &quot;Felony&quot; included robbery armed under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.529, and the legislature had attempted to make certainty of minimal punishment the standard where firearms were involved in the commission of felonies. The minimal punishment purpose applied with equal force to robbery armed crimes as to other crimes. The legislature could have amended the robbery armed statute to add as a proviso that there be a minimal punishment where the dangerous weapon was a firearm without offending the double jeopardy clause. Thus, there was no double jeopardy impediment to its attainment of the same goal by separate statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed the judgment of the trial court (Michigan), which accepted their guilty pleas to armed robbery, a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.529, and possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony, a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.227b, in exchange for a promise not to prosecute them as habitual criminals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were arrested and indicted. Pursuant to a plea agreement, the State agreed not to prosecute defendants as habitual criminals if they pled guilty. Defendants entered guilty pleas. The trial court accepted the pleas and sentenced defendants. Defendants appealed as of right. The plea taking was procedurally correct because the trial court had explained to each defendant his rights and received assurances from each defendant that he understood those rights and wished to plead guilty. However, because only one defendant possessed a firearm, it was error to convict his accomplice for Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.227b(2) violations because his participation as an aider and abettor in the armed robbery was not enough to subject him to the enhanced sentence. The felony-firearm statute was not passed in violation of Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 3 because the act was complete within itself. Double jeopardy was not violated by the felony-firearm conviction because the legislature had acted within its basic power to augment sentences for particular crimes. The legislative intent to create an additional, mandatory prison sentence for the use of the firearm was controlling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court, which convicted defendant on felony-firearm charges. The court affirmed the remainder of the trial court order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision by a trial court (Michigan), which convicted him of a charge of assault with intent to rob while armed, a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.89, and of possession of a firearm while in commission of or attempting to commit a felony, a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.227b. The trial judge rejected defendant's attempt to enter a guilty plea. The trial judge found the plea to be factually insufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to the mandatory two years under the felony-firearm conviction and to not less than five nor more than 10 years under the conviction for assault with intent to rob while armed. On appeal, the court first rejected defendant's claim that the felony-firearm statute was an unconstitutional violation of the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States Constitution and the Michigan Constitution. The reasons were set forth in People v. Johnson, 272 N.W.2d 605 (1978). The court next found that the prosecutor's remarks were improper but that defendant's failure to object during trial precluded reversal on appeal. Finally, the court agreed with the dissent that defendant's failure in the trial court to request an instruction regarding the lesser-included offense of assault with intent to rob while armed precluded reversal of the conviction and precluded a grant of a new trial. Defendant's other claims of error were also found to be without sufficient merit to reverse the convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of the offense of delivery of a controlled substance. He was sentenced to prison for a term of 10 to 20 years. Defendant appealed from the judgment convicting him. On appeal, he argued that the Controlled Substances Act (Act), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 335.301 et seq., had deprived him of due process by shifting the burden of proof as to an element of the charged offense. Section 41(1)(a) of the Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 335.341(1)(a), made it illegal, except as authorized by the Act, for any person to manufacture, deliver, or possess with intent to manufacture or deliver a controlled substance. Section 56(2) of the Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 335.356(2), provided that the accused had the burden of rebutting the presumption that he was not the duly authorized holder of an appropriate registration form. The court concluded that lack of authorization was not an element of the crime of delivery under the Act. Therefore, &sect; 335.356(2) did not impermissibly shift the burden of proof. In that regard, the court compared &sect; 335.356(2) to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 776.20, which required the accused to prove that an exemption allowed him to carry a concealed weapon in a vehicle.</SPAN></P>

The court, however, found that the Michigan Supreme Court intended that its decision in the guest passenger statute case was to have retrospective application. Therefore, the court affirmed the trial court's denial of declaratory relief to the insurer. Although the Michigan Supreme Court had not stated in its opinion whether the case was to be applied retroactively, the intent was clear by the Michigan Supreme Court's disposition of a later case. Therefore, the insurer was obligated to defend the insured in the negligence action by the insured's wife, within the limits set forth in the policy issued by the insurer to the insured.</SPAN></P>

The trial court affirmed the determination. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held that the supervisor's action was authorized by Mich. Comp.

The court ruled that the supervisor's decision was a reasonable method of achieving the goal of &sect; 319.13.

After one victim escaped, defendants fled in a blue car after taking two of the victim's purses. Defendants were arrested after police were notified that armed robbers were driving a blue car. A jury found defendants guilty of criminal sexual conduct and larceny from the person. On appeal, the court held that a mandatory bill of particulars was inapplicable because defendants were not charged using the short form informations. Further, because no prejudice to defendant's substantial rights was shown, the competing interests of the benefit to the courts, the public, and to the administration of justice came into play. Thus, severance was properly denied. Moreover, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for substitution of attorneys. Additionally, &sect; 750.520c met the requirements of the Due Process Clause and was not unconstitutionally vague.

She contended that the trial court had committed reversible error by failing to give a requested instruction on manslaughter and by failing to instruct sua sponte on the lesser-included offense of inciting, inducing, or exhorting second-degree murder. The court held that the trial court had committed reversible error in not instructing sua sponte on second-degree murder because second-degree murder was always a lesser-included offense of first-degree murder. The court rejected defendant's contention regarding the need for an instruction on manslaughter. The court concluded that manslaughter was not a necessarily included offense within the crime of murder, and the evidence adduced at trial supported the trial court's refusal to give the requested instruction. There had been no evidence of mitigating circumstances or of criminally negligent behavior. The court also rejected defendant's contentions that &sect; 750.157b was unconstitutional, as a form of cruel and unusual punishment, as vague, and as violative of constitutionally protected speech.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied judgment for the firm, holding that &sect; 600.5839(1) was unconstitutional because it barred the suit prior to the date of the injury. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that &sect; 600.5839(1) did not violate due process by unreasonably restricting the right to sue because the Legislature could abrogate a common-law right of action before it vested.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff father appealed from a judgment of the trial court (Michigan) awarding custody of the litigants' four-year-old adopted daughter to defendant mother subsequent to awarding him custody in the divorce decree. He argued that the prior custody order along with the duration of his custody created an established custodial environment, requiring clear and convincing evidence of the child's best interests before making a change.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Custody of the parties' child was awarded to the father in the parties' divorce decree, which required them to petition the court for review after six months. The father made a motion in limine to require the mother to show by clear and convincing evidence that a change in custody was in the child's best interests, arguing that an established custodial environment existed within the meaning of the Child Custody Act of 1970, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 722.27 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 25.312(7)), requiring such a showing. The trial court disagreed, construing its previous custody order as temporary to afford an opportunity to assess mother's progress toward recovery from mental disorder and substance abuse. The trial court found that the father was endeavoring to destroy the relationship between the child and the mother and to substitute his present wife as the mother. On de novo review of the record, the court remanded the case with instructions because substantial evidence supported a finding that a custodial environment was established with the father, the custody order was permanent instead of temporary, and the proper evidentiary standard was clear and convincing evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded to the trial court to weigh the decision as to which parent should have custody of their daughter according to the clear and convincing evidence standard, considering the trial court's previous custody order as permanent rather than temporary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was in an accident with an uninsured driver. The driver contended that the no-fault law was unconstitutional, and he sought an injunction barring its enforcement. The circuit court held that the Michigan Court of Claims had exclusive jurisdiction over claims against state officials in their official capacities. On appeal, the court agreed. Under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.6419(1) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.6419(1)) of the Michigan Court of Claims Act, the court of claims had the jurisdiction to hear the driver's suit. Moreover, under evolving law related to equity jurisdiction and class actions, the court of claims could have heard a class action suit.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's trial the key prosecution witness, defendant's coconspirator, testified as to how she assisted defendant in passing forged checks.

On appeal, defendant contended that he could not be convicted of a conspiracy charge where his sole coconspirator had received immunity from prosecution. The court stated that when coconspirators were granted immunity no determination as to their guilt had been made. The court stated that a grant of immunity was not inconsistent with guilt and that defendant could have been convicted despite his sole coconspirator's immunity from conviction. The court stated that the coconspirator's testimony of other instances where she and defendant had passed bad checks fell within the similar acts statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 768.27, showed a similar method of operation over a period of time, and strongly supported the conspiracy charge. The court stated that the record revealed that the coconspirator herself forged the endorsement on the check before it was cashed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff nonunion city employees challenged an order of the Wayne County Circuit Court (Michigan), which held that they had to pay agency shop service fees in their action against defendants, a city, a civil service commission, a national union, and a local union and its officers. They sought to restrain the unions from compelling them to pay the fee. The circuit court dismissed the suit against the city, civil service commission, and officers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 423.210 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.455(10)), the city notified its employees that they had to join the union, pay the fee, or face dismissal. The circuit court held that the employees' action was not a class action as to employees who did not testify and prove their objections and that all the employees must pay either union dues or fees or be dismissed. Pending appeal, the United States Supreme Court held in an unrelated case that while a union could collect fees for collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance procedures, public employees could bar the union's use of the fee for political purposes. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the non-union defendants, however, it reversed the denial of relief to the employees who did not testify. While the case was not a class action, objecting employees did not have to indicate specific objectionable causes or prove their objections. The union had to establish the costs of legitimate expenditures, and the court recommended that the union calculate and refund the part of fees that was unrelated to collective bargaining and place the fees in escrow until it met its burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

On June 16, the Commissioners' accepted a revised estimate from the department, even though it was higher than the board's final assessed value. The City filed an application with the tribunal alleging that the equalized value was too high, and the townships intervened. The tribunal held that the Commissioners arbitrarily rejected the board's final assessed value. The tribunal adopted and applied the board's assessment. The townships appealed. Affirming, the court held that although delayed by the volume of reviews, the board properly exercised its statutory function. Further, the Commissioners, who deliberated equalization estimates before the board completed its final assessment, failed to fairly examine the City's assessment roll as required by Mich. Comp.

Plaintiff child filed a personal injury action against the city and the school district. He appealed adverse rulings.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court, in dismissing the proceeding under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 335.355 for the forfeiture of a vehicle seized incident to a narcotics arrest, held that the statutory forfeiture provision unconstitutionally failed to provide the vehicle owner with procedural due process. On appeal, the People contended that the forfeiture provision required the prompt institution of judicial proceedings upon seizure of the property and prior to forfeiture. Both parties agreed that absent adequate notice and hearing provisions with respect to the vehicle owner, the statute would have been invalid. The court reversed the trial court's ruling and held that the statute at issue was constitutionally valid. Due process and equal protection required a hearing, nothing in the statute precluded a hearing, and such hearing was necessarily implicit in the statute. Notice was served on the vehicle owner who filed an answer and a motion to dismiss, and a hearing was held. Those actions complied with the statute and provided the vehicle owner with adequate notice and opportunity for a hearing.</SPAN></P>

The witness was with defendant when he committed the crime. This trial testimony was very different from that given at the preliminary examination. It was not disputed that the testimony from the preliminary examination was hearsay. The issue was whether or not it fit into some exception to the hearsay rule. The court reversed defendant's conviction because under Mich. R. Evid. 804(b)(3) the witness's testimony against penal interest could only be admitted if the witness was unavailable for trial. Accordingly, because the witness was available at trial, his testimony was inadmissible hearsay and defendant's conviction had to be reversed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the operator contended that the licensing act limitation on the permissible number of 65-year old adults to be cared for in a foster care facility was a denial of equal protection of the law in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The court held that: (1) if any state of facts could reasonably be conceived as a just basis for the legislative classification, the statute would be sustained; (2) because of the varying capabilities of the different types of adult care facilities to respond to the needs of elderly adults for personal assistance, a reasonable basis existed for the legislature to limit the number of elderly residents in those facilities less capable of satisfying their particularly greater requirements; and (3) the basis of the legislative determination was rationally connected to the legitimate objective of assuring the safety and well-being of people utilizing the services of adult care facilities.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of two offenses arising out of the possession of the tape deck and the employees' actions, which were reversed on review to the appellate court. Both parties sought further review, and the court affirmed the reversal of the convictions. The court noted that the appellate court had concluded that defendant could be held criminally liable for the acts of his employees, and ruled that the one-year suspension of defendant's license constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that the conviction required reversal because there was no vicarious liability in the Second Hand and Junk Dealers Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 445.401 et seq. (Mich. Stat.

Defendant appealed from his conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the separate sentences for each conviction for criminal sexual conduct did not amount to an impermissible multiple punishment for a single crime. The court found that not only did defendant rape the victim, but he also aided and abetted his co-defendant in his acts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. Therefore, the court held that the acts of co-defendant represented a separate criminal transaction from the penetration committed by defendant. The court also held that, absent a stronger showing of prejudice, defendant was not entitled to relief from any alleged prejudice that might have resulted from certain members of the jury being exposed to media coverage of the crime. The court also held that defendant's motion for a mistrial was properly denied when a juror had to be excused after becoming emotionally upset during the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, operators of a sand and gravel business located in plaintiff township, appealed from the judgment of a Michigan trial court, which held valid an ordinance which required defendants to obtain a permit before continuing their long-existing business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The township conceded that defendants had a vested right to the nonconforming use of the property, but contended that the ordinance at issue was regulatory and was not a zoning ordinance. The standards set forth by the ordinance were such that the operators could never obtain a permit. The court held that several standards were invalid, either because they were vague or because they were legislative rather than administrative in nature. The ordinance's citation to the public health, safety, and welfare was overly broad because it afforded no sufficient guide for the board of appeals in the exercise of its discretion. However, certain portions of the ordinance were saved by construing them in such a way as to limit the power and authority granted to the board of appeals by the ordinance. The court held that another section of the ordinance was invalid as an attempt to zone on an ad hoc interim basis. Finally, the court held that, as it construed them, the regulatory portions of the ordinance were valid with the exception of a requirement that the operators prove the amount of material ultimately to be removed, which required such expensive testing as to be confiscatory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence indicated that defendant left his jail cell with a turnkey to make a phone call. On returning to his cell, defendant hit an officer, grabbed his keys, and fled. However, another officer recaptured defendant before he escaped from the jail. Although defendant was charged with both assaulting a police officer and breaking jail or attempt to break or escape, the trial court quashed the attempt charge, apparently not believing that an attempt to break jail or escape was a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.197c. On appeal, defendant claimed that the attempt charged was quashed on the basis of insufficiency of the evidence, and to try him would violate his right against double jeopardy. The court held that: (1) an attempted jail break through the use of violence was necessarily included within the completed offense; (2) even if the language in the attempt charge was mere surplusage or duplicitous, quashing it was error; (3) jail break and escape were not synonymous, and the evidence was not insufficient merely because defendant never actually escaped; and (4) double jeopardy did not prevent the prosecutor from charging separate offenses in a single prosecution.</SPAN></P>

Defendants were convicted of being spectators at a fight or baiting between dogs. On appeal, they charged that the portion of the statute that imposed criminal sanction on persons who were spectators was impermissibly vague and unconstitutionally overbroad. They also claimed that there was insufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably find them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. On appeal, the court affirmed their convictions. The court found ample evidence upon which the jury rendered their decision. One defendant's shirt was heavily saturated with the blood of the dog he was holding and there was sufficient testimony that they intended to have dog fights at the arena. The court also found that the statute was constitutional because it did not punish the witnessing of a dogfight per se. It punished attendance as a spectator at an event legitimately prohibited by law. It was neither vague nor overbroad and defendants had fair notice of the conduct proscribed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners appealed the judgment of the trial court (Michigan), which found an oil company as owner of the leasehold of all oil and gas rights in certain property which was claimed by the property owners. The property owners had brought suit against defendants, grantors and grantees, to quiet title to their oil and gas interests under the dormant mineral act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 554.291 et seq.; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26.1163(1) et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lawsuit was testing the constitutionality of the dormant mineral act. The statute provided that any person holding any interest in oil or gas in any land, other than the surface owner, was deemed to have abandoned such interest unless during any 20 year period such person did one of five specified acts of ownership. A three year grace period was also provided for persons affected to record their notice to preserve their interests. The parties agreed that none of their successors had done any of the five specified actions for a period of 20 years. The court held that the statute's effect and application as to the grantors and grantees was prohibited by the state and federal constitutions as a law impairing the obligation of contract. The court held that the gas and oil interest holders had a property right given them by private publicly recorded contracts and that those rights were subject to being sold, mortgaged, leased, devised, or inherited just as the surface rights were and that such rights were paramount to the state's right of control.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was adjudged a person requiring treatment and involuntarily committed to a mental health facility for 60 days. At the end of the initial commitment the mental health authority petitioned the probate court for a 90-day recommitment order, alleging that the patient, although somewhat improved, required continued treatment. The petition was dismissed on grounds that the patient did not meet the criteria for involuntary commitment. The mental health authority appealed, the probate order was reversed, and the petition for recommitment was granted. The patient sought review, claiming that that the mental health authorities had to meet the same standards for a recommitment order as for an original order of commitment and that this standard was not met at the time of his recommitment. The court held that anyone seeking a 90-day recommitment order under the Mental Health Code following a 60-day initial commitment had to show that the patient to be involuntarily recommitted was a person requiring treatment under the Act. There was enough evidence for the probate court to have found that the patient met such standard at the recommitment hearing.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that plaintiff was not entitled to recover benefits it had paid for the employee's economic losses from an amount the employee might receive in a tort action for noneconomic damages and economic losses in excess of the employee's insurance coverage.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One plaintiff tripped on a curb constructed higher than the adjoining sidewalk and suffered permanent injury. Plaintiffs filed their negligence action against the architectural firm and defendants, a city and a construction company, more than 10 years after the sidewalk was completed and turned over to the city. Plaintiffs claimed that &sect; 600.5839 was unconstitutional because it was a statute of limitations, which could not abolish a cause of action before it accrued. Affirming the judgment, the court held that &sect; 600.5839 was constitutional as applied to plaintiffs' claim. The court found that Mich. Const. art. 3, &sect; 7 authorized the legislature to abolish a cause of action that had not accrued and that &sect; 600.5839 was a statute of abrogation, not a statute of limitations, in respect to claims that accrued after the designated six-year period because it specifically stated when the period within which an action had to be brought began to run by expressly prohibiting any suits more than six years after an improvement was accepted.

The court held that the verdict forms, guilty but mentally ill, and not guilty by reason of insanity, neither denied defendant due process of law by shifting the burden of proof regarding sanity to him, nor equal protection by unfairly discriminating against him on the basis of his insanity defense. The trial court's refusal to instruct the jury that soundness of mind was an essential element of murder, requiring proof by the prosecutor beyond a reasonable doubt did not operate to deny defendant his right to a fair trial as the trial court properly instructed the jury as to all the elements of the crimes and also, that the prosecutor had the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was sane. The supplemental instructions omitting references to the insanity defense was not an abuse of discretion by the trial judge as he was only required to instruct on the questions asked. The prosecutor's closing arguments were fair comments based on the evidence presented. The defendant has no right to prevent the judge from giving a proper &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; instruction and the instruction was just and fair.</SPAN></P>

The alleged father made no request for a jury trial. On appeal, he argued that a paternity action was criminal in nature and the jury waiver provisions applicable to criminal cases applied to paternity actions. The court found that only subsequent culpable action by a defendant in a paternity action could result in sanctions being applied for refusal to comply with a court order, and in that regard the order of filiation and support did not differ from a civil judgment. Therefore, the court held that the consequences of a paternity action did not sufficiently approximate the effects of a criminal conviction as to warrant imposing upon such actions the jury waiver requirements applicable to criminal trials. The court also held that a defendant in a paternity action could not challenge the verdict on the ground that he was denied effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

Laws Ann. &sect; 257.1301 et seq. (Mich. Stat.

On appeal, the court determined that the trial court erred in finding the Act unconstitutional. Unlike other situations where the commingling of investigative and adjudicative functions in a full-time law enforcement officer were found to violate due process, the Act did not require that the adjudicative functions be before a full-time law enforcement officer whose functions included not only administrative adjudication but also the instigation or prosecution in separate proceedings of the same statutory violations, but before a hearing officer. The court found that the Act was not unconstitutionally ambiguous, was not an unconstitutional delegation of power, and that the terms &quot;price&quot; and &quot;cost&quot; were interchangeable within the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant architects, contractors, and an engineer, appealed the denial by a trial court (Michigan) of their motions for summary judgment in the negligence action of plaintiff guests against them and defendant homeowners. The guests were injured when the homeowners' wooden deck gave way. The trial court held that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.5839(1) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.5839(1)) did not apply to bar the action against defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guests were injured when a deck on the homeowners' residence gave way. They first brought an action against the homeowners, and then added the claim against the architects, engineer, and contractors who had designed and built the deck. The latter in turn filed motions for summary judgment, alleging that the guests' action was barred under the statute of limitations in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.5839(1) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.5839(1)) because it was brought more than six years after the homeowners occupied the residence. The trial court denied the motions, holding that the statute of limitations was inapplicable because the guests had not dealt directly with defendants. The court affirmed as to the contractors but reversed as to the architects and engineers. Because the legislature had not mentioned contractors in the statute of limitations, only architects and engineers enjoyed the six-year cutoff in liability. The statute of limitations did not deprive the guests of property without due process of law because the abrogation of their right to sue was a valid exercise of legislative authority. Their claims were barred before they came into existence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's summary judgment in favor of the architects and engineers in that the guests' negligence action was time-barred as against them.

The father filed a motion for a paternity blood test and jury trial at county expense but failed to provide information regarding his inability to pay under Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 120.3 (1963). The trial court denied the father's motion. On appeal, the court determined that the father did not have a constitutional right to a jury trial under either U.S. Const. amend. VI or Mich.

The court found that, although the father had a statutory right to a blood test under Mich. Comp.

The court concluded that the trial court did not err in denying the father's motion for a blood test at county expense because the father failed to submit separate documentation showing his inability to pay for the blood test.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, challenged the decision of the Ingham County Circuit Court (Michigan) that granted summary judgment to appellee canoe rental shop in the Department's action to enjoin the shop from renting canoes on state lands without a permit in contravention of Mich. Admin. Code r. 299.331 (1972).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 299.3a (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13.4), the Department was empowered to promulgate regulations concerning the use of public lands in order to protect their natural state. Mich. Admin. Code r. 299.331 (1972) provided that no commercial activities could occur on public lands without a permit. When the Department sought to enjoin the canoe rental shop from operating on the public beach without a permit, the canoe rental shop alleged that the law was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the department. The trial court granted summary judgment to the canoe rental shop and the court reversed and remanded. The court held that although another panel of the court held that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect;&sect; 299.1-299.3 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 13.1-13.3) were unconstitutional,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 299.3a (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13.4) was not discussed. The court held that the trial court was not to decide whether the legislation provided a workable standard for delegation but whether there were safeguards on delegation.</SPAN></P>

The Michigan Attorney General and a motor company were permitted to intervene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility company applied to the commission for authority to include a fuel adjustment clause (FCAC) in residential rate schedules as permitted by Mich.

A dispute arose as to the commission's rejection of a deferred billing collection proposal and order to write off the deferred charges over 10 years. The trial court vacated the order and remanded the matter to the commission to follow a proposal of an administrative law judge allowing a surcharge to secure the sum. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the commission's order was not unlawful, unreasonable, or confiscatory under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 462.26 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22.45). The court found that the commission knew about the accounting procedure change when it was considering the rate change and that the commission was in no way guaranteeing a recoverable paper asset. The company specifically stated that its new accounting method was not to be used to create a rate base greater than could be determined had the change not been made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police went to a house looking for two suspects. One officer saw defendant throw a gun and green garbage bag from a second story window. The officer opened the garbage bag and saw what appeared to be narcotics. He confiscated the gun and garbage bag. Another officer located defendant in the house and saw him drop a bottle to the floor, which the officer recovered. Defendant was convicted of knowingly or intentionally possessing heroin. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the throwing of the gun and heroin out of the window constituted one transaction and therefore, the gun was admissible as part of the res gestae of defendant's crime. The court held that the testimony of an expert explaining the percentage of diluents present in street heroin provided the jury with a lay person's context for understanding the quantity of heroin defendant was charged with knowingly possessing and was probative and logically relevant. The court held that the prosecution's impeachment of defendant with a conviction under a law that had been declared unconstitutional was harmless error because it had a minimal impact on the jury in light of the substantial evidence presented against defendant.</SPAN></P>

The city filed a motion that asserted, among other things, that the recorder's court lacked jurisdiction of the case under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 726.11; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27.3561.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a warrant, city police officers conducted a raid on certain premises and seized monies, assorted drugs, and other personal property. No one was arrested. Later, the State of Michigan issued a jeopardy assessment against an allegedly different lessee of the premises. The city police department paid some of the seized monies to satisfy the assessment to the State of Michigan and the remainder to the city. Then, the lessee filed a motion in the recorder's court seeking the return of the monies that he alleged belonged solely to him. The city filed its motion. The recorder's court ordered the city to pay the lessee. The city appealed. The court reversed. It found that no arrests were made and no criminal proceedings were pending. The issuance of a search warrant was the only action taken by the recorder's court in this action. The facts in this action required the recorder's court to determine a question of title to determine the right to possession of the money seized by the police officers. Based on these facts, the action was outside of the jurisdiction of the recorder's court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court entered judgments of foreclosure against the owner in favor of appellees, with priority over the mortgage held by the mortgagee. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgments, holding that appellees were exempted from certain notice requirements under the Mechanics' Lien Act (Act) because they dealt directly with the owner or part owner of the property. The court concluded that the trial court's determination that the parties understood the payment and waiver procedure to waive any right to a lien only on work already completed was amply supported by the record, and that the liens were not waived. The court found that the mechanics' liens took priority over the mortgage because a subcontractor commenced work prior to the recording of the mortgage. The court held that the Act was constitutional because filing a mechanics' lien did not constitute a taking of a significant property interest, the lien was merely notice to others of the existence of a potential foreclosure action, and even if the taking was significant, it was minor compared to the countervailing interests of mechanics' lienors.</SPAN></P>

In the prior appeal, the seizure of the collateral was declared unconstitutional by because it was done without notice or hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank and the borrower were parties to two loans with two separate sets of loan documents. The borrower contended that the bank erroneously accelerated the balance due on the first loan because it had accepted a payment from the borrower and thereby waived its right to accelerate the balance on the note. The court held that as to the first loan, the bank had properly accelerated the entire balance of the note by filing a complaint for claim and delivery based on the accelerated balance and that the acceptance of the borrower's payment served to reduce the indebtedness but did not cure the existing default. As to the second loan, the court found that the account was current at the time the complaint was filed and therefore, the bank was precluded from accelerating the note after its acceptance of late payments. Because the collateral had already been sold, the court held that the borrower was entitled to recover damages for conversion and that the borrower could recover the value of the collateral at the time of the conversion.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed defendant's conviction of breaking and entering upon finding that breaking and entering was an essential element of the offense of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. Because both convictions arose out of the same conduct, separate convictions violated double jeopardy protections. The court affirmed defendant's conviction for first-degree criminal sexual conduct and held defendant lacked standing to raise a constitutional challenge to the language of Mich. Comp.

The evidence showed that defendant required the complainant to perform fellatio and that he was not charged with &quot;any other intrusion.&quot; Because defendant's conviction rested on the more specific language of &sect; 750.520a(h), he lacked standing to challenge the more general language on vagueness or overbreadth grounds. Defendant was not prejudiced by the jury's exposure to proposed exhibits of latent fingerprints, which were not admitted into evidence, because a crime lab technician testified that the prints could not be identified as those of defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate appealed by right from a decision of a Court of Claims (Michigan) that granted accelerated judgment, pursuant to Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 116.1(5) (1963) on two counts of his complaint, and summary judgment, pursuant to Mich. Gen. Ct. R.117.2(1) (1963), on two other counts of his complaint. The inmate's complaint was based on the loss of personal property allegedly taken by prison employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed that he was placed in a detention cell for an alleged violation of prison rules. At that time, he had a quantity of personal property in his cell. Defendant Department of Corrections (department) moved this property to the prison property room. When his property was returned after his release from detention, several items were missing. The inmate filed an action against the department, and the court of claims granted accelerated judgment on two counts of the complaint and summary judgment on two other counts, pursuant to Mich. Ct. R. 116.1(5), 117.2(1) (1963). The inmate claimed that he did not receive a copy of the summary judgment motion until after the court of claims had granted the motion. In remanding the court of claims decision, the court found that the summary judgment motion was not timely served under the applicable rules, Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 108.4, 108.6, 108.7(1). The inmate was denied due process. Finally, the court urged the court of claims to reconsider its grant of summary judgment to the department on the basis that governmental immunity precluded the inmate's suit for conversion under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 691.1407 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.996(107)).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the court of claims' decision, finding that the inmate was denied due process by a procedure, which effectively excluded any opportunity for him to be heard.</SPAN></P>

The statute did not violate due process by impermissibly shifting the burden of proof as the statute required the state to bear the burden of proof on the sanity issue after defendant presented evidence tending to overthrow the presumption of sanity. The statute did not violate due process as the trial court's findings of fact indicated that it was aware it was not required to return a special verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, but could have found defendant not guilty had the facts so warranted. Under the substantive-relation-to-the-object test, the statute did not violate the principle of equal protection under the law as it effectuated the principles that an insane person ought not be convicted of a crime when the person lacked the competency to form the intent to commit it and that protection should be afforded if the person posed a danger to others.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 750.520d, and breaking and entering an occupied dwelling with the intent to commit criminal sexual conduct in the third degree, under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 750.110.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 750.520j prohibited an inquiry into the complainant's sexual past and that it barred the admission of reputation evidence. Defendant claimed on appeal that this ruling was reversibly erroneous. On review, the court found that the statute was incorrectly applied, and it remanded the case. Under &sect; 750.520j, such reputation evidence was admissible only to the extent that it was material to a fact at issue in the case and that its inflammatory or prejudicial nature did not outweigh its probative value. The court concluded that introduction of the evidence in issue was relevant to the issue of defendant's intent on the breaking and entering charge, to show that he did not have the felonious intent claimed by the prosecutor. The court indicated that evidence could be introduced in an attempt to rebut the prosecution's claim of criminal intent with respect to one charge, and if the evidence was inappropriate with respect to another offense, a limiting instruction could be given. Rather than order a new trial, which might be useless, the court opted to remand the case for consideration of the application of the evidence under the statute.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The record showed that: (1) the mother had seen defendant spank his own children with a belt and had told defendant to spank her child if the child behaved badly; (2) defendant admitted to spanking the child; (3) the medical evidence established that the spanking was more like a beating; and (4) defendant admitted to spanking the child for a longer period of time than which he spanked his own children. The trial court did not err in admitting photographs of the child's injuries because the photographs showed the extent of a rather severe beating and were probative value of the beating because the extent of the spanking administered by defendant was strongly contested. Although the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for a hearing on the admissibility of his statements, which was made the day before trial, the error was not reversible because the testimony of the police witnesses regarding defendant's statements did not contradict, and was merely cumulative of, defendant's own testimony.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 560.222 had been construed to require two-thirds of all owners to join in a petition to vacate a plat, so plaintiffs lacked standing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owners sought to amend the subdivision plat to widen a narrow road which was impassable in winter and prevented access to emergency services vehicles to their lots.

The court reversed. Noting a conflict in the relevant statute, it found that effect could be given to both provisions if the statute was interpreted as written. The statute failed to define a distinction between &quot;amending&quot; and &quot;vacating, correcting, altering or revising.&quot; Each plaintiff was a proprietor of a lot in the subdivision, and each would have been affected by the proposed plat amendment. The statute should not have been interpreted to deny them the opportunity of having review on the merits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced twice, under different theories, for the one act of criminal sexual conduct with which he was charged.

The trial court committed reversible error in denying defendant's request for an instruction on the necessarily lesser included offense of second-degree criminal sexual conduct under Mich. Comp.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff husband and defendant wife both sought review of a judgment from the Oakland Court (Michigan) granting the wife's counter complaint for divorce and awarding the wife $ 15,000 alimony in gross to be made in three payments beginning six months after the judgment was entered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were married for seven years. During that time the husband obtained a medical degree and was presently in a surgical residency. The wife had worked as a guidance counselor in public schools during the marriage and continued in that employment. The husband claimed that the award of alimony where his wife's current earnings were greater than his own was an abuse of discretion. The wife claimed that the award should have been raised to $ 60,000 to reflect her efforts in the husband's acquisition of his medical degree. The court found that since it was impossible to award the wife a portion of the husband's medical degree, an award of $ 15,000 fairly represented the wife's contribution to the acquisition of that asset, financial and otherwise. The court found that it was inequitable for the husband to have been required to make the payments ordered by the trial court while still pursuing his medical training.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment from the trial court to require payment of $ 2,000 plus interest per year while the husband's residency continued and the balance to be paid within one year after his residency was completed. The court affirmed the balance of the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged that the statute was void for vagueness because it did not clearly describe the conduct proscribed and had a chilling effect on free speech. The court affirmed, holding that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it sufficiently informed a potential defendant that he was to refrain from conduct calculated to cause another person to commit an offense described in the statute. The words &quot;incite, induce, or exhort&quot; clearly implied imminent action and did not punish mere advocacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of third-degree criminal sexual conduct. He appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and remanded. The court held that the victim's testimony that shortly prior to the offense she observed defendant pointing a rifle at her brother was relevant and material, notwithstanding absence of any showing that defendant ever threatened her with rifle or that she noted its presence during the alleged crime. The court found that the trial court did not err in prohibiting the defense from asking the unmarried victim if she knew the father of her two children. Also, the court stated that the trial court did not err in sustaining objection to the defense questions regarding when and why the victim moved from her parents' home. The court opined that the exclusion of evidence of alleged statement by the victim's brother accusing her of being promiscuous was also not error notwithstanding defense of consent. The court articulated that the trial court erred reversibly in admitting, over objection, a pair of ripped, semen and blood-stained underpants without first establishing that the victim wore the item on the night of the attack.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and remanded. The court remanded the cause on this issue for an evidentiary hearing where the victim could confirm or deny that the underpants was the undergarment she wore at the time in question. If she so averred, defendant's conviction was affirmed. Otherwise, defendant would be entitled to a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner appealed the decision of the trial court for Washtenaw (Michigan), which entered summary judgment for defendants utility company and cable company. Defendant city appealed a summary judgment granted by the trial court to the landowner in a related action. The two actions were consolidated on appeal. The litigation concerned the installation of wires for a cable company across the utility's easement on the landowner's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner sought damages for trespass by the cable company and for an accounting from the utility for all monies paid to it by the cable company for use of its poles. The trial court granted summary judgment for the companies. On appeal, the court affirmed and found that the cable company was a public utility within the Subdivision Control Act of 1967, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 560.101 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26.430(101) et seq.). In the second action, the landowner also sued the city and alleged that its community antenna system ordinance was unconstitutional. The trial court granted summary judgment to the landowner. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the change in language and structure found in Mich. Const. art. VII, &sect; 25 (1963) as compared to Mich. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 25 (1908) reflected the intent of the framers of the 1963 constitution to make sure that the limited definition of &quot;public utility&quot; in the 1908 constitution applied. The court held that the meaning was broad enough to include community antenna television systems.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment granted to the cable and utility company in the action against it for trespass and unjust enrichment and affirmed the summary judgment granted to the landowner in its claim against the city that its ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Gratiot Trial Court (Michigan) finding him guilty but mentally ill after a trial for assault with intent to commit murder. Defendant contended that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 768.36 was unconstitutional under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Michigan Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether defendant was deprived of his right to equal protection by the classification of guilty but mentally ill. Defendant contended that a person who was mentally ill at the time of committing a crime who did not plead insanity could not have been found guilty but mentally ill. The court found that if defendant's counsel thought his client was mentally ill at the time of the crime, he would have pleaded insanity in order to get a verdict of guilty but mentally ill. If defendant was claiming insanity at the time of the offense and it was factually possible that he was sane and guilty but mentally ill at the time of the commission of the offense, the legislature could have insisted on such a classification. Defendant also complained that the trier of fact &quot;may&quot; have found defendant guilty but mentally ill, and not that it &quot;must&quot; have found him guilty but mentally ill. The court held that the jurors, who made no detailed findings of fact, could have been instructed that if the required elements were proven beyond a reasonable doubt, their verdict would have been guilty but mentally ill.</SPAN></P>

Defendant, plaintiff's insurer, filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that motorcycles were excluded from the Act. The trial court granted summary judgment on the first count, allowed plaintiff to amend the second count, and determined that the repayment provision was unlawful. Plaintiff appealed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reheard defendant insurers' appeal from the judgments of the lower court (Michigan), which ordered defendants to pay no-fault benefits to plaintiff insureds and held that the $ 5000 deductible clause in the insurance policy was invalid under the Michigan no-fault insurance act, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 500.3109(3); Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24.13109(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two cases were consolidated on appeal because both involved recovery by plaintiff motorcyclist where plaintiff collided with an automobile covered by a no-fault policy and where plaintiff was covered by a no-fault policy issued by defendant insurers on the family car containing a $ 5,000 deductible on the personal protection insurance. The lower court ordered defendants to pay the no-fault benefits to plaintiffs, and defendants appealed. The court on review found that the deductible provision of the Michigan no-fault insurance act, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 500.3109(3), Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24.13109(3), could be interpreted two different ways, as allowing the commissioner to authorize the conditions of applying the $ 300 statutory deductible amount but not to increase the deductible amount, or alternatively, as permitting the commissioner to increase the deductible amount, which would be unconstitutional. The court held that under either interpretation the $ 5,000 deductible clause in the policy was invalid, and affirmed the judgment that plaintiffs could recover for injuries exceeding $ 300.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's judgments, finding the statute could be interpreted either as only allowing the commissioner to authorize the conditions of applying a $ 300 statutory deductible amount, or unconstitutionally permitting the commissioner to increase the deductible amount, but either way the $ 5,000 deductible clause was invalid, so plaintiffs should recover for injuries exceeding $ 300.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was injured when she was a passenger on a motorcycle. No other vehicles were involved in the accident. She sought to recover from defendant insurer, who carried the no-fault automobile insurance on plaintiff's father's motor vehicles. The trial court granted summary judgment for defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed. The definition of motor vehicle for no-fault insurance purposes, as set out in Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 500.3101(2), was not unconstitutional because it excluded motorcycles. The legislative classification was not essentially arbitrary because the legislature protected all class members whom it intended to protect and the motorcycle exclusion reduced the overall cost of the no-fault program. If an automobile had been involved in the accident, plaintiff could have recovered from the insurer of that automobile's owner but not from her father's insurer. Since no automobile was involved, plaintiff was left with her basic tort remedies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer was discharged by the city manager and chief of police following an investigation of allegations that he had misused funds of a police association while acting as its secretary. The police officer requested a review by the board, which ordered the police officer reinstated. The city manager requested a review by the commission. The commission voted to discharge the police officer after a meeting between the commission and the board to which the police officer was not invited. The police officer sought superintending control in the circuit court. The circuit court affirmed the board's finding and ordered the police officer reinstated. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the city's civil service code violated the police officer's equal protection rights because it allowed the city manager to have appealed the decision to the commission, but it did not allow the police officer to have appealed a decision. Because the police officer, as a public employee, had a property right in his employment, he was entitled to due process safeguards.

The taxpayers contended that the Tax Tribunal Act violated Mich.

The court stated that examination of the Tax Tribunal Act showed that no law was revised, altered, or amended merely by title. No other law was mentioned. The mischief designed to be remedied by Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 25 (1963), namely, misleading the public and the legislature as to the intent of the legislation, was not present. The Tax Tribunal Act fell within the general tax law and was easily discoverable. It did not confuse or mislead; it stated what it purported to do in explicit language.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that he was deprived of a fair trial and due process of law when a single criminal incident resulted in his trial on four separate counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. The principal issue was whether a single sexual penetration, accompanied by more than one of the statute's enumerated special circumstances, properly resulted in two distinct criminal charges. The court found that this was controlled by a determination of legislative intent, which it found demonstrated an intent to tighten the legislative provisions regarding criminal sexual conduct. Thus, the court held that the statute should have been interpreted to punish separately each violation of one of the separate interests, and this interpretation was constitutional. The court additionally found that the sentences were within the range of sentences normally given for these offenses and that the offenses charged were not lesser included offenses of each other. Thus, the court held that since there were four separate and distinct offenses, the constitutional prohibition against being twice put in jeopardy for the same offense did not apply.</SPAN></P>

The insured had been killed in a car accident while she was working for the employer and under circumstances giving rise to a claim for workers' compensation benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In seeking recovery from the employer, the insurer had claimed that it was entitled to subtract the payable workers' compensation benefits from any payments due under the policy, even though the insured's beneficiaries had refused to file for such benefits. The trial court had ruled that &sect; 3109(1) of the no-fault act, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 500.3109(1), was void as violative of the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The trial court thus had determined that the employer was entitled to summary judgment because the insurer had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. In affirming, the court held that &sect; 500.3109(1) made an arbitrary classification between those entitled to benefits collateral to recovery on a no-fault policy. The disparity in treatment between government-mandated benefits, which were subject to subtraction, and collateral benefits payable from privately purchased insurance policies, which were not subject to subtraction, bore no reasonable relationship to the objective of the legislation. Accordingly, &sect; 500.3109(1) was properly held to be constitutionally repugnant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both a township and the village submitted petitions to the Commission for the creation of cities from the township and village. After appropriate proceedings, the Commission granted the township's petition for incorporation as a new home rule city but adjusted the boundaries of the new City of Commerce to include the entire village. The village's petition for incorporation was denied. The village contended that the Commission had adopted a &quot;rule&quot; within the meaning of the Administrative Procedures Act of 1969, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 24.207, disfavoring the creation or expansion of small cities within the metropolitan area counties without complying with the procedures mandated by the APA. The court concluded that with the emphasis on future growth and ability to provide services, it was inevitable that the Commission would have favored a municipality with open space and a large tax base relative to population. The court concluded that the bias against small communities arose as much from the statute as it did from the Commission policy, but that the legislative choice was a political one and not subject to judicial review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute at issue prohibited attorneys from soliciting personal injury claims.

The court held that a statute which either forbade or required the doing of an act in terms so vague that people of common intelligence had to necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application, violated the first essential of due process of law; and that the law failed to meet the requirements of the due process clause because it was so vague and standardless that it left the public uncertain as to the conduct it prohibited and left judges and jurors free to decide, without any legally fixed standards, what was prohibited and what was not in each particular case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant state dental board sought review of a judgment from a trial court (Michigan), which granted summary judgment to plaintiff dental hygienists on their declaratory judgment action and ruled that the dental hygienists were entitled to the same constitutional protections as licensed dentists.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dental hygienists had filed a declaratory judgment action that sought to prevent the state dental board from supervising, licensing and examining dental hygienists. The trial court granted summary judgment to the dental hygienists and ruled that the dental hygienists were entitled to the same constitutional protections as licensed dentists. On appeal, the court ruled that the trial judge properly denied the state dental board's original motion for accelerated judgment in that the trial court possessed proper jurisdiction to entertain the suit. Next, the court found the trial court had erred in granting the dental hygienists' motion for summary judgment. The court found the pleadings had revealed a genuine issue as to a material fact in regards to whether or not the dental hygienists were professional persons. The court ruled that, as a matter of law, the practice of dental hygiene could not be classified as a profession, separate and distinct from the practice of dentistry. The court concluded that the dental hygienists were not entitled to summary judgment in this case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The director rejected the proposed articles of incorporation because the interest rates they proposed to charge borrowers from the proposed corporation were usurious. However, the individual argued that the director did not have legal authority to reject proposed articles of incorporation. The individual also argued that state usury statutes were unconstitutional. On review, the court affirmed the order granting the director's motion for summary judgment. In reaching its conclusion, the court held that Business Corporation Act (BCA), MCLA 450.1101 et seq.; MSA 21.200(101) et seq., gave the director the implied right to reject proposed articles of incorporation that did not comply with the BCA. The court held that because the interest rates were usurious under state law, the proposed articles did not comply with the BCA and the director acted properly in rejecting them. The court then relied on the weight of caselaw in holding that the state's usury laws were constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the department's motion for accelerated judgment, grounded on sovereign immunity pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 691.1407. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' decedent committed suicide while on a temporary visit to his parents' home.

The court held that plaintiff failed to plead facts in the complaint in avoidance of immunity. Therefore, the specific tortious activity alleged against the state or its agencies was within the protection of the sovereign immunity doctrine. Further, the court refused to find Mich. Comp.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dentist's unprofessional conduct consisted of writing prescriptions for a controlled substance in the name of individuals who then gave the drug to the dentist for his own use. The dentist testified that he used the drug due to chronic mastoiditis. The dentist argued that &sect; 18 of the Dentistry Act relied upon by the Board as authority for revoking his license was so lacking in definitive standards as to be violative of the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The court found that at the hearing, the Board called no witnesses, and that exhibits were introduced into the record consisting of several prescriptions written by the dentist. The court found that the only argument made by the attorney for the Board was the conclusory statement that the dentist had abused his license to practice dentistry in that it had been shown he prescribed and used certain drugs for himself. The court held that by its wording, &sect; 18(n) gave the Board virtual carte blanche in determining what conduct resulted in revocation of a dentist's license. The court found that Mich. Comp.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted under Mich. Comp.

On appeal, the court reversed defendant's conviction and determined that the statutory inference contained in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.230 was an unconstitutional violation of due process.

The Department rehired him in 1965. In 1976, the Commission adopted rules pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 38.512 governing the promotion of police officers and firefighters. Pursuant to the rules, the officer's employment with the Department before 1965 was not considered in determining his eligibility for promotions. The officer filed an action against the Commission, claiming that the rules were an unconstitutional violation of equal protection because they favored continuous employment over interrupted employment. The trial court entered a judgment for the Commission. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the rules did not violate the officer's constitutional right to equal protection. The court determined that the distinction in the rules between continuous and interrupted employment was reasonably related to the purpose of operating orderly and efficient police and fire departments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried before a jury on a charge of larceny by conversion. The trial judge found that the prosecution had failed to prove title to the money allegedly converted in the person from whom it was charged defendant converted the money. On this basis, the trial judge dismissed the cause and quashed the proceedings. The record supported the finding of the trial judge that title had not been proved. Thus there was a failure of proof on an essential element of the crime with which defendant was charged and for which he was tried. Dismissal was proper and was tantamount to acquittal on the merits. When the jury was sworn, defendant was placed in jeopardy. He has been tried on the merits, and, in effect, he has been acquitted. A second trial on the merits would place him twice in jeopardy, and a second trial on the merits would be the only relief available if The State prevailed on the appeal. The second trial would be prohibited by the constitutional provisions on double jeopardy. The double jeopardy argument of defendant was correct and bared this appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the trial court of Branch County (Michigan), judgment of conviction for felony nonsupport. He argued, inter alia, that: (1) he did not &quot;leave the state&quot; after &quot;refusing or neglecting&quot; to pay support within the meanings of those phrases under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 750.165; and (2) his inability to pay barred prosecution under the statute, as &quot;neglect&quot; and &quot;refusal&quot; presupposed the ability to pay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of refusing to pay support and leaving the state. He was sentenced to prison. The court reversed. Defendant maintained that he had no income for almost two years, having been unemployed. He argued that the trial court had uncontroverted evidence of his inability to pay and should have ruled it a valid defense and so instructed the jury. The court agreed. As this was dispositive, the date of his leaving the state was irrelevant in this case. The court noted that to complete the statutory crime, refusal to pay must have been coupled with flight from the state, which must have occurred after the refusal to pay. Noting that the felony nonsupport statute had not yet been interpreted by the appellate court, the court adopted the reasoning in an attorney general's opinion and analogized to an out of state case, finding that inability to pay was a defense under the statute. The difference between Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 750.165 and the state's other nonsupport statutes was defendant's absence from the state. Fleeing to avoid payment was a strict liability crime, but the trial court erred in ruling that ability to pay was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded. The court held that inability to pay was a defense to statutory felony nonsupport. It also found that the statute required that refusal or neglect to pay be coupled with flight from the state, but that this was not relevant to disposition of defendant's appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution arose from the aborted sale of a swimming pool to the complaining witness. The state based its case on bank records which showed the deposit of the complaining witness's downpayment check in defendant's overdrawn account and the use of the funds the very next day, before any work was done on the complaining witness's pool. On appeal, defendant alleged that there was insufficient evidence supporting his conviction and that the building contract fund act was unconstitutional. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 570.153 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26.333) laborers and materialmen were unpaid in violation of the statute when defendant spent the complaining witness's downpayment without hiring anyone to do work on her pool. The court further held that the building contract fund act was not unconstitutionally vague because the act clearly established a trust as to monies paid to a contractor, and the statute's allowance of some measure of discretion in handling the trust fund did not render the statute vague. The court summarily dispensed with defendant's remaining arguments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial judge's instruction was incomplete and reversibly erroneous because it failed to state the significance that the asportation had to be independent. The court found that the trial judge not only failed to instruct the jury that the significance of the asportation had to be independent, he also failed to instruct that complicated movement and increased danger, or a threat thereof, were factors to be considered in determining whether the movement constituted the necessary legal asportation. The court concluded that the trial judge's failure to include the object of the predicate could not have been excused. Whether a particular movement constituted the requisite asportation was a question of fact for the jury to be determined under the appropriate standards. The trial judge's incomplete asportation instruction did not adequately convey the standards, and therefore, defendant's conviction had to be reversed. The court disagreed with defendant's argument that the trial court failed to produce all res gestae witness because they were not res gestae witnesses.

The issue of first impression was whether the legislative amendment codified at Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 418.435, permitting an injured worker's last employer to seek apportionment of damages from the Fund, was retroactive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for over 26 years for a foundry before its insolvency, but he worked for less than four weeks for the employer at its foundry. It was found that, as a result of his work, that he was disabled by a back injury and injury to his lungs from dust. He sought workers' compensation twice, after trying to return to work but being unable to perform the job. His amended petition for workers' compensation added his new employer along with the insolvent employer and the Self-Insurers' Security Fund. Initially, the insolvent employer and the Fund were ordered to accept full liability for the disability. In 1973 the order was modified to order the second employer to pay benefits, without reimbursement from the Fund. That employer appealed. The court held that the provisions of 1972 Mich. Pub. Act 337 were remedial and thus retroactive. The legislation was amendatory, expanding an existing remedy. The Fund was a creature of the legislature, so the sole issue was legislative intent. It also found that the evidence was sufficient to support the finding that the employee's brief time with the second employer contributed to his back injury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ruling was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court held that the legislative amendment was to be given retroactive effect as it was remedial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer sought a writ of mandamus to compel defendant Department of Treasury to return money seized under a jeopardy sales tax assessment and/or compelling defendant state Board of Tax Appeals to hold a hearing concerning that assessment. Money that had been seized from the taxpayer's home after a search by police officers acting pursuant to a search warrant was applied to a jeopardy sales tax assessment requested after the search.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A recorder's court held that seizure of the taxpayer's money was beyond the search warrant's scope and ordered it returned to him. He asked the department for a hearing and was advised, by form letter, that his request was timely. The department had for a long time treated hearings on jeopardy assessments as if they were appeals from an intent to assess. However, after his appeal, the department decided it did not have jurisdiction to hold a hearing on a jeopardy assessment. He was told that because of the change, he could file an appeal within 30 days from the department's notice. Despite the fact that he did so, his appeal was dismissed. On appeal, the court held that no writ would issue for the return of the money because doing so would not eliminate the ultimate question of the validity of the jeopardy assessment. However, a writ would issue for a hearing on his challenge to the assessment. Because the department changed its policies mid-stream, it was inequitable to leave the taxpayer with no remedy. His reliance on the department's advice was reasonable and justifiable. Further, nothing in the applicable appeal statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 205.7, prohibited the hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued a writ of mandamus that ordered a hearing on the taxpayer's challenge to the jeopardy sales tax assessment. The court retained jurisdiction, but remanded the matter to the board for a hearing to be held within 60 days after the release date of the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The city's petition requested an increase in an assessment after the assessment rolls were finalized by the Board; thus, it was not an appeal from the Board.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant insurer appealed a decision of a Wayne trial court (Michigan) that prevented the insurer from reducing benefits payable to plaintiff insured under an automobile insurance policy. The trial court held that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 500.3109(1), a provision of the Michigan no-fault act, was unconstitutional. At the time of an accident, the insured's policy provided for personal injury protection benefits pursuant to the no-fault act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the accident, the insured was paid a monthly sum as work loss benefits. He was later determined to be totally disabled. Pursuant to &sect; 500.3109(1) and a provision of the policy, the insurer began to deduct the amount of the Social Security benefits from the work loss benefits. The insured contended that &sect; 500.3109(1), which provided for the deduction of government benefits from any personal injury protection insurance benefits, was unconstitutional. He also contended that the policy provision to the same effect was contrary to the intent of the law and was thus unenforceable. The trial court agreed and declared not only that &sect; 500.3109(1) was unconstitutional, but that the policy provision was invalid and unenforceable. On appeal, the court sustained the trial court's decision and held that &sect; 500.3109(1) violated the Equal Protection provisions of the United States and Michigan Constitutions. The court found no legitimate purpose for establishing a distinction that arbitrarily discriminated against those who received certain government benefits. The court noted that both parties had agreed that the provision of the policy was virtually identical to &sect; 500.3109(1).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers appealed from a judgment of a circuit court (Michigan), which granted summary judgment for defendant Department of Treasury (Michigan) in the taxpayers' action to have two provisions of the Income Tax Act of 1967, the property tax credit, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 206.522(1)(a), and the sales tax credit, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 206.523(1)(a), declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers contended that the 3.5 percent of household income limitation for a property tax credit and the city income tax credit provision created an impermissible graduated income tax, which violated Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 7, and the uniformity requirement of Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 3. They also contended that the tax violated the equal protection guarantees of both the Michigan and United States Constitutions. The court found that the actual credit allowed depended on both household income and a taxpayer's property tax liability. Once having computed the credit, it was allowed against tax liability without regard to the amount of a taxpayer's income. The court rejected the taxpayers' contention that the credit formula gave lower credits to otherwise qualified taxpayers solely because they had higher income. It found that the tax law did not violate the uniformity or equal protection requirements of the Michigan and United States Constitutions. The court concluded that the taxpayers had failed to overcome the presumption of constitutional validity inherent in the statutory provision. It declined to pass upon the constitutionality of the sales tax credit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction, which was based on the beating of a two-year old child. On review, the court affirmed. The court held that defendant did not have standing to challenge Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 326.8(b). That statute provided that where a person's respiratory and circulatory functions were maintained by artificial means of support, that person was considered dead where there was irreversible cessation of spontaneous brain function. Defendant had no personal interest in the constitutionality of the statute, because, even if the statute were unconstitutional, defendant's conviction would stand. It was clear the child was dead before the respirator was turned off. Even if the respirator was stopped prematurely, defendant would still be liable. An intervening medical error was not a defense when one inflicted a mortal wound upon another. The trial court properly excluded the jailer's statement of what defendant said his wife said during a telephone conversation. The jailer overheard only defendant's side of the conversation. A self-serving hearsay statement corroborating a defendant's testimony was not admissible under any hearsay exception.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 750.520b(1)(e) (Mich. Stat. Ann &sect; 28.788(2)(1)(e)). Defendant contended that the trial court committed reversible error when it limited cross-examination of the complainant under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.520j (Mich. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's trial, his counsel was able to elicit from the complainant that an act of sexual intercourse was not something new to her. The trial court sustained the prosecution's objection, holding that questioning the complainant about her prior sexual activity with persons other than defendant was prohibited under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.520j (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.788(10)). On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction because evidence of the complainant's prior sexual activity could not be used to attack her veracity. While the Sixth Amendment guaranteed a right to confront witnesses, defendant's inability to explore complainant's sexual past in order to attack her veracity did not impair his cross-examination of her in any meaningful way. The trial court's refusal to allow the line of questioning did not impermissibly limit defendant from substantiating his version of the encounter. Defendant did not attempt to produce witnesses to testify about complainant's reputation for chastity. The court noted that if defendant had offered such evidence and if that evidence were not admitted, a more serious constitutional question would have arisen.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant townships brought an action against appellee Muskegon County Drain Commissioner seeking a judgment declaring an assessment void and equitable relief in the nature of an injunction requiring a drain tax levy as originally apportioned. The Muskegon Circuit Court (Michigan) dismissed the townships' action for failure to comply with the time requirements of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 280.161, and the townships appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After property owners objected to the original assessment, a board of review was appointed pursuant to the Michigan Drain Code. Five months after its first meeting that board filed its report with the probate court that appointed it and the Commissioner was sent a copy. The report lowered the current assessment for the property owners and raised it for the townships. The townships complained that they were not given formal notice of the report before receiving the unexpected assessments. The court pointed out that the townships had notice of and were present at the board of review meetings. They heard, or at least had an opportunity to hear, the arguments presented. The court reasoned that the townships knew that a determination was going to be made, and that it was final. Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 280.161. The court found that the lack of official notice of the report did not deny the townships due process. The court added that the townships were aware of the dispute, and regardless of their desire to maintain the status quo, it was possible that the decision would have adversely affected them by raising their assessments to lower those of the property owners.</SPAN></P>

The State filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that the waiver of immunity under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 691.1402 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.996(102)) did not provide for recovery for injuries resulting in death. On appeal of the order granting the motion, the court ruled that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 691.1402 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.996(102)) abrogated immunity for wrongful death actions as well as claims for bodily injury. The court also ruled that, since that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 691.1402 (Mich.

The owner of the vehicle failed to pay the parking ticket. The city filed a complaint against her. A city attorney and the parking enforcement officer appeared before appellee judge and requested that an arrest warrant be issued for the owner's failure to pay the ticket or appear in court. The judge found that there was no probable cause for issuance of the warrant as there was no rational relationship between the facts presented and probable cause to believe that the owner committed the offense. The judge further found that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 257.675a, requiring the trial court to accept certain proof as establishing probable cause, was unconstitutional as contrary to the separation of powers doctrine established by the state constitution. The city sought an order of superintending control in the circuit court directing the judge to issue the arrest warrant. The circuit court refused to issue the arrest warrant. The court affirmed the judgment, by holding that the judge had an inherent power to exercise his discretion in the issuance of arrest warrants, and such discretion was not abused.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of a decision from the Circuit Court for the County of Washtenaw (Michigan), in which defendants were granted an order of superintending control which deemed a previously challenged city ordinance to be a valid enactment and of consequence to the charge pending against defendants, to wit, possession of marijuana with intent to deliver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon the request of a city police officer, the assistant county prosecutor authorized the prosecution of defendants on the charge of possession of marijuana with intent to deliver. Defendants filed motions to dismiss the charges, claiming that the prosecution of such contravened a city ordinance that required the taking of such cases to the city attorney instead, and the district court denied the motions and voided the ordinance in its entirety. Defendants sought an order of superintending control in the circuit court, which was granted and deemed the ordinance to be a valid enactment in defendants' and all other cases. The state appealed and the court vacated the circuit court's order, holding that because the circuit court's order upholding the ordinance had not issued when the district judge denied defendants' motions thereto, there was no circuit court order extant that could bind the district judge. The court found that the ordinance impermissibly restrained city police officers from enforcing state law by preventing them from complaining to anyone other than the city attorney about marijuana violations, and thus it could not serve as a bar to defendants' prosecutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the circuit court's order of superintending control and ordered that the prosecution of defendants for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute could proceed because the ordinance could not serve as a bar to defendants' prosecution.</SPAN></P>

The drug, although not specified as a controlled substance in schedule two, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 335.316, was added as a schedule two controlled substance under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 335.315. Defendants argued that the authority granted by the legislature to the State Board of Pharmacy to designate the drug a controlled substance constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative power to an administrative agency. The court disagreed and reversed the trial court's dismissal of charges against defendants for delivery of a controlled substance. The court held that the standards provided to the Board under the Controlled Substances Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 335.301, et seq., were as reasonably precise as the subject matter required and contained guidelines that were readily understandable to experienced pharmacists. The court held that the need for both legislative and administrative flexibility was essential to deal with the state's drug abuse problem.

The court found that a plain reading of the ordinance excluded the company president from its coverage, and the prosecution against him should have been dismissed on that ground. The court noted that the company president was not a person in authority, employee, or attendant at any gas station as required by the ordinance. Further, the court indicated that the company president had general supervisory control over the company's operations. The court ruled that the words &quot;manager, operator or supervisor of any gas station&quot; could legitimately be construed to mean a person who oversaw the daily operation of a gas station and not a person who only controlled the operation of gas stations from a distance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the first murder in federal district court and the second murder in the trial court. Thereafter, the charges for the first murder were dismissed, and the trial court committed defendant as a criminal sexual psychopathic person for the second murder. After the criminal sexual psychopath statute was repealed, defendant was paroled. Thereafter, nearly eight years after the crimes were committed, the county prosecutor reactivated charges against defendant for the second murder and, for the first time, instituted a charge of murder against defendant for the first murder. Upon review, the court held that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motions to quash and to dismiss the charges. Notions of fairness embodied in both the constitutional provisions against ex post facto laws and the due process clauses prevented the repeal of the criminal sexual psychopath statute from eliminating the defense against prosecution available to defendant when he was committed. In addition, the delay between the date of the first murder and the date of trial prevented the prosecution for that crime because defendant would have suffered undue prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, State Department of Public Health, sought review of a judgment of the circuit court (Michigan), which enjoined it from refusing to approve plaintiff apartment owner's plans and specifications and from refusing to issue permits for the construction and operation of a public swimming pool at the apartment complex.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The apartment owner began construction of a pool and bathhouse without first obtaining a permit as required by Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 325.606. The department subsequently indicated how the plans could be modified. The apartment's pool contractor brought in plans that had been prepared by a registered engineer but the department refused to approve the plans. The apartment owner filed a complaint for mandamus in the trial court alleging an arbitrary and unreasonable refusal by the department in refusing to issue permits. The complaint prayed for an order requiring the department to approve the plans and specifications and to issue a construction permit for the completion of the bathhouse and swimming pool. The trial court issued this order. On review, court reversed and remanded. The court held that the trial court was without jurisdiction to grant the order because trial courts did not have jurisdiction in mandamus against a state officer under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 600.4401 and Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 714.1(1) (1963). Pursuant to Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 820.1(7) (1963) the court granted the mandamus motion and issued the same order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the mandamus action and ordered that the apartment owner be allowed to operate the swimming pool. The court also ordered the department from interfering with the operation of the swimming pool and bathhouse so long as it was operated in compliance with the order.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that the residents' interests arose from their status as adjoining and neighboring property owners and their interests in the rezoning of a parcel of land in close proximity was not significant because nearby property owners had no vested interest in zoning classifications. The court found that in balancing the residents' rights to notice against economy and practicality in determining the form of notice, that notice by publication was sufficient.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation was the holder of a class C liquor license.

Numerous instances of accosting and soliciting for purposes of prostitution had occurred on the premises of the bar. The trial court made no findings that the bar was a house of prostitution or that any sex acts for hire had occurred on the premises, and no evidence of those types of activities were presented at the trial. The trial court erred in reading &quot;assignation&quot; as including the making of an appointment for purposes of prostitution, and, thus, including the act of soliciting for prostitution. The statutory term &quot;assignation&quot; had to be read as being synonymous with &quot;prostitution,&quot; thus, referring to the performance of sexual acts for profit. The bar was not a house of prostitution. Thus, it could not have been ordered closed as a nuisance under the abatement statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had intercourse with his 13-year-old sister-in-law against her will. He was arrested and, while in custody, he confessed. He was convicted of criminal sexual conduct and the court affirmed. The statute was not void for vagueness as the term &quot;affinity&quot; was not an unusual or esoteric word and the statute did use the term in an uncommon or extraordinary context. Further, as it was a crime to have intercourse with a female under 16 years of age prior to the enactment of the challenged statute, there was little merit to defendant's position that he lacked adequate notice that his acts constituted a criminal offense. The court also found that the term &quot;penetration&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague as the standard set by the definition of penetration was not so vague as to leave the public without a concrete estimate of its legal meaning. Additionally, defendant's motion to suppress his confession was properly denied as the record reflected that he was informed of his rights on two separate occasions, he was literate and had finished the ninth grade, there were no threats or inducements made by the police, and defendant read the typewritten statement and found no inaccuracies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecutor appealed a decision by the Circuit Court of Oakland County (Michigan), which granted the motion for summary judgment by defendants, the owners-lessors, under Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 117.2(1), (3) (1963), on the grounds that the complaint failed to allege that the owners knew of an alleged illegal activity of prostitution, and that there was no factual basis to find that the owners of the premises had such knowledge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecutor filed an action under a Michigan &quot;padlock&quot; statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 600.3801 et seq, alleging that certain premises owned by the owners, leased by defendant lessee, and possessed by defendant associated individuals were being used as a house of prostitution. The court held that pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 600.3815, where proof of knowledge was unnecessary; allegations of the owners' knowledge were not required to state a statutory cause of action. The court found that the padlock statute passed constitutional muster because it served several legitimate purposes without imposing an unreasonable forfeiture. The court reasoned that closing the premises for up to one year prevented illegal reuse of the property and substantially decreased any profit derived from criminal activity. Even though innocent, defendants might have been negligent in failing to discover a flagrant misconduct alleged; the padlock statute would encourage them to be more careful in the future. The court determined that the confiscation threatened by the padlock statute was at most a temporary deprivation of use of the premises and forfeiture of the furnishings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was incarcerated in the city's jail with another inmate. The inmate then beat the decedent to death. Subsequently, the administrator filed suit against the city. The city contended that it was immune from liability under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 691.1407. However, the administrator contended that the statute violated constitutional due process and equal protection clauses. On review, the court affirmed the trial court's order granting the city's motion for summary judgment on the basis of statutory immunity. In reaching its conclusion, the court held that the statute was not unconstitutional to the extent that it conferred immunity upon the city for its performance of uniquely governmental functions. Because the operation of a jail was one such function, the court held that the statute was valid in the case at issue. The court then held that the administrator's nuisance claim did not constitute a cause of action in the case at issue because it was clear from the facts of the case that the city was not maintaining a nuisance per se.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city challenged the decision of the circuit court (Michigan), which ruled that with the exception of city ordinance violations and small claims actions arising within the city all cases could be heard by defendant judges at any location within the geographical limits of the 37th judicial district. Additionally, the judges sought review of the trial court's ruling that they were not entitled to costs and attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city brought its action against the judges, seeking a declaration of rights with regard to the location of the 37th District Court. After the city's municipal court was abolished, the judges ceased to hold court on a full time basis in the city. After the trial court held that the judges only had to hold city ordinance violations and small claims action in the city, the city appealed. On appeal, the court held that in third class districts, such as the city, the district court must sit at each city having a population of 3,250. Next, the court noted that the city had a population of over 10,000. Therefore, the court held that the district court must sit in the city. The court then found no error in the trial court's decision requiring the judges to sit in city for city ordinance violations and small claims cases arising out of the city. However, the court found that criminal matters such as city ordinance and charter violations, arraignments on warrants from the city, and preliminary examinations on all offenses committed in the city, must also be heard in the city. Lastly, the court found not fault in the trial court's decision denying the judges' request of costs and fees.</SPAN></P>

Full privileges would be restored if he received no citations for five months. He had an accident in which he was cited, and the police officer took his license. The driver filed a motion to amend the order of restoration regarding the citations, which was denied. The state dismissed the citation. On appeal, the court reversed the order denying the motion and remanded the case for a hearing on the citation. The court held that where the state sought to summarily remove a driver from the road, due process mandated that the state provide a prompt post-revocation hearing to afford the driver &quot;rudimentary due process.&quot; The court concluded that once granted, the probationary license could not be revoked upon mere reevaluation of the prior driving record and that even if the citation represented a sufficient prior determination of cause for suspension there was no provision for any post-suspension hearing on that citation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with and convicted of the offense of delivery of phencyclidine. On appeal, defendant argued that Mich. Comp.

The court concluded that the trial court erred when it determined that no exception existed. The court held that defendant was entitled to an evidentiary hearing at which defendant had the burden of coming forward with some competent evidence to show that he was within the exception set forth in Mich. Admin. Code r. &sect; 338.3129 (1973). Defendant also argued that it was error to submit the issue of entrapment to the jury and that he was entitled to a new trial. The State agreed this was error, but argued that defendant was only entitled to an evidentiary hearing. The court noted that there was a conflict in the case law, but agreed with the State that defendant was entitled to an evidentiary hearing at which he had the burden of proof to show that he was entrapped.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the property owner's petition. The City claimed on appeal that the Board had discretion to deny the license.

He subsequently filed a motion to reopen his conviction, challenging the propriety of using his prior convictions that were obtained in violation of his right to assistance of counsel. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that defendant was entitled to a hearing to establish whether his prior convictions were unconstitutionally obtained. The prosecution's affidavit alleged that defendant was represented by counsel for one conviction, that he had effectively waived counsel for another conviction, and that in all likelihood he was probably unrepresented for the other three prior convictions. Thus, if only two prior convictions were valid, they would have been misdemeanors and the current offense would have been his first felony conviction. The court found that defendant had met his burden to show that a previous conviction was invalidly obtained, which shifted the burden to the prosecution to establish the constitutional validity of the prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 9.2805) was not unconstitutional on equal protection grounds for not allowing persons injured by hit-and-run drivers to bring actions for pain and suffering. The traditional &quot;reasonable relation&quot; equal protection test was applicable because the system of no-fault insurance was still experimental. The statute's purposes, to prevent duplicative recovery and to prevent an unlimited drain of state resources, were facially valid, and the method selected to accomplish them was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

The bicyclist brought an action pursuant Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 257.1112 for the recovery of noneconomic damages stemming from an accident with a hit-and-run driver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">No one in the bicyclist's household owned a no-fault insurance policy, which left her with no one to sue for &quot;noneconomic&quot; damages caused by the hit-and-run accident. The bicyclist argued that a 1974 amendment to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 257.1105 was unconstitutional on both equal protection and due process grounds because it barred her claim against the Fund established by Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 257.1101 et seq. The court first held that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 257.1105 was not invalid on equal protection grounds. The court then rejected the bicyclist's argument that, having created the Fund, the legislature could not have constitutionally abolished it without providing some equivalent remedy. The court ruled that because the amendment of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 257.1105 did not affect any vested property right held by the bicyclist, her due process argument had no merit. The court affirmed the judgment, noting that the abolished statutory right, though a valuable right, was not a vested right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers had sold gas-burning appliances and volumes of natural gas and paid corporate income tax on such sales under protest. The taxpayers, in computing its tax return, relied &sect; 206.271 and excluded from otherwise taxable income the gain on the sale of the gas and appliances. The trial court disallowed a refund because it found that the intent of &sect; 271 did not produce a &quot;capital gain&quot; from the sale of inventory entitling the taxpayers to a deduction from gross income. The court agreed and affirmed the disallowance of the refund holding that had the legislature intended to so fundamentally depart from the federal accounting and tax practices, it would have done so in precise language. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court with regard to permitting the taxpayers annual depreciation of emergency facilities that had been fully depreciated for federal tax but were still in use and operation in the conduct of the taxpayers' utility businesses holding that &sect; 271 equated the dollar amount of taxable income for state income tax purposes with the dollar amount of the taxable income for federal income tax purposes.</SPAN></P>

Although insurance premiums had been paid through the time of the decedent's death, the business, which had been a partnership until the decedent's mother died, was a sole proprietorship at the time of the decedent's death. As a sole proprietor, it was impossible for the decedent to come within the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1969. The decedent was the sole owner, the sole employer, and was incapable of being an employee under a contract of hire. Therefore, his resulting death was not compensable under Michigan's workmen's compensation law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission sought to build a highway. It purchased the necessary lots. The adjacent lot owners alleged that restrictive covenants existed limiting the use of the lots to single family dwellings. The Commission did not purchase the owners' restriction rights and did not begin eminent domain proceedings regarding them. The owners successfully brought suit. The court affirmed on appeal, finding no error. The court found that the owners would have no adequate remedy at law. Injunctive relief was proper because the Commission had a constitutional obligation to first acquire the deed restriction rights by eminent domain proceedings or voluntary purchase agreements. The owners were not relegated to making claims after the fact. In addition, no harm to the state from delay would ensue. The Commission had available to it a speedy statutory remedy under the &quot;quick take&quot; condemnation statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 213.361; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8.261(1). In any event, the possible injury to the state was subservient to the owners' constitutionally created right to compensation.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the bases for a denial of a license under the municipality's ordinance were reasonable and constitutional. The court also determined that the ordinance did not violate the concept of equal protection as there was not distinction between classes of persons, which was not founded on rationality.

The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state-owned lands at issue formed part of one of the few remaining favorable habitats for wildlife. The corporation's application for a drilling permit was denied on grounds that, inter alia, drilling would cause serious damage to animal life and molesting or spoiling of state-owned lands, and a forest management plan was at that time being completed. The commission upheld the denial, concluding that a well in the subject area would have damaged the surface, soils, animals, fish or aquatic life, and would have resulted in waste. On appeal, the corporation raised a variety of arguments, including lack of statutory authority for the denial, lack of substantial evidence in the record supporting the commission's factual findings, an unconstitutional taking of property and impairment of a contract obligation, estoppel, and denial of equal protection of the law. The court affirmed, holding, inter alia, that the commission's actions were within its statutory powers and not constitutionally prohibited. Moreover, as the lease stated that it was subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Conservation, the denial of a drilling permit was contemplated by the lease.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped after a police officer observed the he was driving in an erratic manner. Defendant could not produce a driver's license, but did produce the automobile's registration showing the automobile registered to a certain female. The officer arrested defendant for drunken driving. A Breathalyzer test indicated no alcohol in his blood and the charge was changed to driving under the influence of narcotics. The officer requested that the registered owner and her daughter consent to a search of the automobile, which they did. The detective found a gray metal box, which the women said was not theirs. Inside the box was a large quantity of tablets and pills. Lab tests showed some of them to be controlled substances and they were introduced in evidence at trial. Defendant was convicted and he appealed. Neither the registered owner nor her daughter had any interest in the box. The prosecution's case was premised on defendant's exclusive control of the box. The court held that consent obtained from someone who did not possess common authority over or other sufficient relationship to the effects sought to be inspected could not validate a warrantless search.</SPAN></P>

The trial court determined that the fees was a tax and unconstitutional.

To determine there had been a serious impairment of body function, however, required not only impairment was found but also that it was assigned a value.

The trial court granted summary judgment to plaintiffs, and defendants appealed, asserting that the trial court erred in ruling that plaintiffs had standing to challenge the recruitment decisions of the commission. The court agreed and reversed, explaining that neither plaintiff had standing. The union had shown no special injury as none of the current members had been injured by the questioned regulations, and there had been no injury to the union as bargaining agent for its members. As regards the standing of the president as a private resident, the court noted the Michigan rule that private persons could not redress grievances on behalf of the public. Only in cases where individual grievances were distinct from other members of the public could a private citizen proceed to judicial relief. Plaintiff had not alleged that he would sustain substantial injury or suffer loss or damage, as a taxpayer through increased taxation by the waiver of the residency requirement.</SPAN></P>

The entertainment corporation was held in contempt of court after the temporary restraining order and a subsequent preliminary injunction were issued. The Michigan Supreme Court subsequently held that the Act was not applicable to movie theaters. On appeal from the decisions finding the entertainment corporation in contempt, the court affirmed the rulings, finding that the entertainment corporation impermissibly attempted to collaterally attack the breadth and vagueness of the injunctions. The injunctions, even though improvidently granted, had to be obeyed until they were judicially vacated, unless the circuit court lacked jurisdiction. The court concluded that the circuit court clearly had subject matter jurisdiction over the actions for injunctive relief brought to obtain compliance with the Act. The circuit court's jurisdiction over the matter was not effected by the fact that the entertainment corporation was not entitled to the relief sought.</SPAN></P>

Finding that the trial judge's conclusory statements did not contain enough findings of fact as required by the EPA, the court remanded the action. The trial judge's ruling stated that while it was not specifically raised, the EPA was under consideration during the trial and in the findings of the court. The court held that it was difficult to determine whether the trial judge denied the motion because it was untimely or because the judge had already taken into account the requirements of the EPA. The court held that the trial judge was required to specify those factual findings upon which he actually relied in determining the propriety of injunctive relief. The trial judge' factual findings related principally to the feasibility of residential construction on plaintiffs' property.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with a minor traffic offense. Defendant asserted his right to a bench trial. Defendant was found guilty and was sentenced.

Defendant contended that his sentence was invalid to the extent that it exceeded the fine that would have been assessed upon a guilty plea. The circuit court affirmed the sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that it was constitutionally permissible that defendant would have obtained a benefit had he pled guilty and given up his constitutional right to trial. The situation was closely analogous to plea-bargaining. The penalty imposed was well within statutory limits. The practice of setting a lower limit on those who pled guilty to minor traffic offenses represented a service and benefit to defendant and others similarly situated and to the public generally.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Oakland County Circuit Court (Michigan), which convicted him upon the jury verdict for delivery of heroin in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect;&sect; 335.341(1)(a), 335.314(b). Defendant was sentenced to a prison term of not less than five nor more than 20 years. The prosecution's theory was that defendant had aided and abetted his co-defendant in the commission of the crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended that his arrest was invalid because it was based on information the arresting officers had acquired while using a transmitting device to monitor defendant's conversation with an undercover agent, and that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction because mere presence was insufficient to establish aiding and abetting. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held (1) that it did not consider defendant's first assignment of error because a review of the record indicated that defendant did not challenge the validity of his arrest by either a pretrial motion or an objection at trial; and (2) that there was sufficient evidence in support of defendant's conviction because the trial testimony of the undercover agent established that defendant was not a mere bystander, but was instead an active participant in the crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant employers appealed from the orders of the Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board (Michigan) in plaintiff employees' cases dismissing their appeals from adverse decisions of hearing referees for their failure to comply with 1975 Mich. Pub. Act 34 (Act), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.862 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.237(862)). The consolidated appeals challenged the act's constitutionality and the appeal board's authority to enforce it by dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees were awarded workmen's compensation benefits. The employers sought review by the appeal board. The employees moved to dismiss because the employers failed to comply with the Act. The employers asserted that the Act was unconstitutional. The appeal board notified the employers that failure to comply might result in dismissal of their appeals but they failed to comply and their appeals were dismissed. The employers raised questions of substantive and procedural due process and equal protection. It was suggested that the Act discriminated among a common class of litigants, namely workmen's compensation appellants, and did not apply to injuries occurring before its effective date. The court found the employers' claims of prejudice were groundless and affirmed. A referee had determined that the disabled employees were entitled to benefits. They needed the money immediately. The employers were not deprived of property without due process. The Act did not interfere with the obligation of contracts. The dismissal power of the appeal board for noncompliance with the Act was implied.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs brought suit, and the trial court granted summary judgment for defendant. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded with directions to the trial court to enter judgment for plaintiffs. Section 500.3109(1) was unconstitutional because it was patently unreasonable and discriminatory. It allowed no-fault recovery to be reduced by governmental collateral sources, such as workmen's compensation or social security benefits, but not by private insurance sources. Thus, &sect; 500.3109(1) discriminated against persons who did not have or could not afford private insurance.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed, holding, as a matter of law, that the child was not employed by either the newspaper company or the substitute newsboy under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 418.161(1)(b). The court declined to award compensation to a person whose existence was not known to the newspaper company or any of its employees because the legislature never intended such a result.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The zoning ordinance in question provided that mobile homes were considered dwelling units and were not permitted as an accessory use to a permitted principal use and were only permitted in approved mobile home parks. The issue on appeal was whether the township zoning ordinance was unconstitutional as it applied to the landowners' use of their property for a mobile home. The court noted that no mobile home park existed in the township. The township had approved a proposed mobile home park but no work on the proposed park had begun. The use of land for mobile homes was neither imminent nor a factual certainty. The court held that as a matter of law having a mobile home on land was a legitimate. It was neither a nuisance per se nor detrimental to public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. Therefore, from the face of the ordinance and from the facts evident in the record the court concluded that it appeared that a legitimate use had been excluded from the entire township. The township failed to meet its burden of justifying the ordinance and the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to the landowners' property.</SPAN></P>

The similar act evidence did not patently violate defendants' constitutional right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, any more than did any other relevant, material, and competent evidence, nor did it violate the due process requirement that defendants be fully informed of the charges that they were compelled to defend because it was admitted as proof of intent, motive, or scheme. The similar act evidence was more probative than prejudicial. The prosecution's endorsement of all the necessary witnesses to the similar act permitted defendants to prepare for trial and provide defense counsel with the necessary rebuttal evidence.

Ann. &sect; 15.3492, was unconstitutional, in an action brought by plaintiff board member after he was removed from the board when he relocated to property outside of the school district and a new board member was appointed to replace him.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted judgment on the pleadings to the board, and the member attempted to proceed quo warranto to the court. The court treated the case as an appeal and remanded it to the trial court. The trial court held rule was unconstitutional but did not issue an injunction because other appropriate relief was available. On second appeal, the court affirmed as to the unconstitutionality of the rule and remanded with direction that a quo warranto judgment be entered by the trial court. The court ruled that &sect; 492 was unconstitutional because the member's freeholder status was irrelevant to his capabilities as a board member and was violative of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV.

Laws Ann. &sect; 800.283. A trial judge (Michigan) granted defendant's motion to quash the information, holding that a 1972 amendment to the statute was unconstitutional because the subject matter contained in the amendment was not evidenced in the title of the act and the amendment was vague and overbroad. The people appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1909, the Michigan Legislature enacted Public Act 17, designed to keep weapons, liquor, and narcotics out of convicts' hands to forestall a convict from escaping and to keep weapons out of convicts' hands which might be used to injure another convict or person. The questions on appeal were whether the 1972 amendment to 1909 PA 17, &sect; 3, had to be declared unconstitutional. Defendant claimed that the amendment was vague and overbroad and the act now embraced an object not expressed in its title in violation of Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 24 (1963). The court unanimously determined that the amendment was not vague and overbroad. The court held that the act's title need not serve as an index of all that the act contained. The amendment comported to the guidelines that the amendment was germane, auxiliary, or incidental to the general purpose as set forth in the title.</SPAN></P>

The pedestrian and plaintiff, his wife, brought suit against these defendants for negligence and against defendant tavern for selling alcohol to the driver. The trial court (Michigan) granted the tavern's motion for accelerated judgment after the driver and her husband settled with plaintiffs. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver and her husband had a settlement and indemnity agreement with plaintiffs. The issue was whether the &quot;name and retain&quot; amendment to the dram shop act precluded further claim against the tavern. Plaintiffs argued that they complied with the statute by naming the driver and her husband when they commenced suit and that their hold harmless agreement expressly retained them in the litigation. The court held that plaintiffs complied with the statute. However, the tavern argued that the purpose of the amendment was to require the intoxicated defendant to remain an active party in the litigation and to have a continuing monetary interest in the outcome. The court held that the statute was not intended to prohibit settlement between a plaintiff and his intoxicated tortfeasor. The language of the statute indicated only an intention to require the intoxicated tortfeasor to be retained as a defendant. The statute only required a plaintiff to retain the tortfeasor in the lawsuit. The effect of the trial court's ruling was to prohibit settlement, which went beyond the statute's purpose and language.</SPAN></P>

The lower court had ordered the temporary detention of defendant for the purpose of obtaining a blood and hair sample. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the samples on the basis that the evidence was the product of an unreasonable search and seizure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charge with murdering his father and several other people in the home with his father. The State obtained an order to gather defendant's hair and blood samples to see if they matched samples found at the scene. The request for the order was accompanied by an affidavit which stated specifically the reasons why the samples were being asked of defendant, including that his hair type matched that found at the scene, he was left handed as was the killer, he had access to the house, and had no alibi. The court held that the court-ordered search was valid. The court held that intrusions into the human body were on an equal plane with searches of dwellings, and concluded that a search warrant was required to make the samples admissible. The court held that the dentition order was the equivalent of a search warrant, and that it did not matter what name was given to the instrument, so long as it met the requirements, which the detention order did. The court finally held that the supporting affidavit asserted facts sufficient to constitute probable cause did exist to support the &quot;warrant.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that the department director maliciously published false statements to prospective employers in evaluations of the nurse's work performance. The nurse and her husband contended on appeal that the governmental immunity statute was unconstitutional, and that the department director was not immune from suit. The city and department director argued governmental and qualified immunity respectively. The court noted that the nurse and her husband had failed to cite precedent for the proposition that the First Amendment protected the right of a citizen to sue the government for damages caused by tortious conduct of governmental employees. The court noted that the duty which the department director was alleged to have violated was a private, common-law duty rather than a duty imposed upon her in her official capacity, so that governmental immunity alone would not bar the action against her. The court noted that malice negated qualified privilege, and held that whether the nurse and husband were required to allege specific facts from which malice could be inferred, or whether a general allegation was sufficient, the complaint adequately stated a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees received a $ 235,000 verdict, and the trial court awarded appellees $ 45,118 interest, computed from the date of the complaint to the date of payment. Appellant's policy provided for a maximum liability of $ 250,000. Appellant sought review, contending that appellant was responsible for prejudgment interest in the amount of $ 15,000, which was the difference between the verdict and the policy limit. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the action. The court held that by statute and on public policy grounds, appellant was required to pay prejudgment interest, even though prejudgment interest did not fall within the policy provisions covering interest, costs, or damages. However, the court further held that appellant was liable only to the extent that the amount of prejudgment interest did not exceed the policy limits. The court noted that the effect of allowing prejudgment interest in an amount beyond the policy limits would be to force an insurer to acquiesce to a plaintiff's demand at an early stage of the proceedings where the insurer might have a meritorious defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The representative filed suit against the employer's workmen's compensation insurer alleging that the insurer was responsible for the employee's death in an industrial accident because of negligent inspection of the employer's premises. The trial court granted the insurer's motion for summary judgment based on &sect; 418.827(8). The representative appealed, asserting that the &sect; 418.27(8) was an unconstitutional violation of equal protection as it prohibited actions against compensation carriers while allowing actions against other third party tortfeasors. The representative also claimed that &sect; 418.827(8) violated public policy. The court affirmed the trial court decision. The court held that &sect; 418.827(8) did not constitute a denial of equal protection and that a rational basis for the classification could be readily hypothesized in that the Legislature granted immunity to the compensation carriers in order to encourage safety inspections. The court deferred to the Legislature's determination that &sect; 418.827(8) was in the interests of public policy, and held that &sect; 418.827(8) was clearly within the expressed purpose of the Worker's Compensation Act, Mich.

The court had reversed the trial court's order of summary judgment in favor of the city and held Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 46.175b to be unconstitutional. Plaintiff property owner had filed the action claiming violation of his right to due process of law under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mich.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner was a resident of a neighboring town and failed to receive notice of an ad valorem tax that was published in the local newspaper where his property was located. The notice was published in compliance with Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 46.175b. Previously, the court held that &sect; 46.175b was unconstitutional. On motion by the city, the court reconsidered whether notice by publication as provided by &sect; 46.175b was sufficient to satisfy the constitutional requirement of due process of law. The court reversed its earlier judgment. The court held that the kind of notice required depended on the circumstances of the case and the availability of other means in both a theoretical and economic sense. Notices of the bond issues were published in the local newspaper. Both notices had headlines in large bold type: &quot;CITY OF SWARTZ CREEK RESOLUTION.&quot; Both notices set forth the entire resolution, the contract involved, the city's obligation and the right to petition for referendum. The notices were approximately eight inches by nine inches and were printed in adequate type. The court held that the notices were calculated to give reasonable notice to the taxpayers involved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The libeled filed a claim against the newspaper charging that newspaper had repeated a libelous editorial that claimed libeled had inadequately represented an indigent criminal defendant.

The trial court denied libeled's motion to dismiss newspaper's counterclaim, and denied the motion to compel newspaper to answer the interrogatories concerning newspaper's financial situation. On appeal, the court reversed in part and affirmed in part. The court held that the trial court had erred in not granting libeled's motion for summary judgment. However, the trial court erred in not granting the libeled's motion for summary judgment as to the newspaper's claim for abuse of process. The court further held that because punitive damages were not intended to punish newspaper for its actions, evidence of newspaper's financial situation was immaterial, and punitive damages award was proper. Finally, the court concluded that the denial of libeled's motion to compel newspaper to answer the interrogatories pertaining to its financial situation was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that the trial court erred in denying their motion for summary judgment based upon an alleged failure of the township to file a resolution as required by Mich.

Additionally, the motion was not preserved for review. Plaintiffs also argued that the township's zoning ordinances were unconstitutional because they permitted the township to use an office building on plaintiffs' property but did not permit the purchaser to do so. The court found that township was immune from zoning regulations when serving a governmental, rather than ministerial, purpose and where it specifically exempted itself. A distinction in the township's ordinances between governmental and private business use of otherwise residentially zoned property was reasonably based upon relevant factors and, thus, was not an equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

In denying plaintiffs' requests for relief, the court held that while plaintiffs had standing to file their action, the challenged statute,&nbsp;&sect; 431.43(5), did not create a classification that was arbitrary and unreasonable. The legislation was not invalid simply because it affected only one locality within the state, nor did the scheme of fund distribution upset equal protection standards.

A week later, the complainant identified defendant by selecting his photograph after reviewing 50 to 60 photographs. At trial, defendant raised an alibi defense in conjunction with a theory of mistaken identity. A friend of defendant relayed that she had recently mistaken defendant for another individual. The description of the individual paralleled the complainant's description given to police. Defendant was convicted of assault with intent to commit rape and gross indecency between a male and female. The court affirmed on appeal, holding that the photographic identification procedure was not impermissibly suggestive. Police did not draw attention to defendant's picture. Also, defendant failed to preserve error relating to alleged improprieties committed by the prosecutor because he did not object, ask for a corrective instruction, or seek a mistrial.

The court held that the employer's failure to report the injury invoked the sanction of tolling the statute of limitations under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.381(1). The court refused to impose an additional sanction of precluding the employer from asserting the two-year-back limitation. The court reversed and held that Mich. Comp.
