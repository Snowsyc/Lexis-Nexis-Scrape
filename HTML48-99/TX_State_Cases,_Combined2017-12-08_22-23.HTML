</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a decision of the 180th District Court, Harris County (Texas), which convicted appellant of the offense of attempted murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for attempted murder. The court found that appellant's motion to dismiss under the Speedy Trial Act was moot because the Act was held unconstitutional. The court found that in the absence of proof to the contrary, it was presumed that a jury followed the instructions given by the judge and appellant did not demonstrate that the jury failed to follow the instructions. The court found that appellant and her ex-husband were divorced at the time of trial. Thus, the ex-husband was fully competent to testify as to the events surrounding the alleged offense. The court found that the same evidence was elicited by appellant during cross-examination of the ex-husband as well as the complainant, and appellant was not in a position to complain on appeal. Thus, the court affirmed appellant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for attempted murder was affirmed. Appellant did not demonstrate that the jury failed to follow the instructions given by the judge. Appellant and her ex-husband were divorced at the time of trial, thus the absolute prohibition against adverse spousal testimony was no longer applicable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded nolo contendere to a charge of selling obscene materials and was sentenced to four days confinement in the county jail and a fine of $ 700. Defendant appealed the judgment, arguing that the trial court erred in denying her pretrial motion to quash, arguing that the Texas Obscenity Statute violated U.S. Const. amend. I and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court held that defendant failed to state the portions of the statute that she believed to be unconstitutionally vague, either in itself or in the instant case, nor did defendant detail a risk or detriment to which she was exposed without fair warning. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that because defendant failed to enumerate a single example of unconstitutional application, the presumption of the statute's constitutionality remained unrebutted. The court held that Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 43.21(a)(1) (1988), which defined obscenity, was constitutional because it adopted the three-pronged approach and did not require a jury to determine a work's literary, artistic, political, and scientific value by the community's standards as perceived by an average person.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant chief executive officer, through agents and literature, represented to the complaining witnesses that their investments would make a profit. In 1983, the interest payments ceased, the company went bankrupt, and the investors lost their principle. Appellant was convicted and sentenced to ten years confinement for the felony offense of theft of property, namely money in excess of $ 10,000. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court properly admitted exhibits of appellant's financial records, because his objections to the chain of custody went to the weight of the evidence. The indictment, although it did not define &quot;deprive,&quot; gave adequate notice of the offense. The court held that the intent to unlawfully deprive was established by sufficient evidence that appellant grossly misled investors into a false sense of security when the investments did not exist or were not used as represented. The court held that, given the curative instruction and devastating consequences for owners who lost their life savings, the punishment was reasonable and not the product of unfair bias resulting from the unconstitutional parole instruction laws.</SPAN></P>

When the officer discovered that appellant had outstanding warrants, appellant was arrested and a search revealed heroin. Appellant was convicted of possession of heroin. Appellant sought review, contending that the jury instructions required that the heroin be admitted into evidence, a discrepancy in the chain of custody caused reasonable doubt, and the record failed to show that appellant knew the substance was heroin. Appellant also contended that there was no probable cause for the arrest, the jury was erroneously instructed under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4, and the trial court erred by including in the judgment the date the offense was committed. The court affirmed and held that the jury instructions did not require that heroin be admitted into evidence, the chain of custody was sufficiently established, and the amount of heroin in appellant's possession was enough to prove knowledge. In addition, the court held that there was sufficient probable cause, the search was incident to a lawful custodial arrest, the jury instruction was harmless error, and the inclusion of the date of the offense was not error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter. The trial court gave only the statutory parole instruction in the jury charge at the conclusion of the punishment phase. In light of new rulings that held the statutory parole instruction to be unconstitutional, the Court of Criminal Appeals remanded the cause. It directed the court to reconsider the harm caused appellant by the inclusion of the parole instruction despite of the fact that appellant made no specific and timely objection as to the unconstitutionality of the charge at trial. The court applied the standard of review in Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2). The court reversed and held it could not determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury did not consider the unconstitutional parole charge in deciding to assess a punishment against appellant that was in excess of the minimum allowed by law. The court was required to reverse the case and remand it to the trial court for a new trial on punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of operating an adult arcade without a permit in violation of Houston, Tex., Ordinance 85-1337. Appellant alleged that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad on its face and as applied, violated due process of law and constituted an impermissible prior restraint on free speech, and was void under the Texas Constitution and under the doctrine of preemption because of its inconsistency with state legislation which provided for the regulation, taxation, and zoning of coin-operated machines and regulated the location of sexually oriented commercial activities. On appeal, the court affirmed appellant's conviction. The court held that the ordinance was not vague because it provided standards that were capable of objective measurement and gave fair notice of the conduct required and prohibited. The court found that the ordinance was not overbroad. The court ruled that the ordinance merely regulated the manner in which an adult arcade may operate and did not offend the U. S. Const. amend. I. Finally, the court determined that there was no conflict between the ordinance and the state legislation therefore the ordinance was not void or preempted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant worked at her husband's auto accessory store and bought used car seats for resale but failed to obtain a warranty of good title from the individual. The car seats later proved to be stolen and appellant was convicted of misdemeanor theft by receiving stolen property. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and held that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03(c)(3) provided fair notice of the requirements and was not unconstitutionally vague. The court held that under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 2.05(2)(B), the jury was permitted to presume that appellant knew the car seats were stolen if she failed to do any of the three acts required of her under &sect; 31.03(c)(3), and that, therefore, the presumption was not unconstitutionally irrational and arbitrary. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to support appellant's conviction because the properly qualified expert testified that the fair market value of the car seats was actually higher than the amount for which she was charged. Because the state filed no controverting affidavit, appellant was entitled to a per se change of venue but waived that right by not objecting and pursuing fact issues at the venue hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled 36 of appellant's 37 points of error on appeal. Appellant's crime was a serious one, and the jury could easily have found that appellant repeatedly committed drug offenses throughout the course of organized criminal activity. There were sufficient facts in an affidavit for the warrant issuing magistrate to find probable cause that appellant was committing felony offenses and that an interception of his phone calls would provide evidence of such crimes. The state showed that appellant was organizing the transfer of hundreds of pounds of marihuana. From appellant's residence, appellant would arrange the transfer of marihuana he had purchased to persons in Florida, Houston, and Austin. Numerous individuals were involved in appellant's network. The court agreed with appellant's last point of error that he suffered egregious harm because in his final argument, the prosecutor referred to the parole charge and explained how parole eligibility was determined, which was unconstitutional. Because the court was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the parole charge made no contribution to the punishment, it vacated the judgment and remanded for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a jury trial, appellees illegitimate daughters were found the sole heirs of intestate decedent. Appellant heirs sought review of the judgment, claiming that the trial court erred in retroactively applying an amendment to Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 42(b).

The court affirmed the judgment, holding that no litigant had a vested right in a statute which affected remedy or was procedural in nature and affected no vested substantive right. Further, the court held that the interest in finality was not affected by application of the amendment prior to distribution of the estate, and the application of the statute as it existed on the date of death would have deprived appellees equal treatment under the law, under U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a plea of not guilty to the charge of possession of cocaine, defendant was placed on deferred adjudication. The trial judge warned defendant that it would impose a 75-year sentence if defendant's probation was revoked. Defendant made no objections to the trial court's comment. Later, the state initiated an adjudication of guilt and proceedings to revoke defendant's probation when he violated his probation terms. Various witnesses testified on defendant's behalf during the revocation hearing. At sentencing, the trial court referenced its previous warning to defendant and imposed a 75-year sentence as the trial court had threatened to impose if defendant's probation was revoked. Defendant made no objections to the sentencing. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held the trial judge's comments when granting deferred adjudication and when assessing punishment indicated that he had impermissibly determined defendant's sentence prior to considering defendant's presentation of mitigating evidence; but because defendant failed to object to the punishment or to the procedures used by the trial court, any due process violation was waived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment of the 10th Judicial District Court of Galveston County, Texas, which convicted appellant of injury to a child by omission and sentenced him to 60 years in prison after he abused and killed his girlfriend's two-year-old son.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was left to care for his girlfriend's two-year-old son while she worked, and was later convicted of injury to a child by omission after the child died from abusive injuries. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and held that appellant could have been found guilty under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.04 (Supp. 1988) without proof that he had a duty toward the child because omission was an element of that offense and Tex. Penal Code &sect; 6.01(c) (1974) required a duty be found only where omission was not an element. The court found that &sect; 22.04 was not impermissibly vague as applied to appellant because his U.S. Const. amend. I rights were not at issue and appellant's conduct was the type of hard-core conduct which would have been prohibited under any construction of the statute. The court also held that appellant was a person of ordinary intelligence who had fair notice that his failure to provide medical care to the victim under the circumstances subjected him to criminal liability under &sect; 22.04.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment of the 12th Judicial District Court of Walker County, Texas, which convicted him of murder pursuant to a jury verdict and sentenced him to 99 years in prison, after appellant stabbed another inmate 51 times in order to carry out a prison gang contract hit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant stabbed another inmate 51 times pursuant to a prison gang contract hit and was found guilty of murder. Both appellant and his attorney filed briefs on appeal, but the court held that there was no right of hybrid representation in Texas and that it was not required to consider appellant's pro se brief. On appeal, the court affirmed appellant's conviction and held that appellant's confession was properly admitted because the prison guard's question about the whereabouts of the murder weapon was not reasonably calculated to elicit appellant's response of &quot;I killed him&quot; as prohibited by Miranda. The court also held that if the guard's query was custodial interrogation which required Miranda warnings, it came under the public safety exception to the rule. The court found that appellant failed to properly support his motion for change of venue with two credible persons' affidavits and that his motions to quash the indictment were properly denied. Display of appellant's tattoo did not violate the right against self-incrimination and the trial court had discretion to determine whether leg irons were appropriate for restraining appellant's witnesses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant 's conviction for murder was affirmed because his confession was properly admitted as the query of the prison guard to ascertain the whereabouts of the murder weapon could not have been reasonably calculated to elicit appellant's actual response.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found appellant guilty of aggravated assault. The court of criminal appeals reversed and vacated the court's judgment that affirmed appellant's conviction. The court of criminal appeals remanded to the court for a determination on whether the trial court's error in admitting the evidence of the videotape of the child's testimony contributed beyond a reasonable doubt to appellant's conviction. On remand, the court held the trial court did err in admitting the videotape because it violated appellant's right to confrontation when the child was never produced in court for cross-examination. Next, the court held that the error required reversal because the court was not able to say beyond a reasonable doubt that the videotape made no contribution to appellant's conviction. The court after viewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict found the evidence sufficient for establishing the elements of aggravated sexual assault. The court reversed appellant's conviction because the trial court erred in admitting the videotape, and the error contributed to appellant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

A motion for severance was denied and defendants were found guilty after a jury trial. Defendants appealed. The court held that the girls' testimony that they paid for drugs by having sex with one defendant was relevant as proof that the conspiracy to deliver had been carried out, and was direct evidence of an act by one co-conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy. The court found that the testimony was not prejudicial and inflammatory, was properly admitted as evidence of the guilt of both defendants, was not a basis to grant a motion for severance, and the joint trial did not result in prejudice to either. The court found that there was no error in refusing an instruction as to photographs withdrawn that were otherwise admissible. The court affirmed the judgments of conviction and held that considering the nature of the offenses, the facts proven, including the overwhelming evidence of guilt, the jury instructions did not contribute to the punishments assessed, were not harmful, and defendants were not denied a fair and impartial trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the aggravated sexual assault of his minor daughter, which he appealed, claiming that the trial court erred in admitting his older daughter's testimony as to the minor daughter's account of the assault, pursuant to Tex.

On appeal, the court held that the testimony qualified under a form of child-victim hearsay exception set out in art. 38.702 and under the circumstances was constitutional because the minor daughter spontaneously told her older sister of the assault, the child was not presented in court through visual electronic medium, and the state called the child in the case-in-chief to verify her statements and to allow cross-examination. The court found that the lower court satisfied the requirement of testing the statement's reliability and that the facts of the case supported the lower court's findings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted appellant of aggravated robbery. Appellant argued that insufficient evidence supported his conviction because the only witness who identified appellant was an accomplice witness whose testimony was not sufficiently corroborated.

The court held that a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant committed the offense. Next, the court held that appellant's objection to a police officer's hearsay testimony was not preserved for review because appellant did not offer any reason for not objecting before the answer was given. The court held that the jury instruction concerning parole eligibility pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

Appellant claimed that his counsel was not acquainted with the law concerning impeachment and cross-examination of defense witnesses and was not prepared to preserve the defense strategy from improper assault by the prosecutor. Appellant also claimed that the lower court erred by submitting to the jury, at the punishment phase, the parole instructions set out in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a), which violated the separation of powers doctrine and denied him due process of law. On appeal, the court held that appellant's counsel's performance was not deficient as counsel timely objected to prosecutor assaults during defense witness questioning and any harm caused was corrected by instructions to disregard. The court held that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 was ruled unconstitutional but the lower court's jury instructions to ignore matters concerning parole was a harmless error as it was a curative instruction to the jury did not affect appellant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court overruled appellant's points of errors and affirmed his conviction. It overruled appellant's claim that the obscenity statute,&nbsp;Tex. Penal Code &sect; 43.21 (1985), was unconstitutionally vague because appellant failed to specify the statutory language he alleged to be indefinite, vague, and uncertain, and failed to allege any deficiency of the particular statute. The court also held that it did not have jurisdiction to address his argument that a pre-arrest judicial determination of obscenity was required because appellant did not address that issue in his motion to quash. The court did address his challenge that the statute contravened U.S. Const. amend. I and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court found that the statute tracked the test for obscenity and did not inject considerations of community standards into the separate determination of the work's value and therefore passed constitutional muster.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the 182nd District Court, Harris County (Texas), which convicted defendant of aggravated sexual assault of his 13-year old step-granddaughter. He contended that the trial court erred in allowing a district court judge to testify as a character witness, and by including, over defendant's objection, the parole charge required under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault of his 13-year old step-granddaughter. Defendant appealed his conviction, claiming that the trial court erred in permitting a district court judge to testify as a character witness, and that the trial court erred by including, over defendant's objection, the parole charge required under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a). The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. While Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 605 prevented a judge from testifying at a trial over which he presided, a judge was not prohibited from serving as a witness in all cases solely because of his position. The probative value of the testifying judge's testimony was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. The testifying judge's interaction with the parties was personal and in no way connected with his duties as a criminal judge. The court also found that the trial court's inclusion of the parole charge mandated by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a) was error, but not reversible, because it also found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the submission of the parole charge made no contribution to defendant's punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's sexual assault conviction. It was not error for the trial court to permit a district court judge to testify where his interaction with the parties was of a personal nature and not connected to his position as a judge. Further, the trial court's error in giving a parole charge to the jury was not reversible because the submission of the parole charge did not contribute to defendant's punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant debtor challenged his conviction from the 21st District Court, Washington County (Texas), for the felony of hindering a secured creditor. Appellant had granted the bank a security interest in seven vehicles, items of office furniture, and his company's accounts receivable and failed to deliver any of the collateral items to the bank after it sued and recovered a summary judgment authorizing it to levy execution on its collateral.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant debtor based his objections to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the charge of hindering a secured creditor on both the transferring and the disposing theories. The court held that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have concluded, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant disposed of the collateral to which the bank was entitled by appropriating or exercising control over it. The court concluded that the statute sufficiently specified the requisite mental state and that failure to define terms would not categorically render a statute unconstitutionally vague. The court also held that the statute gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of the conduct it proscribed and was not unconstitutionally vague or uncertain. The court found that the trial court properly included two definitions in its charge, consistent with the alternate theories of committing the offense as alleged: disposal or transfer. The court concluded that the evidence developed during trial sufficiently raised the defensive issue of whether appellant acted alone or as a representative of his business, to justify the law of parties charge. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of aggravated assault and sentenced him to six years imprisonment. The trial court charged the jury in accordance with the parole law provisions of Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

At the evidentiary hearing on defendant's motion for a new trial, defendant introduced an affidavit of one of the jurors, which indicated that the jury disobeyed the instruction and fashioned defendant's sentence based on the parole law. The trial court overruled defendant's motion for a new trial. The court applied the harm test set forth in Tex R. App. P. Ann. 81(b)(2) (1988), which required an appellate court to reverse a judgment where the record showed error below, unless the court determined beyond a reasonable doubt that the error made no contribution to the punishment. In reversing the judgment and remanding the matter, the court held that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for a new trial where uncontroverted evidence established that the jury violated the court's instruction not to consider the parole law.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the facts of the case included, among other things, appellant's written confession as the heinous murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with driving while intoxicated under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701L-1(2)(A)(B) (Supp. 1988). The lower court convicted appellant, sentencing him to two years probation, 30 days confinement, and payment of a fine. Appellant challenged his conviction, contending that the lower court erred in admitting the results of his blood-alcohol tests and evidence that an alcohol concentration of 0.10 was statutory proof of intoxication. Moreover, appellant was unfairly limited as to juror challenges. The court affirmed appellant's conviction, holding that the complained of errors did not contribute to appellant's conviction. The blood-alcohol evidence was a theory of intoxication which was alleged in the information. Witness testimony as to intoxication was proper, and there was no mandatory presumption given to the jury as to intoxication. Moreover, appellant failed to show that an objectionable venireman served on the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment from the 182nd District Court, Harris County (Texas), convicting him of armed robbery. Appellant claimed the trial court erred by instructing the jury on a parole charge under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07 (1988), which was declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge provided a jury instruction which included an unconstitutional parole charge under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07 (1988) at appellant's trial for aggravated robbery. Appellant did not object. The court affirmed the conviction and held that appellant's failure to object waived the error. This prohibited appellant from obtaining a windfall because appellant may have guessed that appellant would have received a lesser sentence had the jury been aware of the time appellant would have served. However, had the appellant objected to the instruction, the court would have reversed the conviction absent proof that the jury was not prejudiced by the instruction and appellee would have had the burden to show that there was no prejudice so as to avoid inconsistent results and to provide an objective test to determine if a conviction should have been reversed. The court found that the state should have the burden to show that there was no prejudice because of the difficulty of determining whether the jury was improperly prejudiced by the instruction because Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 606(b) prohibited a juror from testifying as to statements made during deliberations..</SPAN></P>

The lower court affirmed appellant's conviction and, on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that Houston, Tex., Ordinance 85-1337 was not void under Tex. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5 because the ordinance did not invade the state law-making function because it had a different purpose than Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. arts. 8814 and 8817 (Vernon 1964). The ordinance was to discourage adult arcades as places of sexual encounter or solicitation and arts. 8814 and 8817 were to provide comprehensive regulation of music and skill or pleasure coin-operated machines. The court held that Houston, Tex., Ordinance 28.849(b) was not in conflict with Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried and convicted of burglary of a motor vehicle. At sentencing, the jury found two enhancement paragraphs to be true. Defendant asserted on appeal that the punishment charge required reversal because it required a minimum sentence of 25 years due to the enhancement paragraphs. The court affirmed the conviction. Although the charge was mandatory and constitutional, defendant did not object, so the issue was not preserved for review. Defendant also complained that the trial court gave an unconstitutional jury charge regarding the consideration of parole. Since the instruction made no contribution to the punishment, the court overruled that point of error. Defendant also argued that the trial judge did not have jurisdiction, as he was assigned to the case contrary to Tex. Gov't Code Ann &sect; 74.061.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder of a peace officer after alleging that he had an insane delusion that police were ambushing him. The trial court denied admission of a learned treatise on insanity, refused an instruction on self-defense based on delusion, and permitted an instruction on parole laws. The court affirmed the conviction because there was no prejudicial error by the trial court. The court found that the learned treatise was not introduced in conjunction with expert testimony and thus was inadmissible under Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 803(18). The court further found that Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 46.03 &sect; 1(e) (1988) was constitutional because statutes prescribing the disposition of guilt by reason of insanity were the province of the court and not the jury, and thus the jury was prohibited from instruction. The self-defense instruction was correctly disallowed because the circumstances as perceived by defendant did not constitute a defense for the use of deadly force, under Tex.

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, holding that defendant failed to cite to any specific language contained in &sect; 43.21 which was indefinite, vague, or uncertain, and &sect; 43.21 had been held to be otherwise constitutional, therefore the court would not engage in a search for unconstitutionality. The court also rejected defendant's allegation that the trial court erred in denying her pretrial motion to quash the indictment based on the fact that there was no timely and proper determination of obscenity because the court had previously rejected that contention in another opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed their convictions for misdemeanor criminal trespass by the County Criminal Court at Law No. 5, Harris County (Texas) on the ground the informations did not allege offenses. Defendants contended that they were denied their defenses of necessity and defense of a third person, that evidence relevant to those defenses was improperly excluded, that the state's argument was prejudicial, and that probation conditions were improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of misdemeanor criminal trespass under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 30.05 for their activities at an abortion clinic. The court affirmed and held that the indictment alleged the essential elements and gave proper notice under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 21.17 (1966). The court held that defendants were not deprived of a fair trial or due process because they could not meet all the elements of the claimed defense of necessity under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 9.22, or the defense of a third person under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 9.33, or establish relevance for the excluded evidence on abortion because the unborn were not persons for purposes of U.S. Const. amend. XIV protection. The court found that the prosecutor properly used a chart to summarize evidence and that his improper remark about defense counsel was not harmful to defendants. The court upheld the denial of a defendant's motion for an instructed verdict because the defendant waived any error by putting on a defense after the state rested. The court modified the probation order because the limitation on defendants' right to picket and demonstrate was outside the scope of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 42.12.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a plea bargain, appellant pled guilty and was convicted of solicitation to commit capital murder. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and found that the trial court did not err when it overruled appellant's motion to quash the indictment because the grand jury did not prepare a memorandum pursuant to Tex. Code. Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 20.19 (1977). The court determined that art. 20.19 was directory rather than mandatory. The court also rejected appellant's interpretation of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.15 (1977), which appellant contended on three points of error was unconstitutional. The court found that art. 1.15 was constitutional and did not prohibit appellant from presenting evidence at the punishment hearing. The court further found that appellant was not denied the right to a fair trial or the right to compulsory process because of art. 1.15.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court because the grand jury's failure to prepare a memorandum required by statute was not reversible error.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress oral statements that he made after his arrest under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.22 (1979). He also argued that the prosecutor's peremptory challenge of all black persons on the panel violated his equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court found no evidence that the state engaged in unconstitutional purposeful discrimination through its use of peremptory challenges. At the Batson hearing on defendant's motion, the trial court found that defendant raised an inference of discrimination on the part of the state. However, the trial court also found that the state provided racially neutral explanations for the strikes, and that defendant failed to carry his burden rebutting the state's explanations. The court found that defendant's statements to police, that he had not fired the pistol because there was a spent round under the hammer, indicated his familiarity with and control over the pistol and tended to establish his guilt. The statement was admissible under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.22 &sect; 3(c) (1979).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant airport employee filed an action for personal injuries against appellant airline and appellees, architectural firm, electrical subcontractor, and general contractors.

Thereafter, the trial court entered a judgment adverse to appellants upon the jury's verdict. Appellants sought review, arguing that the instruction constituted reversible error. The court agreed with appellants, reversed the decision, and remanded for a new trial. The court found a need for special instructions to the jury because of the confusing evidence Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect; 21.042(e), which was declared unconstitutional after the trial court proceeding. Further, the appraisal theory advanced by the state, condemned by a Texas Supreme Court decision, and encouraged by the unconstitutional statute, led to the inescapable conclusion that such appraisal resulted in offsetting the estimated enhanced value of the remainder after the condemnation against the market value of the part taken at the time of the condemnation. Accordingly, the jury answers suggested the same conclusion, which would have been cured by appellants' requested instruction.</SPAN></P>

The court explained that the indictment was not defective, because it failed to allege the manner of appellant's intoxication.

The court noted that obscene devises are not considered &quot;pure speech&quot; and noted that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.21 (Supp. 1988) had withstood numerous challenges on the same grounds.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction from the 228th District Court, Harris County (Texas), for delivery of more than 50 pounds and less than 200 pounds of marijuana, contending that there were errors in the jury charge and the prosecution's argument to the jury that deprived him of a fair trial and that he was denied effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found appellant guilty of delivery of more than 50 pounds and less than 200 pounds of marijuana, and assessed his punishment at 25 years confinement and a fine. Appellant complained that the prosecution's argument included references to the quantity and value of the marijuana, the low pay of the officers who testified, importance of the case to the county, the large numbers of &quot;dope dealers&quot; in the county, the problem of the availability of &quot;dope&quot; to school children, and the fact that the jury had already acquitted one &quot;dope dealer&quot; in this case, all of which was outside the record. The court concluded that there was a reasonable possibility that the improper argument contributed to the punishment assessed, and sustained this point of error. The court also sustained appellant's contention with regard to error in the jury instruction on parole law. The court overruled appellant's contention that trial counsel's representation was defective, finding no reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding at the guilt/innocence stage would have been different. The court affirmed on the issue of appellant's guilt, but reversed at the punishment stage.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court on the issue of appellant's guilt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After receiving a complaint concerning narcotics activities on the premises of a nightclub, agents of the Alcoholic Beverage Commission (Texas) obtained appellant's consent to search a filing cabinet where they discovered cocaine.

The court affirmed appellant's conviction, holding that the trial court properly overruled appellant's motion to suppress because appellant voluntarily consented to the search that resulted in the seizure. Further, the court upheld the constitutionality of the challenged statutes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, appellant contended that his conviction had been inappropriate because the trial court had erred in overruling appellant's special plea in bar based on collateral estoppel. The appellate court found that because the verdict of acquittal in the former prosecution for aggravated sexual assault could have been based on an issue other than entry, the issue of whether appellant entered the victim's home was properly relitigated. The appellate court accordingly held that collateral estoppel did not bar the instant prosecution and overruled that point of error. The appellate court then found that it was not error for the trial court to admit into evidence a two-page parole certificate and that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's affirmative finding that appellant used a deadly weapon during the commission of the burglary offense. The appellate court affirmed, concluding that the parole law charge given pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a) (Supp. 1988) did not constitute reversible error where it failed to make a contribution to the jury's assessment of sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a plea bargain, appellant pleaded nolo contendere to two charges of selling obscene materials in violation of the Texas Obscenity Statute, Texas Penal Code ch. 43, subch. B (1988). The court affirmed his convictions. It rejected appellant's claim that the statute violated U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV. Appellant failed to enumerate a specific example of how the statute operated against him, or in general, in an unconstitutional fashion. Further, Texas courts of appeal had found Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.21(a) to be constitutional. The court rejected appellant's contention that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions because the state failed to obtain a judicial determination that the material at issue was statutorily obscene. Appellant pleaded nolo contendere pursuant to plea bargain, the terms of which were followed by the trial court. Appellant did not raise this particular argument in his pretrial motions to quash, nor did he obtain the trial court's permission to argue so on appeal.

At trial, the jury found that appellee doctor had failed to disclose the risks of using the medication, but that the failure did not constitute negligence, that appellee drug company adequately disclosed the risks, and that a reasonable person would not have refused the medication had the risks been disclose. As a result, the trial court entered a take nothing judgment, and appellant sought review. The court affirmed and held that the jury's findings were not against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence, that there was no trial error in the jury instructions, and that the evidence did not establish an award of damages as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed his conviction. While the trial judge gave the jury a statutory parole charge that had since been held unconstitutional, it was not necessary to reverse appellant's conviction because the error made no contribution to his punishment. The minimum sentence for the offense was 25 years, the trial judge gave a curative instruction to the jury as to what they could and could not consider with respect to the parole laws, and the state submitted evidence of appellant's prior criminal record, which included five prior felony convictions. There was sufficient evidence to establish that the dealership was a &quot;building&quot; within the definition of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 30.01(2) (1974). That statute defined &quot;building&quot; as any enclosed structure intended for use or occupation as a habitation or for some purpose of trade, manufacture, ornament, or use.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee employee was the official court reporter for the district court. A judge of the district court signed an order fixing appellee's salary. The order raised appellee's salary by ten percent.

Subsequently, appellee filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted the summary judgment motion, awarded appellee her attorney fees, and directed the issuance of the writ of mandamus against appellants. In response, appellants sought review, in part arguing summary judgment was improper due to material fact issues regarding the abuse of discretion by the judge in raising appellee's salary, and the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees. On review, the court reversed and remanded because appellee did not establish the reasonableness of her pay raise as a matter of law, and attorney fees were not recoverable in an action brought against county institutions under Tex.

Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 21.01. 21.07, 21.08, and &sect;&sect; 4.03(a) and 4.04(a) of the Controlled Substances Act. The district court affirmed the suspension. Appellant challenged that decision. On appeal, the court affirmed. Applying the fair notice test in its constitutional analysis of &sect;&sect; 11.61(b)(7) and 104.01(2), which were regulatory statutes governing business activity, the court held that the statutes were not vague. Also, &sect; 21.01 and &sect; 21.07 were not vague. The court held that sufficient evidence supported the conclusion that appellant knew or should have known that prohibited conduct was occurring on the premises, which included the sidewalk outside the club.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for burglary of a building, contending that the trial court erred in failing to instruct a verdict of not guilty because the evidence was insufficient to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and in charging the jury regarding parole laws over timely objection. The court affirmed and held that the faulty parole instruction made no contribution to the 12-year punishment which was assessed by the jury. Even presuming that the jury followed the trial court's faulty instruction not to consider the manner in which the parole laws could have been applied to this particular defendant, the jury not only rejected appellant's sworn testimony during trial, but they were also aware of his prior convictions for burglary of a building and felony driving while intoxicated. Consequently, the court held that error was &quot;harmless error&quot; under Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2). The court overruled defendant's objection as to the sufficiency of the evidence because defendant was in possession of recently stolen property at the time of his arrest, and the jury was not required to accept his claim that he had bought all of this property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for burglary of a building because the faulty parole instruction made no contribution to the 12-year punishment which was assessed by the jury, and was thus a harmless error, and the evidence was sufficient because the jury was not required to accept his claim that he had bought all of the stolen property found in his possession at the time of his arrest.</SPAN></P>

In his first point of error, appellant contended that the trial court erred in granting the state's motion to shuffle the names of the jury panel because the venire had already been shuffled once. In his second point of error, appellant contended that the court erred in shuffling without notice to either appellant or his counsel, as well as doing so outside of their presence. In his third point of error, appellant contended that the prosecutor committed reversible error by discussing victims' rights during argument at the punishment phase of the trial, and by asking the jury to punish appellant because of the existence, and possible exercise, of his constitutional rights. In his fourth point of error, appellant contended that the court erred in charging the jury on the law of parole. After review, the court overruled appellant's first three points of error. As to the fourth point of error, appellant was harmed by the court's instruction, so the judgment was reversed as to the verdict of punishment and remanded to the trial court for a new trial on punishment.

The state had to provide in its pleadings its intention to seek a deadly weapon finding and give likewise notice when it decided not to proceed on such a finding. There was sufficient testimonial evidence to support the jury's findings that appellant did not act in self-defense. The state's misstatement of testimony was not manifestly improper. There was no evidence in the record that a memorandum was not prepared prior to the preparation of the indictment to support appellant's motion to quash the indictment. Although a jury charge on the parole law was unconstitutional, reversal was not required because there was no egregious harm to appellant given the totality of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city, through the Urban Rehabilitation Standards Board (Board), found that the vacant building owned by appellant, apartment building owner, was a public nuisance and ordered its demolition. Appellant challenged the Board's decision in the district court pursuant to Dallas City Code &sect; 27-9(e) (1960), which permitted only a limited judicial review hearing under the substantial evidence rule. On appeal, the court held that the ordinance did not violate appellant's constitutional guarantee of due process because adequate safeguards in the notices, hearings, and opportunities for compliance were provided. Appellant also contended that there was no trial on the merits and no factual evidence to support the Board's findings. There were no factual findings in the record, and the court had little basis for review and presumed that the evidence supported the judgment of the district court. Finally, the court held that appellee's action was not barred by estoppel because appellee's assertion that the building was a nuisance under Dallas City Code &sect; 16 (1960) did not judicially estop appellee from asserting that the building was a nuisance under Dallas City Code &sect; 27 (1960).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of an order of the 67th District Court of Tarrant County (Texas), that awarded appellee property owners $ 3,000 for damages to their home, $ 6,800 for destruction of fixtures and personal property, $ 19,500 for mental anguish, and $ 15,000 for attorneys' fees for damages to real and personal property resulting from the flooding of appellees' home which was adjacent to drainage ditches maintained by appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee property owners brought suit against appellant city for damages to real and personal property caused by the flooding of their home which lay adjacent to drainage ditches maintained by appellant. The trial court awarded appellees $ 3,000 for damages to their home, $ 6,800 for destruction to personal property, $ 19,500 for mental anguish, and $ 15,000 for attorneys' fees. Appellant challenged the basis for the awards except that for property damage, arguing that it was protected under the doctrine of governmental immunity. Here, evidence indicated that appellant negligently maintained a storm sewer, and was liable because such an act was ministerial in nature and could be performed by a private subcontractor. The court found that the testimony of only one appellee established injuries sufficient to constitute negligent infliction of emotional distress. Unless attorneys' fees were provided by statute or by contract, such fees were not recoverable in a tort action. Texas courts held negligently destroying property was not a taking of property. Therefore, appellees were not entitled to such fees and the court affirmed the trial court's decision in part and reversed in part.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's seven dogs' barking so disturbed defendant's neighbors that they had moved out of the bedroom that was located in closest proximity to defendant's house.

The neighbors never had problems sleeping until the problem with defendant's dogs began. Defendant was convicted on two charges of harboring a barking dog under Austin, Tex., Code &sect; 3-3-9, violation of which was a class &quot;C&quot; misdemeanor. The court affirmed the convictions. Austin, Tex., Code &sect; 3-3-9 was not unconstitutionally vague because it did not reach constitutionally protected conduct. The words used in the standard of conduct proscribed by section 3-3-9, when given their plain ordinary dictionary meanings, were understandable by a person of ordinary intelligence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers sued appellee board and appellee directors, claiming that their property appraisals were inequitable. Appellants sought review after the lower court dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction. The court found that appellants did not properly preserve their appeal under Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect; 42.08 (1988) because they paid their property taxes for the year they were claiming inequitable appraisal. Under &sect; 42.08, appellants could have paid the prior year's tax, paid taxes based on an independent appraisal, or paid taxes based on what they considered the proper property appraisal. Appellants did not preserve for review their claim that affidavits supporting appellees' pleas to the jurisdiction were defective. Appellants also claimed that Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect; 42.09 (1982) was unconstitutional because it limited the ways they could appeal appraisals. Appellants' federal and state due process rights were not violated by &sect; 42.09 because they were given the opportunity to be heard on the assessment before the valuation was finally determined and had availed themselves of all available administrative remedies and procedures.

On review, appellant argued that the trial court erred in denying her motion to quash because Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 43.21 was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed appellant's conviction. First, the court held that a statute was presumed to be constitutional. The court stated that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had held that article 43.21(a)(1)(A) was not unconstitutionally vague. The court found that appellant failed to rebut the presumption of constitutionality. Next, the court held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider appellant's argument that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction and that article 43.21(a)(1)(A) was unconstitutional based on new law because appellant failed to seek the trial court's permission to argue so on appeal. Lastly, the court held that article 43.21(a)(1)(A) complied with the law in that it incorporated the correct standard for determining whether a piece of work had any value.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the County Criminal Court at Law No. 4, Harris County, Texas, that convicted him of selling obscene materials as defined in Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.21(a)(1) (1988). Appellant argues that the trial court erred in denying his pretrial motion to quash, asserting that &sect; 43.21(a)(1) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his motion to quash, appellant failed to point out exactly what part of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.21(a)(1) (1988) was unconstitutionally vague. Thus he preserved nothing for review. Even in his brief, appellant did not identify which portion of the law was vague, and did not identify a risk or detriment to which he had been exposed without fair warning. Thus he presented nothing for review. To the extent the issue had been litigated in other cases, the statute had been upheld, and the court affirmed the denial of the motion to quash as to appellant's vagueness claim. Appellant also claimed that &sect; 43.21(a)(1) was not in line with recent United States Supreme Court jurisprudence, and that the trial court had not made a determination that the materials he sold were obscene. As to the latter point, the court noted that appellant had pleaded no contest, had not raised this argument in his motion, and had not obtained the trial court's permission to argue it on appeal. The Helms rule survived in appellant's circumstance. The court then held that the &quot;contemporary community standards&quot; language of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.21(a)(1)(A) (1988) had not been repudiated or superceded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for selling obscene material. The court held that appellant had not properly preserved or presented his void for vagueness claim as to the obscenity law. Having pleaded no contest without benefit of a plea bargain, he could not complain of an unpreserved nonjurisdictional defect. Texas obscenity law comported with current constitutional jurisprudence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner challenged his conviction of burglary because his right to a speedy trial had been denied. The court noted that U.S. Const. amend VI and Tex. Const. art. I &sect; 10 guaranteed the right to a speedy trial. The court stated that appellant made no showing of prejudice as required under the speedy trial analysis and the court held that the six-month delay did not deprive appellant of his constitutional right to a speedy trial. The court held that appellant failed to preserve his challenges to the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress his statement and appellee state's introduction of photographs of the crime scene. Appellant's objections at trial did not comport with his points of error on appeal therefore nothing was preserved for review pursuant to Tex. R. App. P. 52(a).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded nolo contendere to a charge of selling obscene materials, and received a three-day sentence in the county jail and a fine. Appellant challenged the trial court conviction against him contending error in the denial of his pretrial motion to quash on the basis that Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 43.21(a) (1988) of the Texas Obscenity Statute violated U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV. The court examined the statute and looked at precedent pertaining to the state obscenity laws, which held that its unconstitutionality had to be attacked with regard to specific applications. Appellant did not state any unconstitutional application in his challenge, thus, the presumption of the statute's constitutionality was unrebutted. Appellant also contended that sufficient evidence did not support his conviction under the obscenity statute. The court stated that, since appellant had not raised the matter below in his nolo contendere plea, he was unable to argue that point on appeal. Concluding that the Texas Obscenity Statute complied with United States Supreme Court precedent for such laws and was valid, the trial court judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his plea of nolo contendere to the charge of selling obscene material, contending that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43 (1988) was unconstitutionally vague and that the lower court erred in denying appellant's motion to quash. On appeal, the conviction was affirmed. In support of its ruling, the court held that appellant presented nothing to the court to review as he failed to enumerate what part of the obscenity statute was impermissibly vague. The court further held that appellant failed to detail for the court a risk or detriment to which he had been exposed without fair warning. The court also found that the evidence was sufficient to support appellant's conviction as the court was jurisdictionally unable to address the issue of appellant's motion to quash as it had not obtained the lower court's permission to argue such a claim on appeal. The court added that the Texas Obscenity statute, defining obscenity, was not unconstitutional as it tracked language suggested by the United States Supreme Court in drafting state obscenity statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment from the 228th District Court, Harris County (Texas), where he had been convicted for aggravated sexual assault of a child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child. He contended that his counsel had been ineffective because he failed to challenge one of the jurors for cause, object to the jury instruction on the parole law, object and preserve error to the prosecutor's closing argument at guilt/innocence, and object to the prosecutor's closing argument at punishment. The court affirmed. Without ruling whether the juror should have been struck for cause, the court held that appellant failed to show that one or more objectionable jurors sat on the jury, as was required. Five courts had upheld the constitutionality of the parole charge, including this court. Even if it was error for counsel to fail to object, the error did not warrant automatic dismissal. After considering the totality of the evidence, the grievous nature of the crime, and the fact that appellant received only a 20-year sentence, the court held that the trial court's inclusion of the parole charge was harmless. Comments responding to opposing counsel's argument were appropriate. Any other error in the state's closing argument was harmless. A prosecutor may argue his opinion as long as it is based on the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction of attempted capital murder. He contended that the trial court erred by instructing the jurors on parole eligibility where the charge was inconsistent and confusing; the charge was not authorized since Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. &sect; 37.07(4)(a) only authorized the charge in connection with offenses listed in Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. &sect; 42.12, and &sect; 42.12 has no subsection (3f)(a)(1) or (3f)(a)(2); the giving of the charge violated the doctrine of the separation of power between the executive and judicial branch, as required by Tex. Const. art I, &sect; 1. The court affirmed. Appellant made only a general objection to the trial court's instruction, which failed to preserve error. The instruction was improperly given because it constituted an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers, but he suffered no egregious harm. The court had previously held that the charge at issue was not unconstitutionally vague. Regarding subsection (3f)(a)(1) or (3f)(a)(2) in &sect; 42.12, the legislature clearly intended the reference to be to section 3g(a)(1) and 3g(a) (2) and that such a clerical error was to be disregarded.</SPAN></P>

Based on a decision of the court of criminal appeals handed down after the court's affirmation of the trial court's judgment, the court held that art. 38.071, &sect; 2 was unconstitutional because it deprived appellant of his right of confrontation and due process and due course of law on both federal and state grounds. Appellant was denied the opportunity to cross-examine the child-complainant contemporaneously with the making of the videotape of the child's testimony. Additionally, appellant had to call the child to testify in order to cross-examine her, thereby running the risk of incurring the wrath of the jury and inflaming the jury to the extent of making the trial fundamentally unfair. Because the court could not conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the error made no contribution to the conviction, Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2) mandated reversal and a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant company challenged the issuance of a temporary injunction by the 165th District Court, Harris County (Texas) that prohibited the operation of appellants' non-hazardous solid waste site until a permit was issued by appellee, the Texas Department of Health. Appellants contended error in the issuance of the temporary injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state obtained a temporary injunction in the trial court against appellant company that prohibited the operation of appellants' non-hazardous solid waste site until a permit was issued by the state through appellee, its department of health. Appellant company challenged the issuance of a temporary injunction contending error because the Solid Waste Disposal Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4477-7, &sect;&sect; 3(a), 4(e) (Supp. 1988), and other state health department regulations, were not constitutional delegations of legislative authority. Appellant contended that these laws precluded the delegation of legislative authority, including allowing appellee state health department to license solid waste disposal sites. The court noted that the legislature had authority to delegate to an administrative agency the authority to establish minimum standards that reasonably carried out the expressed purpose of a statutory act. The court determined that the Act provided adequate guidelines to the state to establish rules and regulations to reasonably carry out the express purposes of the Act, including the licensing of solid waste disposal sites. The trial court judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the issuance of the temporary injunction against appellant company. The court concluded that the Solid Waste Disposal Act (Act) and other state health department regulations were not unconstitutional delegations of legislative authority, but rather established rules and regulations that reasonably carried out the Act's purposes including allowing the state health department to license solid waste disposal sites.</SPAN></P>

Upon appellant's plea of true to an enhancement paragraph in the indictment, the jury assessed his punishment at 30 years. The trial court's jury charge included a parole charge pursuant to Tex.

Appellant first point of error on appeal argued that art. 37.07(4) was unconstitutional on separation of powers and due course of law grounds under the Texas Constitution. The court overruled appellant's first point of error because the instruction was not shown to have caused harm. Appellant's second point of error claimed that the prosecutor's peremptory strikes violated the Equal Protection Clause. The court overruled appellant's second point of error because appellant failed to carry his ultimate burden of proving that the prosecutor's neutral explanations for dismissing black members from the jury venire were a mere pretext for discrimination.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following his conviction of aggravated robbery, appellant sought review and contended that the trial court erred in denying his request for a Batson hearing and his motion to strike the jury panel. Appellant alleged that, through its use of peremptory strikes, the state engaged in the systematic exclusion of members of appellant's racial group from the jury. The court found that appellant had established a prima facie showing of purposeful discrimination because he was black, the prosecutor struck black jurors, and the prosecutor's use of her peremptory strikes caused four of only six possible black jurors to be struck. The court held that the burden was therefore on the state to produce neutral explanations for its challenges to those jurors who shared appellant's race. After reviewing the reasons given by the prosecutor, the court held that she effectively rebutted the presumption of race discrimination. Appellant also objected to the trial court's use of an instruction pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a) because the statute had been held to be unconstitutional.

Appellants claimed they were deprived of due process when the trial court excluded evidence of necessity, defense of others, and justification, and that the conditions of probation violated their free speech rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants' proffered evidence concerning harm to the unborn was inadmissible and properly excluded, as evidence concerning when life begins, development characteristics of the unborn child, and the effects of an abortion upon an unborn child were irrelevant to the crime of criminal trespass. Exclusion of other testimony concerning appellants' motivation was proper, because appellants had failed to raise a fact issue concerning necessity, defense of others, or justification. The harm sought to be avoided, namely abortions, was not greater than the harm from the abrogation of patients' privacy rights. This negated an essential element of the statutory necessity defense, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 9.22 (1974). Defense of third persons was likewise unavailable, as a fetus was not a person under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 1.07(a)(17), (27). Similarly, nobody's life or health was being threatened at the clinic, so Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 9.34(b) (1974) was inapplicable. The probation order enjoined appellants from demonstrating or picketing the clinic. This imposition on appellants' free speech right was not unconstitutional, as it was directly related to their transgressions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellants' criminal trespass convictions. The court found no abuse of discretion in the exclusion of irrelevant evidence relating to defenses not germane to the facts. The restrictions imposed as conditions of probation were appropriate to the offenses and not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held that if any error occurred, it was harmless because evidence of the burglary was admissible to show the context in which the aggravated assault occurred. Appellant next asserted that the trial court erred in permitting testimony about an extraneous offense that occurred on the night of the crime because the prosecution failed to give notice of their intent to use the extraneous offense. The court noted that Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 404(b) required notice only of those extraneous offenses that were to be introduced in the state's case-in-chief. The court held that because the offense of which appellant complained was not admitted until after the defense rested, no violation of the rule took place.

Appellant alleged that he was denied a speedy trial, that the indictment was defective, and that there was error in denying his requested jury charge on specific intent. The court affirmed, holding that the 18-month delay between arrest and trial was not violative of the speedy trial rights. The indictment properly contained the statutory words as to specific conduct and circumstances of the offense. There was no error in denying appellant's motion for an instructed verdict based upon insufficient evidence of venue because there was sufficient evidence that the offense was committed in the county where the trial was held. The state's motion for rehearing was granted because the court held that its reversal of the sentence enhancement on appellant's prior appeal was in error because, although the evidence of judgment of the prior conviction failed to meet the requirement for a judgment in Texas, there was sufficient evidence of the prior conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's case against appellant criminal for driving while intoxicated was dismissed by the trial court because the state failed to comply with the Speedy Trial Act, Tex.

Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 28.061 because they were declared unconstitutional. The court held that the subsequent declaration of the unconstitutionality of the Speedy Trial Act had no effect on the finality of the judgment. The law in effect at the time that appellant's cause was dismissed, art. 28.061, constituted a bar to further prosecution for the same offense because it provided that a discharge for failure to provide a speedy trial barred any other further prosecution for any offense arising out of the same transaction. Thus, the court held that once the trial court signed the judgment of dismissal, the judgment became final, and the jurisdiction of the same court over the same cause was exhausted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant building owner sought review of the judgment of the 162nd District Court of Dallas County, Texas, in favor of appellee city, that allowed city to demolish appellant's apartment building as a public nuisance under Dallas, Tex. Rev. City Code ch. 27 (1960), on the grounds that the statute deprived appellant of his right to due process of law, appellee's action was barred by estoppel, and that there was no trial on the merits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in favor of appellee city, which affirmed a nuisance finding against appellant building owner's building. The court held that Dallas, Tex. Rev. City Code ch. 27 (1960) was constitutional under U.S. Const. amend. V or Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. The court found that ch. 27 provided for notices of violation, hearing date, and order of demolition, as well as judicial review. Appellee availed himself of these procedural safeguards, which afforded appellant due process. The court found that the substantial evidence rule provided by ch. 27 did not prevent a judicial determination of the alleged nuisance. The court held that recitations and presumptions contained in the judgment proved a trial. The court held that appellee was not judicially estopped by an opinion that held appellant's building was not a nuisance. The court found that in that action, appellee asserted appellant's building was a nuisance under Dallas, Tex. Rev. City Code ch. 16, which did not estop appellee from asserting that the building was a nuisance under ch. 27.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court judgment that affirmed board finding of nuisance against appellee building owner's building was affirmed because city code provided for a judicial determination of the fact of nuisance, the judgment reflected the trial court held a hearing on the merits, and estoppel did not apply because appellee city could seek nuisance determination under different code chapters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought post-conviction relief from his robbery by assault conviction in favor of appellee state based on the contention he was denied a complete statement of facts and transcript for appeal and the right to effective assistance of counsel. The court rejected the argument that the alleged failure to include a note sent by the jury rendered the record incomplete when there was nothing to show appellant was precluded from excepting to the action of the trial court. The court noted the lower court held a hearing on appellant's claim and determined he did not establish the existence of any note by the judge in response to jury inquiry. The court next rejected appellant's claim of ineffective assistance. The court explained appellant failed to establish deficient performance by his attorney when counsel's performance was reasonable under prevailing professional norms. The court elaborated by noting that without a showing of harm, the failure to request recordation of voir dire or closing argument was not per se ineffectiveness and that an isolated failure to object to certain procedural mistakes did not demonstrate ineffectiveness either.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's robbery by assault conviction in favor of appellee state because appellant was not denied a complete record on appeal when no showing of an alleged note by the trial judge in response to a jury note was shown, and appellant failed to establish requisite deficient performance by counsel when his attorney rendered reasonable professional assistance under prevailing norms.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant sought review of his conviction in the 338th District Court of Harris County (Texas), for aggravated sexual assault of a minor. Appellant contended that the trial court erred when it admitted a videotaped statement, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction, that the prosecutor made improper jury arguments, and that the prosecution improperly recalled the complainant after other witnesses had testified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for the aggravated sexual assault of his 10-year-old niece. The court affirmed the conviction and the sentence enhancement. The court held that, although Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art 38.071, &sect; 2 had been declared unconstitutional, the complainant's videotaped accusation was admissible under Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 801(e)(1)(B) and Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 402. The court held that even though the prosecution referred to the complainant's vagina areas and not the complainant's vagina, a rational jury could have found contact between appellant's penis and the complainant's vagina beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that the prosecutor did not comment upon appellant's failure to testify because a comment about rehabilitation could have been directed towards the testimony of other witnesses. The record did not indicate that the prosecution referred to parole instead of sentencing. The court held that the trial court properly allowed the prosecution to recall the complainant to explain that she recanted her videotaped accusation when she first testified because she was scared of appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction and sentence were affirmed. The videotaped statement of the complainant was properly admitted, the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict, the prosecution's comments were not improper, and the complainant was properly recalled to testify.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated robbery and alleged that the trial court erred in its instructions to the jury, that jurors were improperly subjected to peremptory challenges, that the prosecution gave an improper closing argument, and that the trial court erred when it admitted certain evidence. The court affirmed, finding that appellant suffered no harm from the instructions given to the jury. While procedure prescribed by Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), had to be followed, appellant also had to make a timely objection to the prosecution's use of peremptory challenges. Appellant failed to do so; therefore, no complaint regarding the prosecution's peremptory challenges was preserved for review. With regard to appellant's other challenges, the record was facially defective in almost all regards, through waiver and lack of timely objections, and no errors had been preserved for the court's review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. Appellant's conviction for aggravated robbery was upheld, because the charge given to the jury resulted in no harm to appellant, appellant's complaints regarding jury challenges and the improper admission of certain evidence were not properly preserved for appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents' minor child lived apart from his parents and in appellee school district. Appellee refused to enroll the minor child in its schools, because appellee's policy required that students reside in the district with parents, legal guardians, or other persons with lawful control over the child. Appellants filed suit alleging that appellee's policy violated the state and federal constitutions and was contrary to the Texas Education Code. They requested a temporary restraining order to restore the status quo. The trial court denied appellants' request, and appellants filed an interlocutory appeal. The court affirmed, finding that the trial court's action was not so arbitrary as to exceed the bounds of reasonable discretion when it denied the appellants' request for a temporary injunction. Appellants, when they sought to enjoin appellee, actually sought to alter the status quo, because the minor child was already enrolled in another school district.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient challenged an order of the 281st District Court, Harris County (Texas), granting summary judgment to appellees, a pathologist and a hospital, in appellant's medical malpractice action, which alleged that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590I, &sect; 10.01 (1987), a statute of absolute limitation violated the open courts provision of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, former patient, brought a medical malpractice action against appellees, a pathologist and a hospital, for appellee pathologist's misdiagnosis of a biopsy. The court affirmed the trial court's grant of a summary judgment to appellees, holding that appellant's action was barred by the absolute two-year limitation for such actions, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590I, &sect; 10.01 (1987). Appellant argued that the statute violated the open courts provision of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. The court held that the statute's constitutionality was upheld unless a plaintiff affirmatively showed that her cause of action was not barred before she could reasonably have discovered the wrong and filed suit. Appellant had burden of proof on the issue, not appellees, but she did not address the issue in her answer or her response to summary judgment; thus she could not prevail on appeal. The court rejected appellant's argument that the statute should have been tolled because she raised a fact issue about her lack of knowledge that a wrong occurred because the issue was whether she reasonably could have discovered the wrong in two years, not whether she in fact did.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was affirmed. Appellees, a pathologist and a hospital, were entitled to summary judgment in appellant former patient's medical malpractice action, which was precluded by the statute of limitations. The absolute statute of limitations that barred her claim did not violate the state constitution, because it allowed such actions if a plaintiff could not have discovered the alleged wrong within the two year time period.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court judgment, agreeing with the state's contention on appeal that defendant equated the right to a forum and an opportunity to present his claim with the substantive right to a favorable ruling on the claim. The court reasoned that defendant was not procedurally prevented from asserting his claim, even though it was moot. Additionally, the change in the substantive law did not render defendant's trial court plea involuntary, and the change in the substantive law occurred prior to defendant's plea, thereby precluding detrimental reliance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with murder, pleaded not guilty, and was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Complainant died after being shot in the back and witnesses testified that appellant shot complainant from a few feet away. Appellant maintained that someone took his pistol and that he heard the gunfire when complainant was behind him. On appeal, appellant contended that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because it was not consistent with the nature of the wounds inflicted upon the complainant and there was no evidence that he acted recklessly. The court rejected this argument and held that there was sufficient evidence to find that appellant shot complainant from a few feet and that appellant was reckless due to his use of a deadly weapon. The court also rejected appellant's claim that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for dismissal for failure to afford appellant his constitutional statutory rights to a speedy trial in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VI, Tex. Const. art. I &sect; 10, and Tex. Crim. P. Code Ann. art. 1.03, 1.04, 1.05 (1977). The court noted that appellant waived his right to a speedy trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault, the jury having found defendant's acts or words placed the victim in fear that death, serious bodily injury or kidnapping would be imminently inflicted on her, pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.021(a)(2) (1987). On appeal, the court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment based on the state's failure to comply with Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32A.02 (1987), because that statute was unconstitutional. Defendant was not denied a speedy trial, because the state did not deliberately attempt to delay the trial in order to hamper defendant's defense and the trial delay was occasioned in substantial part by his incarceration and his trials associated with prior offenses. Testimony regarding the two extraneous offenses committed by appellant showed a similarity between the two previous rape offenses and this offense, and thus was admissible on the issue of identity. The evidence was sufficient to prove that complainant was in fear that death would be imminently inflicted on her. Accordingly, the court affirmed the holding of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) challenged the decision of the Probate Court No. 2 of Bexar County (Texas), which probated the suspension of appellee driver's license for refusal to take a breath test or offer a blood sample. Appellant claimed that an amendment to Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann art. 6687(b), &sect; 22 (e) (1987) withdrew the trial court's discretion to grant probation in breath test refusal cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) sought review of the trial court's grant of probation of the suspension of the driver's license of appellee driver for his refusal to take a breath test following his arrest for driving under the influence. Appellant argued that the amendment to Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann art. 6687(b), &sect; 22 (e) (1987), which took effect after appellee's arrest but prior to his trial, withdrew the trial court's discretion to grant probation in breath test refusal cases. The court disagreed, finding that under the Texas Code Construction Act, Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 311.031(a)(3) and (4) (1988), the law in effect at the time of the violation governed the punishment. Thus, the trial court had discretion based upon the law in existence at the time of the offense to probate the suspension of appellee's driver's license. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The lower court declared unconstitutional &sect;&sect; 6(a) and 6(b) of the Regulations of Harris County, Texas for the location of certain sexually oriented commercial enterprises and permanently enjoined appellants from enforcing the regulations. The court reversed the lower court's judgment because the county regulations were constitutional.

During the trial the aunt testified that a co-defendant purchased cocaine from defendant during the attack. The gun used by defendant was also admitted into evidence. Defendant was found guilty of aggravated sexual assault of a child and claimed on appeal that the trial court erroneously admitted into evidence the gun, evidence of other crimes, and hearsay; that the state did not provide timely notice of intent to introduce complainant's outcry; and that the jury charge on the law of parole was unconstitutional.

The court rejected each constitutional claim presented by defendant and affirmed the conviction. The court ruled that article 1918g was a constitutional legislative method which provided for an increase in the caseload of the criminal courts, and that the magistrate had county-wide authority even though the town of Vinton was excluded from its jurisdiction. The court found that the magistrate's court did not violate the election requirements of Tex. Const. Art. V, &sect; 7 because the magistrates were appointed by the district court and did not have coextensive powers. The court also found that defendant was not deprived of her right to appeal because all appealable decisions from the magistrate were issued in his capacity as presiding the referring district judge and not from the magistrate's court.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the motion to suppress the videotape was correct. The court reasoned that the videotape that depicted appellant after he invoked his right to counsel was not testimonial evidence protected by U.S. Const. amend. V.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that considering the totality of the evidence adduced at both phases of the trial, and because of the egregiousness of defendant's acts and his prior criminal record, the trial court's inclusion of the parole charge was harmless. The court held that the state supplemented the record with the trial court's findings and conclusions and defendant's claim that the trial court erred in failing to file its findings of fact pertaining to the hearing on appellant's motion to suppress his confession was moot. The court held that defendant's confession met the requirements of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.22, and that the trial court applied the proper law and did not err in concluding that defendant's confession was voluntary, and not affected by the failure to take defendant promptly before a magistrate, and that the arrest subsequent to defendant signing the confession was legal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of her convictions for unlawful delivery of amphetamines, possession of amphetamines, and possession of cocaine alleging that her motion to suppress evidence should have been granted and that her indictment should have been dismissed. The court affirmed the convictions finding that the arresting officers had jurisdiction. The court reasoned that even though the officers were outside of their city limits, Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 341.021(e) gave them jurisdiction throughout the county. The court determined that the speedy trial act (act) had previously been declared unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers doctrine of the Texas Constitution by encroaching on a prosecutor's exclusive prosecutorial discretion in preparing for trial. As a result, the court found that appellant had no rights pursuant to that act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of unlawfully possessing with intent to promote obscene material. Defendant appealed contending that the trial court erred in denying his pre-trial motion to quash because Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.21, the statute forming the basis of this action, was indefinite, uncertain, and vague. The court held that the statute had been found not to be vague. Defendant further argued that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.21(a)(1)(A), which defined obscene in terms of the average person applying contemporary community standards, was unconstitutional. The court held that the contemporary community standard was still to be applied when determining whether the work, as a whole, appealed to the prurient interest in sex, and &sect; 43.21(a)(1)(A) remained constitutional. Defendant also argued that his conduct could not be considered criminal because no judicial determination of obscenity was made prior to the transaction forming the basis of this proceeding. The court concluded that defendant failed to raise this issue in his pre-trial motion to quash, therefore, it was not preserved for appeal. Thus, the conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the trial court's affirmation of the municipal court's conviction of defendant for operating an adult arcade without a permit. Defendant contended that the city code violated U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV because the ordinance was overbroad, void for vagueness, and it effected an impermissible prior restraint on free speech. The court noted that the only actual effect of the ordinance was that patrons of adult arcades would be required to peruse openly, under specified minimum lighting, the entertainment provided. The court found that the ordinance left open ample alternative channels of communication. Furthermore, the court determined that any restriction on first amendment freedoms that might have resulted from enforcement of the ordinance was no greater than was essential to the furtherance of the governmental interests involved. The court also determined that the ordinance was not overbroad because it was precise in its language and limited in its reach. The ordinance was found to be clear, not vague. The court determined that the ordinance was not a prior restraint. Accordingly, the court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that the trial court failed in its charge to apply law to the facts regarding the issue of concurrent cause, that the trial court erred in its instruction as to legal presumption of intoxication, that it was error to sentence appellant to 120 days in jail as a condition of probation, and that a mandatory requirement of confinement as a condition to probation denied appellant of equal protection of the law. The court reversed and held that a charge that did not apply the law to the facts failed to lead the jury to the threshold of its duty which was to decide the fact issues. The court stated that the trial court should have applied the law of concurrent causation to the facts of this case. The court held that the trial court erred in its instruction in that Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of delivery of a controlled substance being less than 28 grams of amphetamine and sentenced to confinement for three years. On appeal, the court held that evidence of her extraneous offenses was admissible to refute appellant's defense of entrapment. The court found that the probative value of testimony regarding appellant's other drug transactions with undercover agents outweighed its prejudicial aspects. Because appellant admitted in her testimony that she had delivered amphetamine to an agent, the court concluded that she was not entitled to a lesser included instruction on possession. Although comments by appellee state to the jury on doing something about drugs could have been improper, the court found that the jury was told to disregard the remarks and that the error did not warrant a mistrial. Noting that the sentence imposed was on the low end of the punishment range, the court held that the impermissible instruction on parole and good-conduct time did not contribute to appellant's sentence.

Appellant contended that he was denied effective assistance of counsel and that the trial court's charge on the parole laws was reversible error. The record indicated that appellant was afforded complete discovery, and no harm had been shown. Appellant failed to show any discoverable evidence that was not found or that he had been harmed. The attorney laid the proper predicate for introducing pictures into evidence after the court reminded him of the proper procedure. The attorney did not fail to raise an objection where the objection made after non-responsive testimony could have cause the jury to speculate. The court found that the attorney's trial strategy at voir dire was insufficient to support the claim although another attorney might have used different tactics.

The court affirmed that conviction as reformed to delete the text and the jury further found that a deadly weapon, to wit, a firearm, was used during the commission of this offense on appeal. The court found that the jury instruction on the parole charge under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 (1988), was unconstitutional, but held that it was not a reversible error. The court concluded that the evidence against appellant was overwhelming, that the state's jury argument did not mention of the possibility of parole, and that appellant reminded the jury that they were not to consider the parole law's application. The court further held that it was improper to convict appellant of using a deadly weapon because neither the indictment nor any special plea informed him that the state would seek a deadly weapon finding. The court also found that evidence of appellant's misdemeanor convictions was admissible because the statutory requirement as to a written jury trial waiver only applied to felonies, and that his guilty plea for his felony to the jury was considered a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment for aggravated sexual assault under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.021(a)(2) (1987). Appellant sought review. The court affirmed, holding that appellant had a speedy trial because he was not prejudiced by the one and one-half year delay that resulted from his being tried and incarcerated for other offenses. The court held that the state presented sufficient evidence that appellant, by his conduct and words, intentionally placed the complainant in fear that death or serious bodily injury would be imminently inflicted upon her. The court held that the trial court properly admitted evidence of appellant's extraneous offenses to prove identity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl and sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. Appellant sought review, contending that the trial court denied him his right of confrontation under the United States and Texas Constitutions by allowing the state to introduce a videotaped interview of the complainant. The videotape was introduced by the state after the complainant had been cross-examined by appellant's counsel, who attempted to impeach her based on statements she made in the interview. The court overruled appellant's point of error and affirmed the conviction, holding that the videotape was admissible because it was introduced in response to appellant's attempt to impeach the witness with her interview to show that the statements were consistent with the trial testimony. The court held that since the tape was admissible, appellant's constitutional right to confront the witness against him was not violated. The court also held that any error in admitting the videotape would have been harmless because under the totality of the evidence, such error would not have affected the jury's decision to convict or assess punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with driving while intoxicated. The trial court denied appellant habeas corpus relief. Appellant alleged that his prosecution was barred since a prior complaint and information that charged him with the same offense were dismissed due to appellee state's failure to comply with the Speedy Trial Act, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32A.02 (Supp. 1988). On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of habeas corpus relief. The court found that appellant's argument that his prosecution was barred and that he was entitled to discharge was based on Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 28.061 (Supp. 1988), which provided that if an accusation was set aside for failure to provide a speedy trial, appellant would be discharged and such discharge would bar any further prosecution of the offense charged. However, the court determined that both articles were declared unconstitutional. The court ruled, therefore, that appellant was not permitted to rely on those statutes as a bar to his prosecution since an unconstitutional statute is void from its inception and could not provide a basis for any right or relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction by the 23rd District Court, Brazoria County, Texas, for robbery and alleged that the trial court committed fundamental error when it submitted the charge to the jury on the parole law pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 (Supp. 1988), since the statute was unconstitutional, and that the trial court erred when it refused to allow expert witness testimony in regard to eyewitness testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee state introduced evidence of appellant's prior felony and misdemeanor convictions. Appellee also elicited testimony from appellant that he was on parole for an aggravated robbery conviction. Appellant was convicted of robbery. On appeal, the court held that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 (Supp. 1988), was unconstitutional and the jury charge given pursuant to the statute was unconstitutional. However, since there was no objection at trial, the harm to appellant had to be egregious. The court found that the jury instruction was not egregious error and that there was no evidence that the parole charge influenced the jury's assessment of punishment since the sentence appellant received was at the lower end of the punishment spectrum and therefore the court affirmed appellant's conviction. The court also determined that the trial court did not err when it refused to allow appellant's expert witness, a psychologist, to testify about the reliability of eyewitness testimony. The court held that such expert testimony was an inadmissible attack on the credibility of a lay witness, and that cross-examination should be used to attack the lay witness' credibility instead.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Criminal District Court No. 1 of Tarrant County (Texas), which accepted appellant's guilty plea and convicted him of the offense of theft of property valued between $ 750 and $ 20, 000. Appellant asserted that the guilty plea was not voluntary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In July 1986, appellant stole an automobile valued between $ 750.00 and $ 20,000.00. In April 1987, appellant appeared at a hearing to answer charges alleged in the indictment against him. Appellant waived his right to a jury trial and agreed to stipulate to testimony. He signed an agreement in which he stipulated to evidence and knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his rights. Appellant pleaded guilty to the offense alleged, without the benefit of a plea bargain agreement. He was sentenced to thirty-five years confinement in the Texas Department of Corrections because he answered &quot;true&quot; to two enhancement paragraphs alleging prior felony convictions. On appeal, appellant challenged the voluntary nature of his guilty plea. The court affirmed the conviction because the procedure followed by the court on the record substantially followed Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 26.13 (1988), and the fact that appellant hoped to get a more lenient sentence by virtue of his guilty plea was not the type of wrong which art. 26.13 was designed to protect against.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction of theft of property valued in excess of $ 750, because his guilty plea made at hearing prior to trial with the assistance of counsel and on the record was voluntary, informed, and knowledgeable. The fact that appellant hoped to get a more lenient sentence from the court than the jury did not impair the fairness of the guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for voluntary manslaughter in the 202nd Judicial District Court of Bowie County, Texas. The trial court refused to instruct the jury about the law of parole and good time under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a) ( Supp. 1988), and gave an oral Allen charge to the jury during its deliberations without tendering a written charge to defendant for examination prior to its being read to the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and sought further review. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that defendant was not entitled to an instruction about the law of parole and good time as required by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect;4(a) (Supp. 1988), because the requested instruction was prejudicial to defendant and &sect; 4(a) was unconstitutional. The court held that the trial court's Allen charge was not harmful error because it was phrased in a manner that would not coerce the jurors into reaching a verdict just for the sake of reaching a verdict. Finally, the court found that defendant failed to preserve for review his contention that the Allen instruction should have been tendered to defendant for examination in writing before it was read to the jury under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 36.27 (1981). Defense counsel objected that the charge was not in writing but did not object to the failure to tender at trial. The court held that an objection to a failure to follow statutory procedures was necessary to preserve a claimed error when the trial court gave an Allen charge to a deadlocked jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for murdering his stepfather and challenged the conviction claiming that there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction, that it was an abuse of discretion to allow the state to reopen its case in chief after both sides had rested and that allowing the submission of parole to the jury had the effect of enhancing his punishment. The court affirmed the conviction and found that the accomplice's testimony was independently corroborated by the fact that other witness' testified about defendant talking about the murder and by the fact that defendant's signature was on the contract-for-termination. The court found that the decision to allow the state to reopen was soundly within the discretion of the trial court and defendant failed to show how he was harmed by the reopening and therefore the trial court did not abuse its discretion. The court found that defendant was not denied a fair and impartial trial because the jury was told by the state that they were not allowed to discuss the effect of parole and there was no evidence that indicated that the parole instruction influenced the jury to enhance the punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a conviction of aggravated sexual assault, defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to establish that complainant was placed in fear of imminent death and, therefore, that an element of the offense under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.012 (1988) was missing. The court recited the evidence that defendant made death threats and held a knife, and ruled that this was sufficient to support the conviction. Because all the evidence showed the aggravated nature of the assault, the court also held that there was no error in the trial court's refusal to charge the jury on the lesser offense of sexual assault. Based on the following evidence, the court held that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to have found that defendant was the perpetrator: complainant's identification of walk and manner, defendant's fingerprints at the scene, matching blood type evidence, and testimony that defendant was late for class on the day of the attack. The court found that the jury's punishment was consistent with the evidence, which showed the extreme nature of the offense, and therefore, that any error in the parole charge was harmless. The trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A complainant accused appellant of demanding his money at gunpoint. A trial court found appellant guilty of aggravated robbery and assessed punishment. The court reversed the cause with instructions that the trial court conduct a hearing to determine if there was purposeful discrimination in jury selection. The court determined that while the trial court, in its discretion, could have allowed certain questioning to show a possible bias of the complainant, it did not abuse its discretion in refusing to do so. Because appellant's counsel failed to show any other expected testimony of the two witnesses, error, if any, in refusing the request for the subpoenas was harmless constitutional error. The court found that all of the statements presented either fell within the realm of established proper jury argument, or were not so prejudicial that an instruction could not have cured any harm. The court sustained appellant's fifth point of error, asserting that the trial court committed reversible error in overruling appellant's challenge to the state's willful and systematic exclusion of blacks from the jury through peremptory challenges. Thus, the court remanded for a Batson hearing.</SPAN></P>

The jury answered yes to a special issue inquiring whether appellant had used or exhibited a deadly weapon, namely, a firearm, during the commission of the offense or during immediate flight therefrom.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, appellant was convicted of burglary of a habitation. The jury also made an affirmative finding that appellant had used or exhibited a deadly weapon, namely, a firearm, during the commission of the offense or during immediate flight therefrom. Appellant fired a firearm at a police officer after being apprehended with property taken from the burglary. Appellant argued that he was denied effective trial counsel and that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict and the affirmative finding on the firearm. The court affirmed the conviction holding that trial counsel's failure to make certain objections during trial, did not amount to ineffective assistance under the Strickland test. The court also held that letters, which appellant had written to imprisoned accomplices requesting that the accomplices deny appellant's involvement in the offense, were properly admitted as proof of appellant's guilt. Finally, the court held that the affirmative finding on the exhibiting of the deadly weapon was proper because appellant fired the firearm at the officer while attempting to run away from the consequences of his commission of the offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court, which convicted appellant of burglary of a habitation, enhanced by a prior felony conviction, and the jury answered &quot;yes&quot; to a special issue inquiring whether appellant had used or exhibited a deadly weapon, namely, a firearm, during the commission of the offense or during immediate flight therefrom; appellant was not denied effective trial counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county court entered a judgment in favor of appellee gas company ordering that appellant property owners' property be condemned and that appellee pay appellants compensation for the taking.

Appellants argued, on appeal, that the house bill, which conferred jurisdiction of the matter, concurrent with the district court, on the county court was unconstitutional and that appellee failed to pled sufficient facts in invoke the county court's special subject matter jurisdiction. The court affirmed the order of the district court holding that Tex. Const. art. &sect; 22 (repealed), only required that the legislature, when conferring subject matter jurisdiction upon a court, conform the jurisdiction of another court only when the legislature made changes to the other court's jurisdiction, not upon a grant of concurrent jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In challenging his conviction for burglary, appellant asserted that reversible error occurred when the state's attorney referred to matters outside the record in his argument against the credibility and believability of two witnesses. The court found that the state did inject a new fact before the jury, but the court concluded that the argument did not specifically and affirmatively violate a mandatory statute, and the record showed that the new injected fact was not harmful to appellant, so there was no reversible error. The court found that when the state admitted a pen packet into evidence reflecting appellant's prior conviction for aggravated robbery, the sentence was incorrectly stated as being a minimum of two years instead of the correct minimum of five years, but that mistake did not render the conviction void, and there was no error in admitting it. The court held that the burden was on appellant to demonstrate that he was egregiously harmed by the parole law jury instruction, and appellant failed to object to the instruction or point out to the court where egregious harm could be found in the record, so there was no fundamental error. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 1.07(1), the test for determining what was a deadly weapon was either &quot;objective&quot; or &quot;subjective:&quot; a firearm or anything manifestly designed, made, or adapted for the purpose of inflicting death or serious bodily injury; or anything in the manner of its use or intended use that was capable of causing death or serious bodily injury. The court held that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that the bat was a deadly weapon. The complainant testified that he thought defendant was going to strike him with the bat, and a police officer testified that the bat defendant used was capable of causing serious bodily injury or death.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction from the 179th District Court of Harris County (Texas), for two separate offenses of aggravated kidnapping, after a joint jury trial with two co-defendants. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in instructing the jury and in requiring him to submit a redacted statement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who was convicted of aggravated kidnapping, admitted that he did not request an instruction on mitigation or object to the charge that was given, and the court found that the evidence did not support the issue of voluntary release within the statutory meaning, only intent to release, since there was still the possibility that the complainants could be harmed in a rescue action. In light of the evidence, the totality of the proceedings, and the severity of the offense, the court found that appellant did not suffer any egregious harm from the parole law jury charge, despite assessment of the maximum punishment. Appellant asserted that the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on the lesser included offense of false imprisonment. However, the court held that appellant's restraint of the complainants was in a place where he knew that they were unlikely to be found, so the jury could not have reasonably concluded that he was guilty only of false imprisonment. Appellant failed to preserve any error in forcing him to redact his written statement for appeal. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. Whether or not appellant had any intent to release the complainants, there was no voluntary release within the statutory meaning.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant land lessee applied to appellee Texas Railroad Commission for a permit to drill and complete a well in a natural-gas field. There were several wells that surrounded the small tract. Appellee's spacing rules stated that the minimum distance between a well and the nearest property or lease line was 330 feet, but they allowed an exception when it was necessary to prevent waste or confiscation of the property. The distance between appellant's proposed well to the boundaries of her small tract was only 20 feet in either direction. Appellee determined that appellant was not entitled to the exception because she had not shown that it was necessary to prevent confiscation of any right she had acquired. The trial court refused to reverse appellee's final order. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Appellant did not show that her needs fit under the exception. Appellant was accorded a fair opportunity with producers of surrounding tracts within the drainage area to recover her fair share of natural gas beneath her tract. Appellant could not acquire from her lessor a right to a well permit to prevent confiscation when the lessor himself had none.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed the finding of the court that &sect; 46.06(a)(7) was unconstitutionally vague, and remanded for the court to address appellant's remaining points of error. On appeal, the court affirmed, and held that the evidence admitted at trial was sufficient to support appellant's conviction. The record showed that the device appellant possessed was a tear gas grenade manufactured for the U. S. armed forces for the purpose of riot control. In addition, the grenade was not sold commercially. The court also held that the indictment was not void because the state failed to plead that what appellant possessed was a chemical dispensing devise other than one sold commercially for personal protection. Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 2.02 required only that the indictment negate express exceptions so labeled in the code, not implied exceptions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, convicted of burglary for entering a boathouse and taking personal property therein without consent of the owner, sought relief from the conviction. The court affirmed the trial court's conviction of appellant because the boathouse was a building or enclosed structure, under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 30. 01(2), as it was intended for use or occupation as a habitation or for some purpose of trade, manufacture, ornament or use. Appellant's argument that evidence was insufficient to show that the boathouse was a building under the statute failed. Though the boathouse was on the surface of a lake and could be entered by swimming under the structure, it was an enclosed structure to secure the owner's boat and property and used for storage. The doors to the boathouse closed and locked. The court found no merit in appellant's position that it was error not to instruct the jury to disregard appellant's parole for past convictions. The trial court in no way mentioned parole to the jury. The court found appellant's indictment did not fail for lack of listing property taken or the owner of the stolen property and held that appellant's indictment gave adequate notice of the charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction of appellant by the trial court because the boathouse appellant entered was a building as defined in the burglary statute, it was not error for the trial court to disregard jury instructions concerning appellant's past parole, and appellant's indictment gave adequate notice of the charges against him even though it failed to list items taken and name of the property owner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a resident of Texas, was sought for extradition by Louisiana for the offense of simple burglary. Appellant sought a writ of habeas corpus to challenge the validity of the extradition statute and the Louisiana documents. The court denied the writ and held that the record clearly showed that appellant's counsel was permitted to argue the facts supporting her contentions. The amended petition, which the trial court denied leave to file, was not in the record, thus, the court could not determine if the requirements of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 11.14 (1977) were met. The court refused to consider, on appeal, bond hearing issues that were not presented to the trial court. The Louisiana Governor's Warrant was a self-authenticating public document that was regular on its face and met all the requirements of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 51.13, &sect; 3 (1979) and was properly admitted. Appellant presented nothing for review to say that the extradition statute was unconstitutional, or that being held more than 90 days was error. Article 51.13 conformed to U.S. Const. amends. IV and XIV, and appellant had no right to be arraigned prior to extradition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which denied appellant a writ of habeas corpus, and held that appellant's counsel was permitted to argue appellant's contentions, that the extradition documents were in order and meet all Texas requirements, and that appellant had no right to be arraigned prior to extradition. On all other points of error, appellant presented nothing for review by the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant possession with the intent to deliver at least 400 grams of cocaine. He was sentenced to 17 years in prison and to pay a fine. Defendant contended his conviction and sentence should be overturned due to instructional error by the court and improper prosecutorial argument. The court rejected both contentions and affirmed. It was not automatically reversible error for the trial court to instruct the jury on the law of parole and good time conduct under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07 (4) (1988). Because defendant did not object to the lower court's charge, defendant had to show that the error was so egregious and created such harm that he did not receive a fair and impartial trial, in light of the entire jury charge, the voir dire, the evidence of guilt, the argument of counsel, the actual punishment assessed, and any other relevant information. Defendant did not sustain this burden. Further, the prosecutor's reference, during sentencing argument, to matters of public knowledge and to evidence outside the record merited no relief on appeal because the statements were not so manifestly improper as to constitute reversible error.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that the trial court's charge on parole law pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of burglary of a motor vehicle with intent to commit theft, determined two enhancement paragraphs to be true, and assessed punishment at 50 years' confinement. Defendant appealed, challenging the constitutionality of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 (1988), pursuant to which the trial court instructed the jury on the law of parole and good conduct. Defendant made no objection to the instruction at trial. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding although art. 37.07, &sect; 4 had recently been declared unconstitutional, any error in giving an instruction pursuant to the statute did not warrant automatic reversal. Because defendant did not object at trial, reversal was required only if the error was so egregious and created such harm that defendant was denied a fair and impartial trial. The actual degree of harm had to be determined in light of the entire jury charge, the state of the evidence, the argument of counsel, and any other relevant information contained in the record.

He appealed on the ground that his motion to dismiss should have been granted because the arresting officer was not in proper uniform, pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

The court affirmed the conviction, and held that art. 6701d-9 was unconstitutional, following a 1931 court of criminal appeals ruling on a nearly identical statute, and citing Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 28, which provided that no power of suspending laws in the state would be exercised except by the legislature. The court reasoned that the arresting officer could not be vested with the option to either enforce the law or, discarding his uniform, suspend it as he pleased.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the state's evidence that the property was derived from the sale or distribution of drugs was unpersuasive where the arresting officer admitted he never personally observed appellant in any drug transaction and did not have personal knowledge that the money was the proceeds of a drug transaction. The court held that it was just as likely that the manner in which the drugs were packaged indicated they were recently purchased rather than prepared for sale. The fact that the forfeited property was found at, or near, the controlled substance did not establish the required nexus. The court also held that the trial court erred in failing to suppress the evidence because the arresting officer was permitted only to handle the bags in appellant's purse in a manner to determine whether any of them contained a weapon.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review, and the court reversed, finding that the record clearly showed that one juror consistently exhibited a prejudice against the law which set the minimum punishment for the offense of murder at five years' probation, and her statements revealed that she would only consider such punishment appropriate in a mercy killing. The court found that this was a prejudice against the minimum legal punishment for which a challenge for cause may be made under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.16(c) (1966). The trial court erred in permitting the state to attack appellant's trial attorney during closing argument because the attacks struck at the core of appellant's exculpatory story and violated appellant's right to counsel under U.S. Const. amend. VI. The court found that the trial court did not err in instructing the jury as to the law of parole and good time credit as mandated by Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

The court affirmed, finding that appellant failed to show by summary judgment evidence that the &sect; 3 provision, which waived the right to common law or statutory actions against an employer, was unconstitutional as it applied to her son, a minor. The court found that due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Tex. Const. art.

Appellant wrote to the Texas authorities and requested a speedy trial and disposition of all charges. After his transfer from Arizona to Kansas, appellant was moved to Texas on the outstanding warrant. Appellant stood trial in February, 1987.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bank sued appellee city for damages resulting from appellee's demolition of two buildings on which appellant had a lien. A jury found that the buildings constituted a nuisance and determined their value. The lower court refused to allow appellant a recovery and entered a take nothing judgment. Appellant argued that it should have recovered the market value of the buildings. Appellant also claimed that the ordinance that authorized the demolition of the buildings was unconstitutional because it did not provide for notice to those holding liens on the property to be destroyed. The court agreed that the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to appellant because it provided for notice and an opportunity of hearing to the property owners, but it did not provide for any notice to appellant. The court affirmed the take-nothing judgment. To recover the damages resulting from the demolition of the buildings, the court found that appellant had the burden to secure a finding on the amount necessary to bring the buildings into compliance. Having failed to request an issue on that ground of recovery, appellant waived it and there was no basis on which to award damages.</SPAN></P>

Appellant public officials had been elected as Justices of the Peace and filed suits alleging that the order was void because it violated the Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 65. The trial court upheld the order and denied appellants all relief sought by them. After review, this court concluded that the order did not conflict with the provision of the Texas Constitution, enabling legislation was not required in order for appellee to take the action, and the order was not arbitrary and capricious. The court held that appellee did not abuse its discretion by passing the order, and appellee was not required to accept appellants' oath of office and issue a certificate of election since the office had already been lawfully abolished; there was no constitutional or statutory limit on when the order had to become effective.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant chiropractor disputed a decision of the 200th District Court of Travis County (Texas), which upheld the order of appellee Texas State Board of Chiropractic Examiners revoking appellant's license to practice chiropractic. He argued that he was denied his right to a jury trial, he was improperly required to delete causes of action from his complaint, the order was invalid, appellee exceeded its authority, and he was denied due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant chiropractor was placed on probation by appellee Texas State Board of Chiropractic Examiners. Based on a second incident and four other grounds, appellee revoked appellant's license. The district court upheld the order. On appeal, the court held that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4512b, &sect; 14(d) did not provide &quot;de novo&quot; review, so it required a judge-only trial. 1981 Tex. Gen. Laws 781, &sect;1 constitutionally rescinded any right to jury trial. Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 15 was limited to rights existing in 1876. Even though it was a property right, the license was subject to statutory revocation. Special circumstances made a jury trial inappropriate. The district court had not abused its discretion in deleting causes of action. Appellant did not challenge the probation, so revocation based on its violation validated the revocation. Appellee had the authority to revoke the license. The 1983 amendment of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4512b, &sect;14a did not indicate that the authority had not existed before the amendment, which was constitutionally valid even though it had no title. Appellant was not denied due process. He was not prejudiced by any findings. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the trial court (Texas), which convicted him of burglary of a motor vehicle. He argued that it was error to refuse to permit him to enter a plea on double jeopardy grounds, that the fruits of an inventory search of his automobile should have been suppressed, that a jury instruction was based on an unconstitutional statute and was misleading, and that the evidence was insufficient to show an intent to commit theft.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant disputed a conviction for burglary of a motor vehicle. In an earlier trial on the charge, he had moved for a mistrial based on the state's failure to make disclosures. The court pointed out that defendant did not have a general right to discover evidence from the state. The court held that the trial court had not erred in refusing to allow defendant's plea in bar, because there was no evidence that the prosecutor had intentionally provoked defendant's motion for a mistrial. The court reviewed the circumstances surrounding defendant's arrest, and held that entry into his automobile was reasonable, and that an inventory was authorized to protect the vehicle. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 (Supp. 1987) was unconstitutional. However, any error in the jury charge was harmless. There was no evidence that the instruction denied defendant a fair trial by influencing the jury to enhance his punishment. The instruction was not misleading. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, defendant's entry into the vehicle was proved by testimony and his intent to commit theft could be inferred from the circumstances. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a jury verdict from the 337th District Court, Harris County (Texas), convicting him of possession of a controlled substance, to wit, cocaine weighing less than 28 grams.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his jury conviction for possessing a controlled substance, namely, cocaine weighing less than 28 grams. Defendant argued that the prosecutor's closing argument at the punishment phase of trial implied that defendant was guilty of the more serious crime of delivery of a controlled substance. On appeal, the court held that the prosecutor's argument was not tantamount to asking the jury to assess additional punishment for an act for which defendant was neither indicted nor tried. Rather, the prosecutor was attempting to persuade the jury to assess a more severe punishment within the sentencing range permitted for the crime of possessing cocaine. The trial court's instructing on the law of parole and good time as required by Tex. Crim. P. Code Ann. art. 37.07, &sect;4 (1987) was not unconstitutional and was, at most, harmless error because defendant failed to contemporaneously object. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for possession of a controlled substance, finding that the prosecutor's sentencing argument was not the equivalent of asking the jury to convict for a more serious crime, delivery of a controlled substance, with which defendant was not charged but, rather, urged the jury to impose the longest sentence permitted under the range of sentences for possession.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction in the 339th District Court, Harris County (Texas) where he was found guilty by a jury of murder and of attempted murder. Two enhancement paragraphs were found true. Punishment was assessed at 35 years confinement in each case. Defendant claimed error in the denial of his motion for mistrial, as a juror saw him handcuffed, and in a jury instruction on parole under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction by a jury of murder and of attempted murder. He had moved for a mistrial after a juror saw him in handcuffs while being transported to the courtroom and had objected to a jury instruction on parole under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4. He urged that it was error to deny his motion and overrule his objection to the instruction. The court affirmed defendant's conviction where although the instruction under art. 37.07, &sect; 4 was error, as the statute had been found unconstitutional, the error was not automatically reversible. The court stated a showing of harm was required for reversal and found the instruction harmless where, in light of the entire jury charge, the evidence, and the jury argument, there was no evidence that the instruction influenced the jury to enhance punishment. The court further found that although his constitutional presumption of innocence may have been infringed by a juror seeing him handcuffed, an inadvertent glimpse of him by a juror was not necessarily so prejudicial as to require reversal of his conviction, where as such prejudice could have been cured by a jury instruction which he had failed to request.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of defendant's conviction of murder and attempted murder was affirmed where, although the jury instruction based on the unconstitutional parole statute was error, the instruction was harmless as there was no evidence that the parole charge influenced the jury to enhance defendant's punishment, and he had failed to request a curative instruction as to any infringement of the presumption of innocence when a juror saw him handcuffed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand from the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, wherein defendant's petition for discretionary review was granted and the court's judgment, that Tex.

App. P. 81(b)(2) of the error in an instruction on art. 37.07, &sect; 4 when the court of criminal appeals held in another case that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had petitioned for discretionary review of the court's judgment rejecting defendant's argument that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the parole law under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 as the statute was unconstitutional. The Texas Criminal Court of Appeals, having ruled in another case that art. 37.07, &sect; 4 was unconstitutional, therefore granted defendant's petition, vacated the court's judgment, and remanded for a harm analysis under Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2) of the error from the jury instruction. In affirming the judgment of defendant's conviction of murder, the court held that, beyond a reasonable doubt, the error in giving the jury instruction under art. 37.07, &sect; 4 was harmless where it made no contribution to the punishment assessed. The court based its holding on its findings as to the lack of emphasis on the parole statute by the parties throughout the course of the trial, coupled with the particular facts of the offense committed by defendant, where there was evidence that he had shot the victim in the back while the victim was fleeing from him and that the victim may have been unarmed, and defendant's prior criminal record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated, pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701(1). The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague and found that the state proved that defendant drove a motor vehicle while intoxicated and that he drove it in a public place. The court determined that questions such as name, address, and telephone number were not interrogation under Miranda and that defendant's U.S. Const. amend. V rights were not violated when police asked him questions which were not reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. The court held that the statute allowed evidence that defendant refused to take the breathalyzer test to be admitted as evidence of guilt, and held that the trial court properly refused to give an instruction that defendant's refusal to take the test was not to be considered an admission of guilt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested without warrant after several witnesses identified him to police as the one who robbed and killed a taxi cab driver. A jury later found defendant guilty of murder. Defendant contended that the lower court's parole charge was erroneously given, however, defendant did not object to such charge at trial. The court held that where the only obvious purpose for defendant's shooting of an unresisting victim to a completed robbery was to eliminate her as a witness, such facts were more likely than the lower court's error in giving the parole instruction to have brought about a verdict of life imprisonment; therefore, the instruction was not so egregious and harmful as to deprive defendant of a fair and impartial punishment hearing. Furthermore, the court held that where no objection was made as to the admissibility of certain evidence resulting from defendant's arrest and defendant alleged ineffective counsel on appeal, defendant had the burden to establish that his arrest did not comply with any exception allowing a warrantless search and defendant failed to meet such burden. As such, the court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of violating the seat belt law by a municipal court; on appeal the county criminal court at law affirmed. On appeal thereafter, appellant challenged the constitutionality of the seatbelt law, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701d, sec. 107C (Supp. 1987). Appellant contended that the seatbelt law violated the due process and the equal protection clauses of the Texas and United States Constitutions by taking away his liberty interest found in U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court noted that the liberty interest was guaranteed to be free from arbitrary interferences, but was not immunity from reasonable regulations. The court found that the imposition of a state seatbelt law was a reasonable exercise of state power in that it bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest that was not arbitrary or discriminatory, i.e., keeping public roads safer.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated kidnapping in the trial court. Appellant challenged his convictions pointing out errors with the insufficiency of the evidence in both enhancement paragraphs, the trial court's failure to instruct on a lesser included offense, the admission of a statement by appellant's co-defendant, and the court's instruction to the jury on good conduct time and parole. The court looked at the first two errors asserted by appellant together and agreed that the state had erred in presenting the enhancement paragraphs. The court noted that a conviction that was appealed from was not final until affirmed by the appellate court and the issuance of a mandate. In this case, the state had failed to prove that the conviction alleged in the first paragraph, attempted burglary of a habitation, became final prior to the commission of the offense alleged in the second paragraph, aggravated robbery. The court stated that because the state did not meet its burden of proof as to either enhancement paragraph, it was precluded from use of the enhancement paragraphs on retrial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged and convicted of a criminal offense. Appellant challenged his conviction, arguing that the jury charge given under Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a) was erroneous because the statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed appellant's conviction, holding that the jury charge was not unconstitutional. Appellant then filed a motion for rehearing, arguing that recent binding court precedent had held that the jury charge was unconstitutional. The court determined that in light of the new authority holding the statute unconstitutional, it was error for the jury to be charged pursuant to art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a). However, the court determined that the error was harmless, because the error occurred at the punishment phase of the trial, and appellant received the exact number of years he asked for, albeit without probation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of delivery, and aggravated delivery, of marijuana by a District Court, Dallas County (Texas) pursuant to open pleas of guilty. On appeal, appellant contended error in the refusal of the lower court to permit him to plead anew or to withdraw his prior pleas because they were not intelligently entered into and voluntarily made.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded guilty to delivery, and aggravated delivery, of marijuana and was convicted in the trial court; he then appealed. Appellant, although sentenced improperly, had not advised the trial court of the error through any type of motion, and did not attempt to withdraw the guilty plea. The criminal appeals court remanded to the trial court for resentencing. Appellant also had filed a petition for discretionary review in the criminal appeals court, contending that the appeals court erred in holding that he could not enter a not guilty plea upon remand. The court found that the criminal appeals court erred in failing to remand the cause for resentencing. The judgment of the court of appeals was reversed and the case remanded to the trial court for resentencing. At the remand hearing, appellant told the trial court that he had been incorrectly admonished as to the penalty range and sought to plea anew or withdraw his prior pleas. The trial court held that it had no discretion to allow that. On appeal, the court affirmed because the mandate of the criminal appeals court did not allow a lower court to act under its own discretion to consider appellant's request.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction, holding that mandates of the criminal appeals court had to be literally read and applied and that only that court was able to interpret or amend its mandates in light of subsequent developments. The trial court was without power to permit withdrawal of the pleas of defendant to delivery, and aggravated delivery, of marijuana.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with indecency with a child. As part of the state's case-in-chief, the trial court allowed the prosecutor to introduce into evidence a videotaped interview with the complainant child in accordance with Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 38.071 (1986). The complainant child also testified at trial, and was subject to cross-examination. Appellant was found guilty of the charge, and challenged his conviction, arguing that videotape of the interview violated his right to confrontation under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Appellant also claimed that the videotape violated his right to due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. The court held that because art. 38.071 had previously been declared unconstitutional, appellant was not required to object to the admission of the videotaped interview. The court determined that, based upon binding court precedent, the trial court erred in admitting the taped interview, because it violated appellant's right to confrontation and due process. The court reversed the conviction, and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon, and sentenced to fifty years confinement. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of trial court and remanded the cause for a new trial of punishment only. The court held that the trial court committed reversible error in admitting evidence of a previous judgment and sentence of appellant for theft of property in order to enhance or increase appellant's minimum punishment for the committed offense, because appellant was on shock probation for this earlier offense at the time he committed the aggravated robbery, and his probation had not been revoked.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon being arrested for an unrelated felony, appellant made a written confession, admitting that he had committed an assault on complainant. The jury found him guilty of felony burglary with intent to commit sexual assault and found that he used a deadly weapon. The jury also found the enhancement paragraph allegation true. Appellant did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence. The court withdrew its original opinion in this matter and substituted the present opinion, which reformed the judgment so that the phrase &quot;affirmative finding of a deadly weapon&quot; was deleted. The court stated that the original opinion did not take notice of case law which required the State to &quot;plead&quot; that it would seek an affirmative finding of deadly weapon use in either the indictment or by a special plea as authorized by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 27.01(1966).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for the offense of aggravated sexual assault under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.021(a)(5) (1987). The trial court assessed punishment at confinement for 20 years. The judgment was affirmed on count one and vacated on count two of the indictment. The court rejected defendant's contention that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. The court found that counsel's decision to elect punishment by the court, thereby precluding defendant from consideration for probation, could have been based upon counsel's mistaken belief of the trial court's ability to grant probation or a trial strategy as the case concerned the aggravated sexual assault of a three-year-old, a crime the jury panel expressed its distaste for throughout the trial. Further, defendant failed to establish a reasonable probability the jury would have granted him probation. Based on defendant's unequivocal confession and other evidence, defendant also failed to show that had counsel objected to the introduction of videotape prepared in accordance with Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.071, &sect; 2(1987) and had the tape been excluded, the outcome of the trial would have been different.</SPAN></P>

Appellants, city and mayor, sought review of a judgment from a district court of Grayson County, Texas, that declared appellee was constitutionally created and its actions, particularly the issuance of certain bonds, constitutionally taken. All parties were enjoined from challenging these issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Greater Texoma Utility Authority desired to use certain property purportedly voluntarily annexed by appellant city as a landfill site.

Appellants, city and its mayor, alleged that appellee was an improper party plaintiff as it was unconstitutionally created, did not exist as an entity which could bring suit, and had engaged in various void actions. Appellee then brought a class action suit for a declaratory judgment under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 717m-1(1986) to have appellant city, its actions, and specifically a bond issuance declared constitutional. Appellants sought review of that declaratory judgment. The court vacated the actions of the trial court and dismissed the cause. The court found that appellee undisputedly failed to literally comply with the Open Meetings Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Stat. Ann. art. 6252-17(1987), that substantial compliance was not sufficient, and that as a result of a meeting held in violation of the Act, appellants were placed in the position of posting a $ 2,000,000 bond or losing any claim it had against appellee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of judgment in favor of appellee telephone companies in a declaratory judgment suit on a tariff under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 22.221(a), in the 299th District Court of Travis County (Texas). Specifically, appellants challenged the denial of their request for injunctive relief from appellees' disconnection of their &quot;976&quot; service.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of denial of injunctive relief in favor of appellee telephone companies in a suit to have a tariff declared invalid under Tex. Gov't Code &sect; 22.221(a), in connection with the disconnection of their &quot;976&quot; number for violations of the applicable tariff. The court affirmed the judgment, explaining that its review was limited to a determination of whether the order denying the application for a temporary injunction was an abuse of discretion. The court concluded that no abuse of discretion was shown when the lower court could have properly concluded that no state action and discriminatory motive existed as to appellees' decision to disconnect. The court rejected the argument that the district attorney's call to appellees was such coercive state action when appellees had already completed an investigation that determined that appellants were in violation of the tariff. The court further determined that there was no abuse of discretion by the lower court in its conclusion that no unlawful discrimination existed in the prohibition of live communication on the &quot;976&quot; service because a reasonable basis for appellees' dissimilar treatment was shown.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment denying appellants injunctive relief and declaring appellee telephone companies' tariff valid. The court held that no abuse of discretion in the decision existed because appellants failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability of success on the merits, as unreasonable discrimination did not exist and the decision to disconnect service was not a product of state action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed the decision of several County Criminal Courts at Law, Harris County (Texas), which affirmed their convictions in municipal court for operating adult arcades without a permit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals of numerous defendants of their convictions for violation of an ordinance regulating adult arcades were consolidated for appeal. The court affirmed the convictions, holding that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The ordinance made clear what it prohibited. When the ordinary meanings of the statutory words were applied, the ordinance was clear as to what it provided. The standards given in the ordinance, coupled with the permit application and denial provisions, were sufficient to prevent arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement by the police chief. The police chief was afforded no discretion under the ordinance but was required to grant the permit if the requirements of the ordinance were met. The court held that the ordinance was not directed at any constitutionally protected conduct or material but was clearly a regulation of the business of adult arcades. The ordinance was not a prior restraint on free speech because the ordinance sought to meet important governmental interests which were within the power of a city government and those interests were unrelated to the suppression of free expression.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner sought review of the lower court's grant of summary judgment to appellees, school, hospital, and county, for ad valorem taxes. Appellant claimed there were fact questions which precluded summary judgment, that the administrative remedy was unconstitutional, and that summary judgment was precluded by Tex. Prop. Tax Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 21.01 and 42.09. Appellant claimed he paid taxes in the county of his principal place of business and was not responsible for taxes in a county where he rented property to keep equipment. The court found that the property tax code met due process requirements because it included a right of protest and a right of appeal, but that administrative remedies must be first exhausted before there could be a judicial challenge to a tax assessment. Because appellant did not exhaust administrative remedies, his constitutional argument was overruled. The court held that tax statements and the affidavit of a tax collector that the statements were true and correct was sufficient evidence to support a prima facie showing of appellant's liability for the taxes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction after a guilty plea in a District Court of Dallas County (Texas), for possession of phenylacetone with intent to manufacture amphetamine, alleging that the statute under which he was convicted was applied retroactively and the scope of the search which led to the seizure of the contraband exceeded the authorization of the search warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of phenylacetone with intent to manufacture amphetamine and pleaded guilty. On appeal challenging the application of the statute to his factual situation, the court reversed. The court held that on the date of defendant's arrest, possession of phenylacetone alone was not proscribed by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 2.04(f)(2). The court held that the amended statute, as applied to defendant, constituted an unconstitutional retroactive application of the law. The failure to charge defendant with criminally prohibited conduct prevented the instrument presented by the grand jury from meeting the constitutional requirements of an indictment. Defendant's failure to object to the instrument was not fatal to his appeal. Because the instrument presented to the trial court did not constitute an indictment, the trial court's jurisdiction was not invoked. Such an error constituted a jurisdictional defect which the court had the power to consider pursuant to Tex. R. App. P. 40.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction for possession of phenylacetone with intent to manufacture amphetamine reversed and the purported indictment dismissed on the grounds that the ex post facto application of the law resulted in an instrument which failed to allege a criminal offense and defendant did not waive the right to complain of the lack of an indictment vesting the trial court with jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee insurance company employees obtained an order that permanently enjoined appellant industrial accident board from pursuing an investigation of appellees for alleged unfair claims handling practices. Appellant sought review of that order and, in so doing, did not designate an appellate court in its notice of appeal.

The supreme court dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction. Appellant thereafter sought review in a regular appeal, and appellees filed a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction. The court granted appellees' motion, finding that pursuant to Tex. R. App. P. 140, appellant had the option of pursuing a regular appeal or a direct appeal to the supreme court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction for voluntary manslaughter, claiming that his due process rights were violated when the state failed to inform him of its intention to seek an affirmative finding of use of a deadly weapon and error in overruling his objection to the state's closing argument improperly urging the expectations of the community. The court sustained defendant's allegation concerning the deadly weapon finding, concluding that the state had to provide notice of its intentions to submit a deadly weapon finding and failure to provide such notice was fundamental error. The court ordered that the trial court's affirmative finding on the deadly weapon issue be deleted, but that defendant's conviction was affirmed in all other respects. The court concluded that the state's argument to the jury did not improperly exert the expectations of the community, but was a plea to the jury to do its duty to assess a proper punishment for the crime committed. The court determined that after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the verdict, any rational trier of fact could have found all the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sexual assault and sentenced to nine years confinement and a fine. Defendant filed for discretionary review in light of an opinion of the court of appeals that held that the parole and good conduct charge authorized by Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

After reviewing the evidence, the court found that the erroneous jury instruction was not harmless error because defendant received a punishment roughly in the middle of the sentence range for the offense and there was a reasonable possibility that the instruction contributed to the sentence imposed. The sentence was reversed and the case remanded to the trial court for a new trial on the issue of punishment.</SPAN></P>

There was sufficient evidence for the jury to find found the essential elements of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt. The state's neutral explanations for exercising a peremptory challenge to the only black juror, offered at the Batson hearing, rebutted defendant's prima facie showing of purposeful discrimination.

On appeal, the court rejected defendant's arguments and affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that there was no defect in the indictment, and that defendant did not meet his burden of rebutting the state's prima facie showing of compliance with the Speedy Trial Act with evidence demonstrating that the state was not actually ready for trial during the prescribed time period.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty, pursuant to a plea bargain agreement, to the charge of burglary of a building and was sentenced to 10 years confinement. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss for denial of a speedy trial and that his conviction was based on a plea that was not made knowingly and voluntarily. The court held that defendant's complaint regarding a speedy trial was moot because the Speedy Trial Act, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32A.02 (1987), violated the separation of powers doctrine by unconstitutionally controlling the prosecutor's exclusive discretion in preparing for trial. The court held that a plea of guilty was involuntary where the terms of a plea bargain were impossible to fulfill, and a guilty plea would not support a conviction if that plea was motivated by significant misinformation conveyed by the court or one of its officers. The court held that nothing in the record showed any misinformation was conveyed by the court or its officers and affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Thus, when defendant did not include the photographs in contention as part of the record, his contention was overruled. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant when the evidence was viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, even though the facts showed some evidence of self-defense, because the jury was the sole judge of witness credibility.

Penal Code Ann. &sect;19.05(a)(2)(1974). Appellant claimed that the trial court erred in declaring a mistrial on its own motion due to the absence of a juror and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 6b(c) was unconstitutional and not applicable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with involuntary manslaughter by reason of intoxication pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.05(a)(2)(1974). A jury was selected but one juror felt she was related to victim and a mistrial was granted. A second jury was selected but one juror was absent and a mistrial was declared. Appellant moved for dismissal. The trial court denied the motion and a third jury was selected that found appellant guilty. The trial court imposed a special condition of probation pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 6b(c) (1987) requiring appellant to serve 120 days in confinement after the jury assessed probation. Appellant contended the trial court erred in declaring a mistrial and retrial was barred by double jeopardy. He argued that art. 42.12, &sect; 6b(c) denied him rights and was not applicable when the jury recommended probation. The appellate court affirmed and held the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declaring a mistrial and the subsequent retrial was not barred. The court ruled that there was no infringement of appellant's rights and the trial court had the authority to require appellant to serve 120 days as a condition of probation.</SPAN></P>

Additionally, the applicable statute clearly mandated the trial court to require as a condition of probation that appellant serve not less than 120 days in a penal institution.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed, holding that admission into evidence of a photo album depicting sexually explicit photographs was error because it had been seized pursuant to a defective search warrant. In so ruling, the court noted that the affidavit for the search warrant contained neither the date the offense occurred, nor the date that the album was seen in appellant's residence. Further, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.23(b) (1979), which provided for the admission of evidence obtained in good faith upon a warrant based on probable cause, was not effective on the date the seizure took place. In addition, the admission of a videotape of the complaining witness was not unconstitutional because she appeared in the trial court immediately after the tape was shown, and was cross-examined by appellant. Further, the trial court correctly instructed the jury that the state was not bound by the exact date set forth in the indictment, but could convict if they found that the offense occurred within five years preceding the return of the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the decision of the 71st Judicial District Court of Harrison County (Texas), which convicted him of theft.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was indicted for theft as a result of passing a worthless check in exchange for merchandise sold in a store. The charged offense, otherwise a misdemeanor, was upgraded to a third degree felony because of two prior convictions under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03(e)(4)(C) (1987), which punished a third theft offense as a felony regardless of the value of the property stolen. Appellant was found guilty and the jury enhanced his punishment to life imprisonment, because of the two prior felony convictions. Appellant contended that the state failed to allege and prove that his second felony conviction for manslaughter used to enhance his punishment was for an offense that occurred after the first felony was final. On appeal, the court held that while the state properly alleged that appellant's second felony conviction was for an offense that occurred after his first felony conviction was final, it failed to prove that allegation. As result, the court reversed and remanded appellant's conviction to the trial court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder. He challenged the conviction on several grounds. The court affirmed, first concluding that the district court did not err when it prevented appellant's counsel from questioning prospective jurors about their ability to recommend probation for an illegal alien because the question had no bearing on any issue in the case. Next, the court held that the district court did not err by admitting the written confession appellant gave following his warrantless arrest because the arrest was lawful. The court found that the arrest was lawful because the officers had satisfactory proof that a murder had been committed, that appellant committed it, and that appellant was likely to flee. Based on its finding that the arrest was lawful, the court also determined that counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the admission of the confession as the fruit of an illegal arrest. Further, the court determined that appellant waived his objection to the jury instruction on the issue of parole and his objection to the authority of the district judge to preside over the trial by failing to raise contemporaneous objections at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated robbery. Punishment was assessed at 50 years' confinement.

The judgment of the trial court was reversed based on appellant's point of error regarding the argument made by the prosecutor at the punishment phase of the trial. The court found the argument made by the prosecutor, which included a misstatement of law and a detailed explanation of the mechanics of parole eligibility, was reversible error as the argument was grossly improper and prejudicial.

Appellant sought review and the appellate court affirmed. Appellant's claimed error regarding a violation of Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

The appellate court further held that the indictment sufficiently alleged capital murder and did not mislead appellant. The appellate court also found that, because appellant listed multiple reasons under the same point of error regarding the inadmissibility of her confession under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.22, nothing was presented for review. However, addressing the claimed errors, the appellate court noted that appellant was not entitled to a warning under art. 38.22 because her confession was not made during custodial interrogation and that she had received a warning which complied with art. 38.22. Finally, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction. Although the accomplices testified against her, appellant's confession provided sufficient corroborating evidence to support her conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that art. 67011-(b) defined the crime of driving while intoxicated with sufficient specificity to pass constitutional muster. The court also held that the arresting officer's testimony that he observed appellant driving in an intoxicated state was sufficient to support the conviction. Further, the court found that the information was legally sufficient because it tracked the language of art. 67011-(b) and charged every element of the crime. The court also found that the jury instructions regarding the elements of the crime were proper as they tracked the language of art. 67011-(b) and the information.

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 25.06 for the purchase of a child, alleging that &sect; 25.06 was unconstitutionally vague, that the indictment and the jury should have been quashed, and that it was error to permit the state to introduce certain evidence. The court reversed the conviction, concluding that it was reversible error to admit the extraneous unadjudicated offense evidence. The court reasoned that appellant, in presenting three witnesses who testified only that he had never been convicted of a felony, did not mislead the jury or give a false impression to give the state a reason to introduce such unadjudicated offenses. The court found that while the statute may have been vague with respect to some conduct, it clearly prohibited appellant's conduct, so he had no standing to argue vagueness. It further found that appellant failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that the comment made by a potential juror who was later excused prejudiced his rights when the comment, while concerning the case, was made to the pool of potential jurors rather than to the jury itself.</SPAN></P>

Appellee Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Company declared the savings association insolvent and was appointed receiver. The trial court entered a default judgment against appellee. Appellants sought review of the trial court's decision to set aside the default judgment and dismiss appellants' cause of action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Appellee asserted that under 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1464(d)(6)(c), adjudication of appellants' claims would restrain or affect the exercise of appellee's receivership powers. The court determined that it was not bound by the decisions of the Fifth Circuit or by federal district courts; therefore, the court looked independently at the statutes, regulations, and legislative history for its determination. The court determined that appellee did not have the power to adjudicate claims.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his pretrial motions were denied, appellant pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana and delivery of marijuana and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. On appeal, the court rejected as moot appellant's claim that his motion to dismiss should have been granted on statutory speedy trial grounds because the Speedy Trial Act, Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

Although the grand jury did not prepare a memorandum before the indictment in accordance with Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both appellants, father and stepmother, challenged a decision from the 262nd District Court of Harris Count (Texas), which convicted them of bodily injury to a child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, father and stepmother, were indicted and pleaded not guilty to the charge of bodily injury to a child. The evidence showed that appellants subjected an 11 year-old girl to a series of severe beatings. The jury found them guilty, and the trial court sentenced them to 10 years' confinement and a fine. Appellants sought review, contending that the trial court erred in denying appellants the right to have a jury assess punishment and that the statute did not give them reasonable notice of the degree of conduct constituting serious bodily injury. On appeal, the court affirmed because it found that appellants' elections for jury punishment were not timely filed when they were not filed until after the jury was selected and both appellants had pleaded guilty. Also, the court found that the statute gave parents reasonable notice of the conditions that constituted bodily injury and that no reasonable person could believe that savage beatings were necessary for disciplinary purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions of bodily injury to a child were affirmed on the ground that the election made by appellants, father and stepmother, for jury punishment were untimely as they were filed after the jury was selected and both appellants had pleaded not guilty. Further, appellants could not have reasonably believed that the savage beatings they inflicted on the child were necessary for disciplinary purposes.</SPAN></P>
