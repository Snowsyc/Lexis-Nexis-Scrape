</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizen appealed from an order of the Supreme Court (New York), which entered judgment for defendant city in the citizen's action challenging the city's levy of real property tax of $ 73,923,246, including $ 23,327,290 for pension and retirement payments, upon the taxable real estate in the city. The trial court declared that N.Y. Local Fin. Law &sect; 11-42(a) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen contended that the tax imposed exceeded the proper tax levies by $ 17,707,313 because of the pension and retirement payments. The city argued that the benefits of the payments had useful periods beyond one year. The trial court had upheld N.Y. Local Fin. Law &sect; 11-42(a). The court reversed, finding that &sect; 11-42(a) was without a rational basis and was arbitrary. The cases relied on by the city were one-time fundings of obligations, not ongoing payments. All of the city's expenditures could be considered to have a usefulness outliving the fiscal year when they were made, which would render the constitutional restriction meaningless. The citizens of the state of New York, in establishing a constitutional tax limit of two percent for operating expenses, presumably decided that it was the maximum tax which could be levied on real property without becoming oppressive, and it could not be circumvented by legislation. The court did not order repayment, finding that the city administration had relied upon the statute in preparing its budget and to mandate repayment of amounts illegally collected in the past would place an impossible burden upon it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in favor of the city upholding the tax levy and entered a judgment in favor of the citizen.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- pensions -- constitutional limitation -- trial court erred in not declaring </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> section of Local Finance Law insofar as it excepts taxes on real property for city pension and retirement liabilities from tax total constitutionally required to be within percentage limit of formulated valuation of city's taxable real estate -- taxes already illegally collected need not be returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The trial court erred in not declaring unconstitutional as arbitrary and without rational basis paragraph 42-a of subdivision a of section 11.00 of the Local Finance Law insofar as it excepts the City of Buffalo's future annual requirement for pension and retirement liabilities from those taxes the total of which must not exceed the real property tax limit, as defined in section 10 of article VIII of the New York Constitution, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of 2% of the average full valuation of the city's taxable real estate. Subdivision (b) of section 11 of article VIII excepts those taxes, from such limit, levied for the payment of direct budgetary appropriations for purposes which have a period of probable usefulness determined by law.  Paragraph 42-a, by declaratory description, categorizes the pension and retirement liabilities so as to comply with the constitutional exception; if such statute were valid, most periodic city expenditures could be similarly excepted and the constitutional limitation rendered meaningless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The city need not repay the tax moneys illegally collected and already spent in reliance upon the statute; such mandate would place an impossible burden on the city and, as a doctrine, would inhibit implementation of statutes until tested by the courts.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant electors sought review of the judgment of the Supreme Court (New York) which denied the electors' petition to rescind and annul the actions of respondent town board in creating a water district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A referendum was held on the town board's proposal to create a water district that included the entire township. All qualified electors were permitted to vote, not just the owners of taxable real property. After the proposition was approved, some of the electors filed a petition to rescind and annul the actions of the town board. The trial court denied the petition. On appeal, the court modified the trial court's judgment, but otherwise affirmed it. First, the court held that N.Y. Town Law &sect; 209-e(3), which limited the franchise to the owners of taxable real property, was unconstitutional, except upon a showing that nonowners of property were substantially less interested than property owners in the outcome of the referendum and that the exclusion of nonproperty owners was necessary to promote a compelling state interest. Those challenging the referendum failed to make that showing. Next, the court held that the town board did not abuse its legislative power and discretion in its creation of the water district's boundary lines. The court modified the judgment only insofar as the trial court determined that the electors' challenge to the benefit method of assessment was premature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment dismissing the electors' petition to rescind and annul the actions of the town board in creating a water district, except that the judgment was modified insofar as the trial court determined that the electors' challenge to the benefit method of assessment was premature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- water district -- not only &quot;owners of taxable real property&quot; ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Town Law, &sect; 209-e</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 3), but all qualified residents, are constitutionally entitled to vote on creation of proposed water district -- Town Board properly determined that water district's boundaries should be same as town's, and that costs of district should be assessed on properties according to benefits received -- actual assessment amounts have not yet been determined and hence cannot be reviewed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Despite the provision in the Town Law ( &sect; 209-e, subd. 3) that the voters on a proposition for the creation of a water district shall be &quot;the owners of taxable real property situate in the proposed district&quot;, qualified resident electors who do not own real property are constitutionally&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  entitled to vote too.  They are not substantially less interested, and there is no compelling State interest or reason for excluding them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. After a public hearing, the Town Board properly determined that all property within the town would be benefited by the creation of a water district and that therefore the district's boundaries should be the same as the town's boundaries.  Such determination was legislative and discretionary and the court will not reverse it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Town Board further properly determined that the costs of the district should be assessed, not according to the assessed valuations of real properties, but according to the benefits received by the different real properties ( Town Law, &sect; 209-q, subd. 6, pars.  [c], [e]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. However, the Town Board has not levied or determined any assessment amounts yet, and it is not bound by the schedule of assessments suggested in the report of its consulting engineers; so any attack on assessment amounts is, as yet, premature (cf.  Town Law, &sect;&sect; 236, 237, 239; &sect; 209-q, subd. 6, par.  [e]).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant town sought review of an order of the Supreme Court of Erie County (New York), which granted respondent property owner's motion for summary judgment in the property owner's action challenging a local law as violative of the state constitution and N.Y. Town Law &sect; 130(16).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town's building inspector determined that two residential buildings of the property owner were unfit, unsafe, and a menace to public health, welfare, and safety. Pursuant to the provisions of local law, he notified the property owner by certified mail that the structures had to be repaired, removed, or demolished. The inspector posted a similar notice on the structures. The mailed notice came back through the mail, and the inspector handed a copy to the property owner's husband when he came to the inspector's office to discuss the matter. At the meeting, the inspector told the husband that he had six months to make repairs. Without further notice or contact, the buildings were demolished. The property owner asserted that she had made improvements to the premises after the service of the notice and had brought the buildings into compliance. The court upheld the judgment granted to the property owner, finding that the local law was unconstitutional. The law was inconsistent with N.Y. Town Law &sect; 130(16) because it failed to require an application for an order granting permission to demolish the structures. Therefore, the local law was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order granting the property owner's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York State Constitution (art. IX, &sect; 2, subd. [c], subpar. [ii], cl. [10]) allows local governments to adopt laws pertaining to the protection, order, conduct, safety, health and well-being of persons or property therein &quot;not inconsistent with the provisions of * * * any general law&quot;.  The Municipal Home Rule Law ( &sect; 10, subd. 1, par. [ii], subpar. a, cl. [11]) gives local governments the same power.  The Town Law ( &sect; 130, subd. 16) lays out specific provisions for legislation for the repair or removal of buildings.  Local Law No. 1 of the Town of Evans does not meet the standards of the Town Law ( &sect; 130, subd. 16).  The most apparent defects are: defective notice requirements; failure to require the inspector, when designating an unfit building, to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  make a report; failure to provide for a survey; failure to provide for a motion at Special Term prior to the destruction of buildings and the provision that assessments be made against the owner or occupant of the premises rather than against the land.  Local Law No.  1 is invalid. </SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding for a declaratory judgment that New York State's present bail system violated the rights guaranteed them by the U.S. Constitution and the laws of New York State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves as criminal defendants and as a class action, sought a declaratory judgment that the bail system for those facing criminal charges in New York County violated the equal protection and due process clauses of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the Eighth Amendment and federal constitutional prohibitions against excessive bail. Specifically, plaintiffs argued that the bail system was unfair because it denied poor people their freedom pending a trial and that the denial of bail inevitably led to conviction. The court found that there was no proper basis for a class action because there were individual determinations made in every bail application and denied the relief requested. The court further found that it was not because bail was required that a criminal defendant was later convicted, but because he was likely to be convicted that bail was required. The court granted judgment declaring that the bail system was constitutional, that there was no basis for a class action, and dismissed the petition seeking to prohibit the present system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was granted declaring New York's bail system constitutional because bail system had a rational relationship to and was adjusted to a criminal defendant's circumstances, and there were procedures for judicial review of bail determinations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since every bail determination is individual, and furthermore can be judicially reviewed ( CPL 460.50; CPLR 7002), there is no basis for a class action or class proceeding ( CPLR 1005, subd. [a]).  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioners pleaded guilty to count three of a four-count Federal indictment, arising from robbery of a national bank and taking the manager as hostage, charging petitioners with forcible accompaniment without consent in violation of subdivision (e) of section 2113 of title 18 of the United States Code.  The other counts were dismissed.  Subdivision (e) of the Federal statute provides that &quot;Whoever, in committing any offense defined in this section * * * forces any person to accompany him without the consent of such person, shall be imprisoned&quot;.  While such subdivision&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  does not explicitly define the crime therein as kidnapping, it nonetheless spells out kidnapping within the purview of the Federal bank robbery statute.  Prosecution under an indictment against petitioners handed down by the Richmond County Grand Jury charging kidnapping in the first and second degrees is prohibited.  The Federal indictment included the charge of kidnapping which is the gravamen of the State indictment. The charges are essentially the same.

The property owners challenged the enactment of a city ordinance changing the zoning for the area on the ground that it was simply a reenactment of an ordinance already declared invalid. The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court, holding that the ordinance was valid. The court found that because the previous ordinance was held invalid, it did not prevent a subsequent rezoning if it was based on a comprehensive plan rather than spot zoning. A change in zoning would be upheld if it did not conflict with the community's basic scheme of land use. The ordinance at issue was an attempt to zone the entire city. Moreover, the change in zoning by permitting the construction of a supermarket was not in conflict with the city's comprehensive plan. The court rejected the property owner's argument that they had no notice of the public hearings concerning the reenactment, finding that although N.Y. Gen. City Law &sect; 83 did not require the city to publish the notice in the newspaper, the city published the notice of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- enactment after sufficient notice of comprehensive, citywide zoning ordinance, rationally conceived with consideration of community's land use problems, which changed 13-lot area in City of Yonkers into district permitting supermarket and accessory parking use, which was in harmony with surrounding neighborhood, was proper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1953, an ordinance of the City of Yonkers zoned 1 through 4 of 13 contiguous lots on Riverdale Avenue near the New York City line as &quot;BA&quot; commercial, changing the rest to A-1 residential. Attempts by successive&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  owners to obtain city permission to build a supermarket on lots 1 through 4 plus a part of 5 and to use the remaining lots for accessory parking were either denied at the Zoning Board of Appeals or city Common Council levels or struck down in the courts, once under an article 78 proceeding establishing no right to a variance based upon a hardship self-imposed by knowingly purchasing the lots for a prohibited use, and again in a suit for a declaratory judgment determining that a 1962 ordinance specifying lots 5 through 13 for use only for accessory parking was spot zoning not adopted pursuant to a comprehensive plan. In 1970, the Yonkers Common Council re-enacted (G.O. No. 39-1970) a 1968 citywide, comprehensive zoning ordinance (G.O. No. 24-1968) which, among other changes, put all 13 lots into a &quot;B&quot; zone district permitting supermarket and accessory parking use.  The re-enacted ordinance was properly upheld by the trial court as applied to these 13 lots because the over-all comprehensive plan was rationally created with forethought to the community's land use problems; the change was not antagonistic to the city's comprehensive zoning plan and was in harmony with the surrounding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  neighborhood; procedurally, the 1970 ordinance was enacted after sufficient notice, and any issue as to whether the ordinance is void because it adopts by reference penal provisions is not before the court as no attempt has been made to enforce such provisions, if any exist, and the contention was not raised at Special Term.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant employee challenged a decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board (New York) that sustained respondent commissioner's determination that the employee was not entitled to benefits because he lost his job as a federal postal inspector through misconduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While still a probationary employee of the United States Post Office, the employee was terminated, and he filed a claim for unemployment benefits. On a wage and separation information form, the federal agency reported that the termination was the result of the employee's having been apprehended for theft of mail even though the indictment against him had been dismissed. As a result of this information, the commissioner denied the employee's request for benefits based on misconduct, and although a referee reversed that decision, it was affirmed by an appellate board. On appeal, the court reversed the decision of the appellate board, holding that the finding of misconduct was not supported by substantial evidence and that the federal agency had not found the employee guilty of mail fraud. The court found that no substantial evidence was submitted to show that the employee had stolen the mail; thus, the appellate board was not entitled to draw the factual conclusion from the literal language of the federal agency's report that the employee had actually stolen mail. The court concluded that the employee did not lose his employment because of misconduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate board's finding that the employee had been discharged for misconduct and was therefore not entitled to unemployment compensation benefits.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Federal postal clerk, discharged before the end of his six-month probationary term &quot;for being apprehended by a postal inspector for theft of mail&quot; and because &quot;Termination during probation 5/19/71 for being apprehended by the postal inspection service for the theft of mail on 5/3/71&quot;, was improperly denied unemployment insurance benefits by the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board.  The Federal agency's report states that claimant was apprehended for mail theft but does not by implication or otherwise constitute substantial evidence to infer that claimant had been found by the agency or his superiors to have actually stolen mail. The report establishes that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  claimant was charged with a theft of mail and for that reason, without coming to any conclusions as to guilt or innocence, the agency terminated the employment of the probationary employee. Being charged with an act which would constitute misconduct would not support a disqualification from benefits without a finding that the employee was guilty of misconduct, and here there is no evidence to support a finding of guilt of mail theft or of misconduct. </SPAN></P>

The Commission contended that the corporation was required to exhaust its time-barred administrative remedy provided for in N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1138. Affirming the order of the lower court, the court held that where when a taxing authority's jurisdiction was challenged on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional or inapplicable, resort need not be had to the method of review prescribed in the taxing statute. The court found that the corporation contended that its activities were outside the scope of the sales tax and sought to prohibit the Commission from exceeding its jurisdiction by applying the sales tax law to the corporation's operation. Accordingly, the administrative remedy provided for in &sect; 1138 was clearly inadequate for such purpose. The court concluded that the corporation could have properly maintained the N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant filed for admission to the state bar after the Committee on Character and Fitness reported that he possessed the requisite character and fitness for an attorney at law notwithstanding that admission of the applicant to being a homosexual and having engaged in homosexual acts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant, certified as having passed the bar examination, filed for admission to the bar. The court denied his application finding that he lacked the requisite character and fitness to be admitted to the bar. The Supreme Court of Florida disbarred the applicant after he was found guilty of behavior contrary to good morals and in violation of Florida law. The applicant had been accused of committing sodomy on a public beach. He had been arrested previously for the offense, had given a bail bond, and thereafter forfeited it. The applicant maintained his innocence of the charges. On independent view of the record, the court found that the evidence substantiated the findings of fact. The evidence raised issues of credibility and the referee in the Florida disbarment proceeding was entitled to decide those issues against the applicant. The court found that so long as N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 130.38 was in effect, homosexuality, which, in its fulfillment, usually entailed commission of a statutorily proscribed act, was a factor which could militate against the eligibility of an applicant for admission to the bar who proposed to pursue his way of life in disregard of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the application for admission to the bar after the applicant had been disbarred in Florida after he was found guilty of behavior contrary to good morals in violation of Florida law following his arrest for committing sodomy on a public beach at night.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attorneys -- admission to Bar -- application for admission to Bar of this State by one who had been disbarred in Florida upon findings that he had committed sodomy denied -- disbarment in Florida does not foreclose exercise of judgment by New York courts -- New York not bound to give full faith and credit to Florida disbarment -- under New York law applicant would have been automatically disbarred -- initial admission may not be granted where he could not have been readmitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Peters</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (250 N. Y. 595) and the Judiciary Law ( &sect; 90, subd. 5) do not foreclose the exercise of judgment by the New York courts in determining character and fitness of an applicant for admission to the Bar of this State, regardless of his disbarment in Florida.  The fact of disbarment and the charges underlying the disbarment must be considered together with all the other circumstances, so that the total background of the applicant may be viewed to determine his character and fitness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. New York is not bound to give full faith and credit to the Florida judgment of disbarment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Findings of fact in Florida that the applicant had committed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sodomy were substantiated by the evidence, although the applicant continues to maintain his innocence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The decision referred to by the applicant, who maintains that the statute under which he was arrested in 1955 was held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Florida, did not affect his conviction and subsequent disbarment, but, instead, ratified it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Moreover, in 1955, at the time of the incident leading to the applicant's conviction, sodomy, even between consenting adults, was a felony in New York (former Penal Law, &sect; 690).  Accordingly, under our then laws, if the applicant had been an attorney in our State, he would have been automatically disbarred and he could not be readmitted except upon a reversal of the conviction or a pardon (Judiciary Law, &sect; 90, subd. 5).  If he could not have been readmitted, initial admission may not be granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The fact that at present the applicant's act would be considered a misdemeanor in Florida and would also be considered a class B misdemeanor under section 130.38 of our Penal Law does not affect the validity or propriety of the Florida disbarment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The applicant did not produce any evidence in support of his contention before&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the committee that he was a victim of entrapment in the incident upon which his disbarment was based; nor did he make that contention at any time in the proceedings in Florida.  There is nothing to indicate that the applicant was not granted a fair and full hearing in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. There is no need to reach the question whether, as petitioner contends, the moral climate toward homosexuality has so changed since 1957 that his disbarment on that ground should not deter his admission to the Bar here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The applicant lacks the requisite character and fitness to be admitted to the Bar in this State and his application should be denied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner developers filed proceedings under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 to annul determinations by respondent Board of Standards and Appeals of the City of New York (board), which denied applications by the developers for extensions of permits for the construction of apartment buildings that had been challenged by the intervenor individuals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developers were the last in a series of parties who were trying to construct a high rise apartment building over a railroad right of way in the face of vigorous opposition by the individuals. The board had granted numerous extensions over the course of several years, when it changed its opinion and denied the developers permit for further extensions. In a proceeding for extraordinary relief the court held that: (1) the operative zoning regulations had not restricted the transfer of permits or property, (2) formal acknowledgment of judicial concepts such as the res judicata doctrine was not necessary in the administrative circumstance under consideration, but due regard for principled decisions made in the past that concerned the same project was desirable, (3) the developers had acquired a vested right in the project under consideration by virtue of the combined force of prior determinations by the board and the expenditures and liabilities of the developers made in reliance on those determinations that could not be set aside.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the determination of the board, which had denied an extension, should be annulled and the board was directed to issue an extension of the requested permits for one year from the date of the court's order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- building permits -- after city Board of Standards and Appeals granted seven extensions of building permits for construction of large apartment buildings over railroad right of way over period of 10 years and after petitioners acquired ownership, city agreeing to alter last building permit to show petitioners' changes in plans, board denied eighth renewal; denial is annulled and respondent directed to issue permit -- petitioners did not need possessory interest -- in face of prior extensions and petitioners' expenditures and reliance on prior permits, board</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> improperly exercised discretion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In 1961, the Long Island Railroad sold part of its right of way for the construction of apartment houses over the right of way, the railroad retaining a perpetual easement over the property for railroad purposes.  A new zoning resolution became effective on December 15, 1961, which permitted apartment houses but at a lesser scale.  The purchaser obtained building permits for construction of the apartment houses as originally contemplated.  Work started on the project but had not been completed.  Extensions of the permits were granted for two years.  One-year additional extensions were granted until 1967, when the builder defaulted and a bank holding a mortgage became the owner at a foreclosure sale.  The bank obtained four additional one-year extensions and in April, 1971 contracted to sell the property to petitioners.  Petitioners changed the plans and the building permit was amended accordingly.  On December 10, 1971 they applied for an additional year's extension which the Board of Standards and Appeals denied.  Such denial is annulled and the applications should be granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The 1960 Zoning Resolution did not require a possessory interest&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and it did not prohibit the transfer of building permits or of the property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The board granted a series of seven applications for extensions to build, the last four having been made by a bank which was seeking a builder with the means and ability to undertake a construction of considerable size.  When the bank succeeded in finding a builder, the board reversed its prior rulings, all of which had been sustained by the courts, and determined that the development was not appropriate and that work on the foundations had not been substantially completed.  The exercise of discretion by the board in denying the present extension cannot be disassociated from its exercise of discretion in granting past extensions.  While the board could take into account the long delay in completing the construction, it could not ignore its own determinations to condone the delay and its own findings of substantial construction and appropriateness of the property for the relief granted.  The exercise of discretion in refusing another extension is beyond justification in the face of petitioners' large expenditures and their contracting of liabilities, on the strength of the extensions, after they had purchased&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the property.  Petitioners acquired a vested right to proceed under their permits in the light of the combined force of the prior determination of the board, upheld by the courts, the expenditures made in reliance on the permits prior to the time petitioners purchased the property, and the expenditures and the assumption of contractual liabilities of petitioners in reliance on the permits subsequent to their purchase of the property.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state employees and respondent state officials appealed an order of the Supreme Court at Special Term in Albany County (New York), which granted the state officials' motion to dismiss the state employees' petition on behalf of all others similarly situated and denied the state officials' motion to dismiss the petition in all other respects. The state employees had filed an action against the state officials to annul a determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state employees received a notice from one of the state officials that they had engaged in a strike in violation of N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 210. Thereafter, the state employees filed affidavits that contained a statement of facts to show that they had not engaged in the strike. The state employees also commenced proceedings for a judgment annulling the determination that they were in the strike and for a judgment declaring &sect;&sect; 210(1), 210(2)(b), (d), (e), (f), (h)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The state officials responded by filing a motion to dismiss the petitions. The trial court in part granted the state officials' motion. The court modified the trial court's order and, as modified, affirmed the trial court's order. The court held that due process did not require that an employee should have been granted a hearing on his objections prior to the imposition of penalties under &sect; 210(2)(f), (g) in all actions that involved strikes by public employees, as the procedures outlined under &sect; 210 constituted sufficient due process. The prevention of strikes by public employees involved a &quot;valid governmental interest&quot; that justified the procedure for imposing penalties prior to a hearing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Due process does not require that an employee should be granted a hearing on his objections prior to the imposition of the penalties prescribed by the Civil Service Law ( &sect; 210, subd 2, pars. [f], [g]) in cases involving strikes by public employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The contention that the penalty provisions of section 210 are unconstitutional and that such provisions operate as a bill of attainder is without merit.  The statutory procedures constitute sufficient due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. While the penalties provided by the statute, both as to loss of tenure and loss of pay, affect property rights of the employee, the public interest involved justifies the procedure which permits imposition of penalties prior to a hearing on the determination by the chief executive&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  officer that the public employee had engaged in a strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Legislation which differentiates between strikes by public employees and employees in private industry is reasonable and does not offend against the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In the proceedings involving petitioners Sanford, Winkowski and Splatt, the motions to dismiss their petition, on the ground that they have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, should be granted.  After the hearings which they have been granted, it may be determined that their objections will be sustained, which would preclude any further review by them and, therefore, these proceedings for review are premature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. However, in the proceeding involving petitioner Godbee, since his objection was denied and it was determined that he was not entitled to a hearing, that determination is subject to review in this article 78 proceeding.  The Godbee proceeding should be remitted to Special Term for a determination as to the sufficiency of the objections filed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The State employees affected by the notices issued by the Director of the Office of Employee Relations fall into three groups: (1) those who filed objections&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and were granted a hearing; (2) those who filed objections and were denied a hearing; and (3) those who failed to file objections.  Special Term properly determined that a class action was not appropriate because different questions were involved as to each employee and determination of the merits of each objection would turn on the particular facts and circumstances involved.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator's intestate was born out of wedlock. Her mother died about 11 years later. According to the administrator, he and his wife reared his intestate from the time that she was seven days old until she was placed in a foster home just before her death. The intestate died as the result of injuries suffered in a car accident. The car was operated by the owner's intestate. The administrator claimed that he was the father, and he was entitled to pursue damages for his intestate's wrongful death, even though he had not obtained an order of filiation declaring him to be the father. The owner, in support of her motion to dismiss the wrongful death cause, contended that there were no distributees surviving the administrator's intestate and, therefore, pursuant to N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 5-4.1, an action for wrongful death could not be maintained. On appeal, the court held the administrator established his paternity of the intestate by open and complete acknowledgment. The court then found that denial of the motion to dismiss was warranted because the administrator was entitled to treatment as a distributee for the purpose of maintaining the cause of action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of an order of the County Court of Albany County (New York) that granted defendants' motion to dismiss indictments accusing defendants of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree, violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 175.35, and grand larceny in the second degree, violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 175.35.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges arose out of an investigation into snow removal contracts between defendants and a city. As part of the investigation, defendants signed a waiver of immunity, under N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 103-b, and testified before the grand jury. In their motion to dismiss, defendants argued that &sect; 103-b, which required contractors to waive immunity in investigations involving public contracts or lose the right to bid on future contracts for five years, was unconstitutional because it denied them their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The court rejected the argument, and reversed the dismissal of the indictments. In so ruling, the court held that &sect; 103-b merely placed a special duty on contractors who applied for public contracts due to the trust placed in them in relation to public funds. The court explained that defendants consented to the provisions of &sect; 103-b, and encumbered their Fifth Amendment privilege, at a time when the choice was unfettered. Consequently, the court found that defendants had not been coerced into testifying. Moreover, the court found that &sect; 103-b was a valid exercise of police power, which did not unduly impinge upon a contractor's rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant administrator sought review of a decision of the Supreme Court at Special Term in New York County (New York), which refused to commit appellee mental patient to a state hospital for the criminally insane pursuant to N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mental patient was a civilly committed indigent patient in a state hospital. After several violent outbursts resulting in injuries to others, the administrator of the state hospital initiated proceedings, pursuant to &sect; 85, to have the mental patient declared dangerously mentally ill and transferred to a state hospital for the criminally insane run by the department of corrections. The trial court found the mental patient dangerously mentally ill but refused to transfer the mental patient on the grounds that commitment in the hospital for the criminally insane would violate the mental patient's right to due process and equal protection. On appeal by the administrator, the court reversed the trial court's refusal to commit the mental patient and found that commitment of the mental patient was constitutional because has was afforded due process as to the determination that he was dangerously mentally ill and as to the right to receive periodic review of his status. The classification of mentally ill persons as either insane or dangerously insane was a reasonable distinction for the purposes of determining the type of custodial or medical care to be given.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 85 of the Mental Hygiene Law provides for the mandatory transfer of a civilly committed patient in a State hospital to Matteawan State Hospital following a determination that he is dangerously mentally ill. Petitioner, director of Manhattan State Hospital, made an application pursuant to the Mental Hygiene Law ( &sect; 85, subd. 1) for an examination of respondent, an involuntary civil mentally ill patient at Manhattan State Hospital, by two examining physicians, alleging that respondent was dangerously mentally ill. The two examing physicians certified that he was &quot;so dangerously mentally ill that (his) presence in a hospital in the Department of Mental Hygiene is dangerous to the safety of other patients therein, the officers or employees thereof, or to the community.&quot; A hearing was held and respondent was represented by counsel at the hearing.  Special Term found that respondent was dangerously mentally ill within the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  meaning of the statute but denied the petitioner's application.  This was error and the application for commitment of the respondent should be granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The requirement of the Mental Hygiene Law ( &sect; 85, subd. 4) that, upon a finding that a patient is dangerously mentally ill, &quot;the judge shall forthwith issue his order hospitalizing him in the Matteawan state hospital for a period not to exceed six months from the date of such order&quot; does not deny respondent the constitutional right of either equal protection of the laws or due process of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Supreme Court of the United States in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Baxstrom </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Herold</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (383 U.S. 107) tacitly approved the procedure prescribed by section 85 of the Mental Hygiene Law and recognized that commitment thereunder to Matteawan State Hospital is constitutional where an indigent person, entitled to civil status, is dangerously mentally ill and is afforded procedural due process as to the determination that he is dangerously mentally ill and the right to periodic review of his status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Respondent was afforded all of the procedural due process required for commitment under section 85 of the Mental Hygiene Law. Undoubtedly, respondent would have&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  been entitled to a jury trial of the issues presented but he did not request a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. There is no significance in the omission of the word &quot;treatment&quot; in the mandate to the Department of Correction ( Correction Law, &sect; 400, subd. 1) to maintain hospitals for the mentally ill &quot;solely for the purpose of holding in custody and caring for such mentally ill persons&quot;.  The word &quot;care&quot; includes and imports the &quot;treatment&quot; of such persons.  Moreover, Matteawan State Hospital is adequately staffed to provide the necessary treatment and care commensurate with the needs of civil patients transferred there pursuant to section 85 of the Mental Hygiene Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. While there are differences in the internal operation of hospitals under the jurisdiction of the Departments of Correction and Mental Hygiene, the more restrictive regulations governing the former are proper and warranted by the need to protect ordinary civil mental patients from others in the same class who are dangerously mentally ill. The difference in regulations does not constitute a denial of equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. There is no merit in the argument that the proportion of patients in State hospitals who are poor and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  disadvantaged is higher than in other types of mental hospitals, that transfers under section 85 necessarily fall with greater impact on the poor, and that this constitutes a denial of equal protection of the laws.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 160.15(4) was unconstitutional because it created a presumption of guilt and thus would compel him to be a witness against himself. In affirming, the court held that defendant's argument failed because placing the burden of proof on defendant as to a fact peculiarly within his knowledge did not deny him the benefit of the presumption of innocence. The court found that the state still had to establish every element of the substantive crime and defendant was offered the opportunity to assert an affirmative defense, but was not forced to do so. Therefore, defendant was not compelled to a witness against himself.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment from the trial court that convicted defendant of robbery in the first degree and grand larceny in the third degree.</SPAN></P>

[b]); rather, defendant can offer no evidence, or evidence of others that he is innocent or that no gun was used or that gun was unloaded or inoperable; nor need his defenses be consistent with each other; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> is constitutional -- trial court should not have permitted People's witness, detective, to remain in courtroom while other witnesses testified; however, defendant was not prejudiced thereby -- trial court should not have spoken on telephone with prospective defense witness without knowledge of defense counsel;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> however, in context, this error was not sufficient for reversal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Penal Law provides (&sect; 160.10): &quot;A person is guilty of robbery in the second degree when he forcibly steals property and when * * * 2.  In the course of the commission of the crime or of immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime * * * (b) Displays what appears to be a pistol, revolver or other firearm.&quot; However, on the same proof, he is guilty of robbery in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">first degree</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Penal Law, &sect; 160.15, subd. 4); &quot;except that in any prosecution under this subdivision [4], it is an affirmative defense that such pistol, revolver or other firearm was not a loaded weapon * * * capable of producing * * * serious physical injury&quot;.  When the defendant raises such affirmative defense &quot;at a trial,&quot; he &quot;has the burden of establishing such defense by a preponderance of the evidence&quot; (Penal Law, &sect; 25.00, subd. 2).  Here, the People's case established that the defendant displayed a gun and thus robbed the complainant.  The People could not actually produce the gun. Thereupon the defendant took the stand and denied any robbery and any gun. The jury properly found him guilty, as charged, of robbery&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the first degree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Subdivision 4 of section 160.15 of the Penal Law does not unconstitutionally compel a defendant who is charged with first degree robbery to incriminate himself of second degree robbery. After the People have proved that the defendant committed a robbery with a gun, the defendant can choose whether or not to offer any evidence.  If he chooses, he can testify or he can offer the evidence of others that he is innocent, or that the gun was unloaded or inoperable, or that he has other defenses.  Nor need his defenses be consistent with each other.  The situation does not compel him to incriminate himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Witnesses should be excluded from the courtroom while other witnesses are testifying, particularly where the testimony is in any measure corroborative or cumulative.  Thus, it is regrettable that the trial court permitted one of the People's witnesses, a detective, to remain in the courtroom to assist the prosecution throughout the trial.  However, it is not shown that defendant was prejudiced thereby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. During a recess, the trial court spoke on the telephone with a prospective defense witness about his possible testimony, without the knowledge of defense&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  counsel. This was injudicious, but, in the context of this jury trial, it was not reversible error. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, operators of an unlicensed abortion clinic, sought review of an order of the Supreme Court, Westchester County (New York), which, in an action for a permanent injunction pursuant to N.Y. Pub. Health Law art. 28, granted the motion of plaintiff, State of New York (people), for a temporary injunction enjoining the operators from operating their clinic.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The people sought to temporarily enjoin the operation of an unlicensed abortion clinic, which relief the supreme court granted pending a trial on the action for a permanent injunction. The court reversed the injunction, finding that such relief should not have been granted because there was doubt as to the ultimate right to the relief sought. The court found that the people had no right to the temporary injunction because it had not shown that the operation of the clinic reasonably might result in injury to any person, as required by N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2801-b, nor was it clear that the clinic required a license under N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 10, &sect; 700.2(a)(6). Thus, the court concluded that the order constituted an improvident exercise of discretion because temporary injunctions which, in effect, granted the same relief to be expected by final judgment should only be granted with great caution and only when required by urgent situations, and then only upon clear evidence. Furthermore, the court found that the injunction granted exceeded the scope of N.Y. Pub.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action challenging the constitutionality of N.Y. Town Law &sect;&sect; 300-309, which provided that adjoining landowners were jointly responsible to install and maintain fences, plaintiff landowners appealed the judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term, Herkimer County (New York), which denied cross-motions for summary judgment filed by the landowners and by defendant dairy farm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners shared a common boundary with the dairy farm, but had no cattle of their own and no desire or need for a fence. The trial court refused to determine the matter without a trial. On appeal, the court found that the matter was a question of law only and so was amenable to summary judgment. The court noted a strong presumption of validity to legislation, but also noted that a statute whose effect was to curtail the liberty of persons and whose justification was claimed to lie in the exercise of the police power of the state had to bear a reasonable relationship to the alleged public good. While the statute might have served a valid public interest when it was first enacted in 1788, it was now arbitrary and confiscatory under some circumstances. The court held that the statutes acted to deprive the landowners of their property because they would be compelled to erect and maintain at their own expense fences that they neither needed nor wanted. The statutes were, therefore, unconstitutional insofar as they applied to the subject property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, which denied the landowners' motion for summary judgment, and granted judgment in favor of the landowners.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 300 of the Town Law provides in part that: &quot;Each owner of two adjoining tracts of land, except when they otherwise agree, shall make and maintain a just and equitable portion of the division fence between such lands, unless both of said adjoining owners shall agree to let their lands lie open, along the division line, to the use of all animals which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  may be lawfully upon the lands of either&quot;.  Section 303 provides that any dispute between adjoining owners shall be settled by two fence viewers of the town.  Section 305 provides that any party who refuses to erect or maintain a division fence shall be liable for the expense in making or repairing the fence. Sections 300 through 309 of the Town Law insofar as they apply to plaintiffs' property are unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. There is no question of fact and under these circumstances summary judgment is proper.  These statutes would deprive plaintiffs of their property, since they would be compelled to erect and maintain at their own expense fences which they neither need nor want.  Requiring an adjoining owner, under the circumstances in this case, who does not keep livestock, to share the cost of the fence for the benefit of his neighbor is not reasonably necessary to any legitimate public purpose and is oppressive. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner County of Orange and petitioner Public Service Commission of the State of New York (commission) brought proceedings under N.Y. Pub. Serv.

Law &sect;&sect; 120-130, to construct an electric transmission line, which was allowed and contested by petitioners. The court dismissed the petitions on the merits and confirmed the opinions and orders without costs. The court held that the notice provisions of art. 7 were constitutionally adequate, so property owners were afforded a sufficient opportunity for judicial review of the finding of need for a line. The court concluded that there was no merit to petitioners' contentions. The court found substantial evidence supported the commissions' findings of a need for the line and that the route was the most desirable under the relevant factors. The court found substantial evidence supported finding that it was appropriate to construct the line above ground, and the decision to approve this line was not arbitrary or unreasonable. The court found no merit to petitioner's assertion that art. 7 violated the home rule provision of N.Y. Const. art. IX by authorizing the commission to override local laws and regulations. The court found no denial of notice and the opportunity to be heard under that constitution's eminent domain provisions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a proceeding to review a determination of the Public Service Commission (PSC) made under article 7 of the Public Service Law (L. 1970, ch. 272; &sect;&sect; 120 through 130) granting a certificate of environmental compatibility and public need for the siting of a certain north-south transmission line, there is ample proof that the need is great and pressing and that the route approved is the most desirable one.  Substantial evidence also supports the finding that it would be best to build the line aboveground, and such finding is not arbitrary or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The determination to certify the north-south leg and continue the proceedings with respect to the east-west leg is within the power of the PSC since section 126 broadly authorizes it to grant the application for certification &quot;as filed or * * * upon such terms, conditions, limitations or modifications of the construction * * * of the facility&quot; as it deems appropriate.  There is proof of the reasonableness&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and propriety of that determination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Article 7 does not contravene the home rule provisions in article 9 of the State Constitution insofar as it authorizes the PSC to override local laws and regulations which it finds &quot;unreasonably restrictive&quot; (&sect; 126, subd. 1, par. [b]) with respect to the location of major transmission facilities.  Both article IX of the State Constitution and section 11 of the Statute of Local Governments have reserved to the State Legislature the power to enact general laws relating to matters of substantial State concern, even though they may be intermingled with matters of local concern, and article 7 of the Public Service Law is a general law relating to matters of substantial State concern.  In this case PSC's exercise of its statutory power to override unreasonably restrictive local laws and regulations adequately conformed to the requirements of section 126 (subd. 1, par. [f]) of the Public Service Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Article 7 of the Public Service Law, read with section 4 of the Condemnation Law, does not unconstitutionally deprive property owners of adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard on the issue of need for the taking of their property for a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  utility transmission line. Notice to State Senators and Assemblymen from the affected areas, and to the executive officers of the counties, towns and villages in the affected area, to interested State departments, and to property owners by publication in newspapers in the affected area is adequate to satisfy the requirements of due process.  Moreover, the actual location of the transmission line cannot be known until the PSC decides which of various proposed routes should be approved.  Therefore at the time the hearings are scheduled, the parties whose land will eventually be taken are unknown and it is unreasonable to hold that they are entitled to due process notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The question of need for a taking is for the Legislature, not the courts.  The courts cannot review such legislative determination and therefore notice and a hearing on that question are not essential to due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Property owners were not deprived of any constitutional right when in 1970 the Legislature took away their previous statutory right to litigate, in the condemnation proceeding, the question of need for a taking for a utility transmission line. A court review of the finding of need is accorded by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  an article 7 proceeding such as this one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Assuming that the notice accorded under article 7 is constitutionally inadequate, a property owner would still be able to institute an action for an injunction and a declaratory judgment to bar the taking of his property on the ground that the finding of need was corrupt or irrational.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The orders of the PSC should be confirmed and the petitions dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the County Court, Nassau County (New York), which convicted defendant, on a plea of guilty, of criminally selling a dangerous drug in the fourth degree and sentenced her to an indeterminate term of three years; and, from a judgment of the Supreme Court at Special in Nassau County (New York), which dismissed defendant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question before the court was whether on sentencing the trial court had to impose a prison term on a narcotic addict without considering the other alternatives open in cases of other offenders, simply because the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission (NACC), for reasons arising out of its own internal management, would not at the time accept involuntary criminal certifications of addicts. The court reversed defendant's sentence and held that imprisonment was not the only course that the sentencing court had to follow and that the usual sentencing options provided by law were available. When the NACC was forced by financial pressures to refrain from carrying out the manifest and salutary intent of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 60.15, then &sect; 60.15 had to be construed to authorize the court to apply any of the sentencing options which were appropriate under the circumstances to the convicted addict. There was no reason of constitutional stature that could justify difference in treatment of persons of similar standing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A prisoner who was convicted in Bronx County brought a habeas corpus proceeding in Wyoming County, alleging that his conviction was unconstitutional. The Wyoming County Court ordered Bronx County to conduct a hearing. The district attorney applied for a writ of prohibition against Wyoming County and the court denied the application. The court held that the writ of prohibition was inappropriate because the district attorney had an adequate remedy at law and equity: an appeal of the habeas proceeding. Failing to appeal did not make the writ of prohibition appropriate. When more than six months had elapsed before the district attorney brought the application, it was too long a delay to justify. In addition, the Wyoming County Court had authority to remand a prisoner to the authorities of another county and to order that certain proceedings be had in any court of original jurisdiction in the state where the matter before the court was properly cognizable in a habeas corpus proceeding. Practicality and necessity justified the use of habeas corpus; consequently, habeas corpus was an appropriate remedy for the prisoner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

The Director of the New York State Office of Employee Relations requested that the employees be designated managerial or confidential. The employees brought an action objecting that the statute unconstitutionally deprived them of their benefits. The court held that N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 214 did not fail for vagueness and did not violate the employees' rights of due process, freedom of association, and equal protection. The statute provided a reasonable means for limiting the number of employees designated by the employer.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Amendments of the Civil Service Law ( &sect; 201, subd 7; &sect; 214) provide that certain managerial and confidential public employees, as designated by the public employer upon application to the Public Employment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Relations Board (PERB), should not hold office in or be a member of any employee organization in which employees of the same employer are members.  Subdivision 7 of section 201 which defines &quot;public employee&quot; does not fail for vagueness. It is not invalid for failure to identify who is to act for the State, the &quot;public employer&quot;.  It is unrealistic to expect that it would name the responsible individual for every imaginable case.  The &quot;public employer&quot; is sufficiently defined in the Civil Service Law ( &sect; 201, subd. 6) in terms of the various political subdivisions and authorities, commission's agencies or departments, each of which can be readily identified in any given case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Under the statutory plan, the public employer designates the subject employees to PERB, which, acting under its grant of authority in paragraph (j) of subdivision 5 of section 205, may approve or disapprove the designations, an administrative decision-making process calling for the exercise of discretion and expertise.  This is a permissible delegation of authority limited by the direction that it be &quot;reasonably&quot; exercised within the standards set by the Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The statute provides that the employees&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  designated must &quot;(a) formulate policy&quot; or &quot;(b) assist directly in the preparation for and conduct of collective negotiations&quot; or &quot;have a major role in the administration of agreements or in personnel administration provided that such role is not of a routine or clerical nature and requires exercise of independent judgment&quot;.  The standards are sufficient under established administrative law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The amendments do not violate plaintiffs' rights of due process, freedom of association, and equal protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The amendments do not unconstitutionally impair plaintiffs' contractual rights.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment from the Court of Claims (New York), which granted the motion by respondent state, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3211, to dismiss appellant's claim on the grounds that the court did not have jurisdiction of the subject matter and that the claim had failed to state a cause of action. Appellant had sought recover for damages for wrongful appropriation of property by the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By prior decision 1966 N.Y. Laws ch. 691 had been declared unconstitutional because it unreasonably deprived appellant of the beneficial use of its property without payment of just compensation. After that determination appellant filed the instant claim against the state seeking damages for the temporary appropriation of its interests during the period between the enactment of the statute and when it was finally issued a demolition permit. The state argued that it had no liability for damages and the claims court granted summary judgment to the state. On appeal the court reversed and held that: (1) the claim could not be dismissed at this stage of the proceedings for failure to allege an appropriation; and (2) the state was the proper party responsible for the de facto appropriation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, which had been in favor of the state, and ordered that the motion to dismiss appellant's claim be denied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Keystone Assoc. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Moerdler</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (19 N Y 2d 78), the court held that chapter 691 of the Laws of 1966 was unconstitutional in that it unreasonably deprived the claimant of the beneficial use of its property without payment of just compensation.  After this determination, claimant filed the instant claim against the State for damages for the temporary appropriation of its interests during the period between the enactment of the statute and January 17, 1967, when&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  it was finally issued a demolition permit. Because of the prior decision, it cannot be held that, as a matter of law, there was no </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appropriation. There was in fact an appropriation of property interests, necessarily temporary in nature, prior to the final determination by the courts as to the validity of the special law.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The power of eminent domain was exercised by the State of New York whether directly or indirectly through the created corporation.  Since chapter 691 of the Laws of 1966 was declared unconstitutional, there is no autonomous corporation which could be liable.  There is no basis for liability on the part of the City of New York and no impediment to liability on the part of the State.  Particularly because of the decision of the Court of Appeals in the prior action, the State is the proper party responsible for the alleged </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appropriation. The motion to dismiss the claim should be denied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order of the County Court of Steuben County (New York), which found defendant, who had been adjudged a wayward minor, guilty of violating his probation, which revoked defendant's probation, and which sentenced him to a reformatory term under the jurisdiction of the New York State Department of Correction.</SPAN></P>

The court, in reversing the trial court's judgment, agreed with both of defendant's assertions. First, the court, noting that &sect; 913 applied to defendant's case even though it was omitted from a recent change to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law, found that the &sect; 913 provided for a punishment in excess of six months and was unconstitutional because it failed to afford defendant a jury trial. Next, the court found that the language of &sect; 913-a, that required findings of moral depravity, was unconstitutional as vague and ambiguous and, because the information and judgment against defendant was based on a finding of moral depravity, dismissed the information.</SPAN></P>

Section 33 allowed those employees that had been transferred to the employ of federal government and then back to the state to obtain such credit under certain conditions. State officials denied the application and the trial court upheld that decision. The court affirmed the trial court's decision and found that &sect; 33 did not apply to the state employee's because they were hired by the federal government and were not transferred to federal employ from the state.

Defendant entered guilty pleas for criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the third degree and criminal possession of a hypodermic instrument. Defendant appealed on grounds that &sect; 240.40 was unconstitutional and that the contraband should have, therefore, been suppressed. The court affirmed the lower court. The court examined the statute to determine whether the effect of its stricture had a direct relationship to the achievement of a legitimate purpose advancing public morality, health, and order under the police power. The court held that &sect; 240.40 met the test because it did not exact punishment for a mere chronic condition, but for a condition from which it could fairly be expected that a resulting danger from the accused's conduct would arise. Section 240.40 did not violate the Eighth Amendment because it punished the behavior as a result of defendant's intoxication.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The defendant, who pleaded guilty to the crimes of attempted sale of a dangerous drug, criminal possession of a dangerous&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  drug and criminal possession of a hypodermic instrument, was initially arrested for public intoxication (Penal Law, &sect; 240.40) and the search of his person incident to the arrest revealed the contraband. Section 240.40 of the Penal Law provides: &quot;A person is guilty of public intoxication when he appears in a public place under the influence of alcohol, narcotics or other drug to the degree that he may endanger himself or other persons or property, or annoy persons in his vicinity.&quot; Two police officers, cruising in a patrol car in the evening, saw the defendant walking erratically on the sidewalk.  They accosted him to ascertain his name, his residence and his destination but he did not reply.  The police officers came to the conclusion that he was under the influence of narcotics and a danger to himself.  He was not known to the officers and they testified that there were no other persons in the vicinity and that nothing indicated to them that the defendant was dangerous to others.  The statute is not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. There is a direct relation between the conduct condemned by the statute and the legitimate interest which the community has in preserving the public order. The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  statute adds to the requirement of defendant's public intoxication that it also appear that &quot;he may endanger himself or others or property, or annoy persons in his vicinity.&quot; The statute does not exact punishment for merely a condition, but for a condition from which it may fairly be expected that a resulting danger or annoyance from the accused's conduct will arise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The statute does not provide for cruel and inhuman treatment. It may be cruel and inhuman punishment to direct sanctions against chronic intoxication or drug addiction, but that is not the thrust of this statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. While the arrest depends on the judgment of the arresting officers that the intoxication of the accused is of such a degree that future behavior of the accused will endanger or annoy others, the test of whether the exercise of judgment was right is the reasonableness of the judgment in the light of the circumstances.  It must be left to the judgment of the arresting officers, subject to trial and cross-examination, to determine whether the action of the accused causes the reasonable belief that the latter may create peril or annoyance to himself or to others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The circumstances observed by the officers&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  justified the defendant's arrest and the Criminal Term was correct in denying his motion to suppress the evidence found after the arrest. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners appealed an order and judgment from the Supreme Court at Special Term Albany County (New York), which granted the motions of respondents, the governor and others, for summary judgment declaring that 1972 N.Y. Laws ch. 11 was a valid apportionment statute under the Constitutions of the United States and of the State of New York.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Legislature introduced bills to create state Assembly and Senate districts based upon the 1970 federal census, the legislation was signed into law by the governor. Petitioners challenged its constitutionality, arguing that the law violated both U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.Y. Const. art. III. The trial court dismissed the petition and declared the law to be valid. On appeal, the court held that the state prohibition against dividing counties or towns was subordinated to the federal doctrine of &quot;one man, one vote,&quot; and thus, it was not discriminatory to cross boundaries of political subdivisions to achieve as nearly as possible equal population among legislative districts. Further, the mandates of N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 4 and 5 were followed because the districts were in &quot;as compact form as practicable&quot; and consisted of &quot;contiguous territory.&quot; While agreeing that some districts resulted in oddly shaped designs, the requirement to meet population equality made such an end necessary. Last, the court held that the increase in the number of senators complied with N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 4 and the three-day requirement of N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 14 was also followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order and judgment dismissing the petition and declaring the apportionment statute valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- apportionment of Legislature -- chapter 11 of Laws of 1972 which apportioned Legislature did not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutionally</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> divide counties in creating districts since prohibition against division of counties must give way to one man, one vote doctrine -- requirements of Constitution that districts be &quot;compact&quot; and &quot;contiguous&quot; were not violated -- there was no gerrymandering -- increase of Senate from 50 to 60 members complied with Constitution -- bill was on desks of legislators for three calendar days -- census figures used were latest corrected figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Chapter 11 of the Laws of 1972 apportioned the Legislature of the State.  It divided 9 minor counties in the formation of Senate districts and 11 minor counties in the formation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Assembly districts.  The constitutional prohibition against dividing counties or towns must be subordinated to the Federal doctrine of one man, one vote. It is not discriminatory to cross boundaries of political subdivisions to achieve as nearly as possible equal population among legislative districts.  Chapter 11 does not violate constitutional provisions by its division of counties in the formation of districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The requirements of the State Constitution that districts be in &quot;as compact form as practicable&quot; and to consist of &quot;contiguous territory&quot; were not violated.  While some districts are shaped in odd designs, the requirement that there be population equality leads to such an end.  In none of the districts cited as &quot;noncontiguous&quot; is it necessary to travel through an adjoining district to keep within the boundaries of the districts.  The requirement of contiguity is not violated because part of the district is divided by water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There was no gerrymandering in violation of public policy.  If the mathematics of new district lines are acceptable, the courts should not review claims of partisanship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The increase of the Senate from 50 to 60 members was in compliance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with the formula of section 4 of article III of the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The constitutional requirement that the bill be on the desks of the legislators for three calendar days was met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. On October 15, 1971 the Bureau of the Census advised the Joint Legislative Committee on Reapportionment by letter that its review of the 1970 census figures was complete and accurate.  Accordingly, the population statistics used in drawing the district lines described in chapter 11 were the latest corrected Federal census figures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner accused filed a proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 for a judgment prohibiting respondents, county judges and district attorney, from retrying the accused on a grand jury indictment on the ground that reprosecution would have constituted double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accused was indicted on a criminal charge. A trial by jury was waived, and a bench trial was commenced, at which a witness testified for the People and was extensively cross-examined by defense counsel. The next day, the trial judge, sua sponte, declared a mistrial on the ground that his chambers had been contacted by the father of the accused, who was acquainted with the judge's cousin. Over the objection of defense counsel, who asserted the accused's double jeopardy rights under U.S. Const. amend. V. and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, the trial court placed the action on the calendar for a retrial. The accused filed a proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, seeking a judgment prohibiting the county's judges and district attorney from reprosecuting the action. The court entered judgment in favor of the accused. The court held that there was no manifest necessity for the trial judge's declaration of a mistrial, and a reprosecution after a mistrial had been unnecessarily declared would have subjected the accused to personal strain and insecurity in violation of both the United States and New York constitutions, regardless of the motivation underlying the trial judge's action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered a judgment prohibiting the judges and district attorney from retrying the accused.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- former jeopardy -- proceeding in nature of prohibition is traditional remedy where double jeopardy is claimed to exist -- in trial without jury, after first witness testified, Judge declared mistrial because petitioner's father had once called his chambers about petitioner; such basis for mistrial was insufficient; retrial would subject petitioner to double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A proceeding under article 78 CPLR in the nature of prohibition is the traditional remedy where double jeopardy is claimed to exist.  Petitioner should not be compelled to submit to a retrial and there raise the defense of double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The morning after petitioner's trial before a Judge without a jury opened with a police witness, the Trial Judge held a conference in chambers with opposing counsel and announced that he recalled petitioner's father having telephoned the Judge's chambers and had been told&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to consult his lawyer.  The Judge then stated that &quot;perhaps it would be improper for me to adjudicate this matter&quot; and that &quot;the recalling of this incident could in some conceivable way have an [effect] upon my judgment&quot;.  He thereupon declared a mistrial. Such &quot;iffy&quot; reasons for declaring a mistrial are unacceptable especially since the Trial Judge was told that petitioner would oppose a retrial on the ground of double jeopardy. Petitioner is entitled to judgment prohibiting respondents from retrying him.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant department store operator sought review of a decision from the Supreme Court of Onondaga County (New York), which granted respondent village's motion for summary judgment in its action against the village to have an ordinance restricting the business hours of establishments on certain holidays declared invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the five-hour restriction on sales from 10:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. was a valid exercise of the village's power and that the ordinance had a real and substantial relationship to a proper and orderly observance of the holidays. Upon review, the court agreed with the trial court's decision. The ordinance was specifically authorized by N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 86 and was not prohibitory in scope. Also, the operator failed to prove that the ordinance bore no rational relationship to the end sought by the village. The restriction on sales for a period of five hours was reasonably related to the observance of the two national holidays and, therefore, did not amount to a taking of property without due process of law. The restriction of sales businesses and not others did not deny the operator equal protection of the law. While the ordinance could have regulated other businesses, there was no necessity that it did so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the village in the operator's action to have the ordinance declared invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- power to enact ordinance -- ordinance enacted by defendant village making it unlawful, with stated exceptions, to offer articles of property for sale on Memorial Day or Independence Day between 10:30 A.M. and 3:30 P.M. specifically authorized by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 86 of General Municipal Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- ordinance does not amount to deprivation of due process -- meaning of word &quot;souvenirs&quot; not vague -- no denial of equal protection of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 86 of the General Municipal Law grants the municipalities in the State power to enact &quot;ordinances regulating the nature of commercial and business activities that may be conducted on Memorial day and Independence day and the hours within which * * * business activities may be conducted&quot;.  Pursuant to such authority, defendant village enacted an ordinance on June 7, 1971 which provided, in part, that, with stated exceptions, &quot;It shall be unlawful, in the Village of Herkimer, New York, for any&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  person, firm or corporation to sell or offer for sale any article of property on Memorial Day or Independence Day during the hours of 10:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.&quot; The ordinance is specifically authorized by section 86 of the General Municipal Law and is not prohibitory in scope.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In determining that an ordinance amounts to a deprivation of due process, it must be found that the law is unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious, and that the means selected have no real and substantial relation to the object sought to be obtained.  Ordinances have a strong presumption of validity and the burden of proof to show that they bear no rational relationship to the end sought is on the person challenging the law.  No such proof is present.  The restriction on sales for a period of five hours is reasonably related to the observance of these two national holidays and, therefore, does not amount to a taking of property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The ordinance is not unconstitutional because the word &quot;souvenirs&quot; is vague and indefinite. The meaning of the word &quot;souvenirs&quot; is clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Restricting sales businesses and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not restricting other businesses does not deny plaintiff equal protection of the law.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of the judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County (New York) that held that the city had to bear the expense of the publication of plaintiff indigent's summons for divorce against defendant husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indigent obtained an order pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 1101 that granted her permission to proceed as a poor person. The indigent sought to obtain a divorce. The indigent was permitted to serve her husband by publication, with the city bearing the expense. The city sought reconsideration of its consent to service by publication on the indigent's husband with the city bearing the expense. The city argued that in absence of specific statutory or constitutional authorization, it was forbidden to make the payment requested even though the payment had to be made from public funds. The court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court determined that it was the responsibility of the state and not the city to pay for the cost of service on the indigent's husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court that ordered the city to pay the expense of the indigent's service by publication.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Husband and wife -- divorce -- cost of service of summons by publication -- burden of paying cost of service by publication of summons in indigent woman's action for divorce has not been imposed by specific </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> on City of New York and hence, obligation is that of State -- issue is not moot and will be decided even though city has already paid such cost since issue will recur and is of major importance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. By requiring payment of the cost of service by publication of an action for divorce, a State unconstitutionally&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  denies access to the courts by indigent persons ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Boddie </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Connecticut</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 401 U.S. 371). In an action for divorce by an indigent woman requiring service of the summons by publication, since there is no specific statutory authority imposing such cost on the City of New York, an order of Special Term which imposed that cost on the city is reversed.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">McCandless </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> McCandless</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 38 A D 2d 171, disapproved.)

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In this case although the city paid the cost of service by publication and is not likely to sue plaintiff to recover that expense, such payment does not make the matter moot. The issue affects many indigents similarly situated, will arise again, is one of major importance and will therefore be entertained and decided.  </SPAN></P>

Interested passengers filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that the10-trip tickets were valid, enjoining the railroad from refusing to honor the tickets, and denying the railroad's cross-motion to dismiss their complaint. The passengers asserted that the railroad was required to hold additional public hearing on the issue of changing its tariff schedule so as to dishonor the previously sold tickets. The trial court noted that a new hearing was not necessary, issued the declaration, and the railroad appealed. The court affirmed the judgment as modified to strike the declarations that the tickets were valid and enjoining the railroad from refusing to honor them after March 1, 1972. The railroad was allowed to implement its original tariff rescheduling plan because the court held that to rule otherwise would seriously impair the railroad's and MTA's ability to adjust fares as needed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, hospitals and attorney-general, challenged the issuance of a preliminary injunction by the Supreme Court, Queens County (New York), which enjoined defendant hospitals from performing any abortions pending final determination of the constitutionality of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff individual was appointed guardian ad litem for a class of unborn infants of less than 24 weeks' gestation scheduled for abortion.

The trial court issued a temporary injunction prohibiting all abortions not necessary to preserve the life of the female. The court reversed and remanded for entry of judgment in favor of defendants, hospitals and attorney-general. The court found no error in the appointment of plaintiff as guardian ad litem when considering the lack of time to try the merits and the inherent conflict of interest between the mother and fetus. The court found the class adequately defined and not overbroad. However, the court concluded that the provisions of U.S. Const. amend. V, providing that no &quot;person&quot; would be deprived of life without due process was not intended to include fetal life. The statute was not found to be unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. The court stated that the determination of the extent to which fetal life should be protected was a value judgment best made by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 3 of section 125.05 of the Penal Law, as amended in 1970 (L. 1970, ch. 127) to add a provision that an abortional act is justifiable when committed upon a female with her consent by a duly licensed physician acting within 24 weeks after the commencement&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of her pregnancy, is constitutional.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The present action, challenging the constitutionality of the statute upon the ground that such a fetus was a person within the protection of the constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection of the laws, was commenced by plaintiff after he procured an ex parte order appointing him guardian ad litem of a class of unborn infants of less than 24 weeks' gestation scheduled for abortions in public hospitals.  That order was proper when made.  However, in view of the determination of the substantive issue, now made upon an appeal from an order which had granted plaintiff a preliminary injunction against the performing of abortions other than those necessary to preserve the life of the female, and which had denied a cross motion for vacatur of the order of appointment, it should be vacated.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer appealed from the determination of respondent state tax commission (commission) (New York), which found that the taxpayer was principally engaged in the business of storing tangible personal property not held for sale in the regular course of business and that the receipts from these services were taxable sales of services within the meaning and intent of N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1105(4)(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer owned patented, coin-controlled lockers in which baggage and other articles for personal property were stored by the public. The contracts with the operators of the lockers provided that any taxes levied or assessed on the conduct, maintenance, operation, or gross receipts of the locker service were borne by the taxpayer and each operator in the same percentage as they shared the gross revenues. The commission imposed a sales tax against the taxpayer on all revenues flowing through the lockers. On appeal, the court affirmed the commission's determination. The short term checking of baggage was storage of tangible personal property within the meaning of &sect; 1105. The contractual relationship between the taxpayer and the operators was encompassed within the statute, and the taxpayer was a vendor who was liable for the sales tax within the meaning of &sect; 1101.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the determination of the commission that assessed a sales tax against the taxpayer for all revenues flowing through the locker rental service.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- sales tax -- petitioner, owner of coin-controlled lockers for storage of baggage leased them to owners of air, bus and railroad terminals; revenues are collected by owners who pay percentage to petitioner; Commissioner of Taxation determined that petitioner was vendor liable for sales tax; determination is confirmed -- tax applies to &quot;storing&quot; of personal property, even though for short time, in petitioner's lockers -- sales tax is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> burden on interstate commerce -- petitioner's agreements do not create nontaxable sale for resale -- petitioner is &quot;vendor&quot; within Tax Law, liable for tax -- petitioner cannot claim exemption as agency of government or charitable organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner, the owner of coin-controlled lockers in which baggage and other articles are stored for a 24-hour period or less, leases them to the owners&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of air, bus and railroad terminals. The revenues are collected by such owners who pay a percentage of the gross to petitioner.  Respondent Tax Commission determined that petitioner, as vendor, was principally engaged in the business of storing tangible personal property not held for sale in the regular course of business and that the receipts from these services were taxable sales of services within paragraph (4) of subdivision (c) of section 1105 of the Tax Law. Such determination is confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 1105 (subd. [c], par. [4]) provides that a tax is imposed upon the &quot;receipts from every sale, except for resale&quot;, of the service of &quot;storing all tangible personal property not held for sale in the regular course of business and the rental of safe deposit boxes or similar space&quot;.  There is no valid distinction between &quot;checking&quot; and &quot;storing&quot;.  The term &quot;storing&quot; within said section does not necessarily connote such duration as to preclude its application here, and there is no reason to limit its application to long-term custody.  When a patron deposits his tangible personal property within one of petitioner's lockers, he is storing his property even though only for a limited&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  duration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A sales tax on the use of locker storage facilities is not an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce and freedom to travel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The contractual agreements between petitioner and the various owners of air, bus and rail terminals do not create nontaxable sales for resale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Tax Law renders the vendor of the service responsible for the collection of the tax and liable for the tax imposed.  It defines a vendor as including one who makes &quot;sales of tangible personal property or services&quot; (&sect; 1101, subd. [b], par. [8], subpar. [i], cl. [A]) or one &quot;who solicits business either by employees, independent contractors, agents or other representatives * * * and by reason thereof makes sales * * * of tangible personal property&quot; (&sect; 1101, subd. [b], par. [8], subpar. [i], cl. [C]).  The contractual relationships established between petitioner and the various owners are of the type encompassed by such definition and petitioner, rather than the owners, is the vendor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Section 1101 (subd. [b], par. [8], subpar. [i], cl. [E]) of the Tax Law provides that the State, its agencies and political subdivisions are to be considered vendors when such an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  entity sells services or property of a kind ordinarily sold by a private person.  Section 1116 (subd. [a], par. [1]) grants an exemption to a government agency or charitable organization where the sale is &quot;by or to&quot; such agency.  Since petitioner is the vendor, it cannot claim any such exemption. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Elections -- students' right to vote -- Voting Rights Act of 1970 gave 18-year-olds right to vote; section 151 of Election Law which states that person does not gain or lose residence by reason of presence or absence while student and that student must present statement to prove residence is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> student is treated same as any other voter.</SPAN></P>

Section 151 provides that for &quot;the purpose of registering&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and voting, no person shall be deemed to have gained or lost a residence by reason of his presence or absence * * * while a student of any institution of learning; * * * Any person applying for registration who claims to [be a student] shall file with the board * * * a written statement showing where he actually resides and where he claims to be legally domiciled&quot;.  The Voting Rights Act of 1970 (U. S. Code, tit. 42, &sect; 1973 aa) enfranchised 18-year-olds for Federal, State and local elections. In these proceedings by 18-year-old students challenging the constitutionality of section 151, they are entitled, under the statute, to the same treatment and test as any other voter and a determination of their residency is to be made on grounds no more stringent or restrictive than any other voter. If a student seeks to register in his educational community, he should be required, just as everyone else, to present evidence of a bona fide residence.  The Voting Rights Act was not intended to grant students a preference over any other citizen.  The requirement in section 151 that a voter present an affidavit as to his residence is not constitutionally discriminatory.  Mere presence in a district&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  does not create a presumption of voter residence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney successfully represented the client in a contest that started when the client applied to the town board for a zoning permit to erect multiple family dwellings on his land. The representation lasted two years and resulted in a ruling that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional as it affected the client's property. The supreme court awarded attorney fees and imposed a charging lien upon the determinations, decisions, orders and judgments rendered and the specific property benefitted thereby. On review the court reversed and held that before there could have been a charging lien there had to be something awarded by the judgment to which the lien could have attached. The court noted that where the attorney's services did not create any proceeds but consisted solely of defending a title or interest already held by the client, there was no lien on the realty.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An attorney successfully represented his client in a contest which started when the client applied for a zoning permit to erect multiple family dwellings and ended two years later when the zoning ordinance was held unconstitutional as it affected the client's property.  In this proceeding pursuant to section 475 of the Judiciary Law, Special Term erred in awarding the attorney a sum of money&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for legal services and imposing a charging lien upon the client's real property to secure that sum.  An attorney may have a lien on books or papers in his possession or upon a cause of action and the proceeds of it.  The statute (Judiciary Law, &sect; 475) allows the attorney to secure payment of his fee by satisfying it from the fund created by his efforts.  Before there can be a charging lien, however, there must be something awarded by the judgment to which the lien can attach. Where the attorney's services do not create any proceeds but consist solely of defending a title or interest already held by the client, there is no lien on the realty. Here, there was nothing recovered or created by the attorney's effort to which the lien could attach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. If there is no charging lien under section 475 of the Judiciary Law, the attorney must bring a plenary action to determine and recover his fee.  The court is without power to summarily determine the amount of the fee under the statute.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties cross appealed from a judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term, Albany County (New York), in a proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78, which set aside a determination by respondent Commissioner of Education that petitioner college was not eligible for state aid pursuant to N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 6401 and remanded the matter to respondent for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court initially determined that the Commissioner's determination that the college was not eligible for state aid was an administrative decision and that the procedure followed by the Commissioner was reasonable and not arbitrary. The court next turned to whether the N.Y. Constitution prohibited state aid to the college as provided by N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 6401. The court determined that the college's practice of prayer together was not sufficient so as to conclude that a denominational tenet or doctrine was taught to a degree sufficient to proscribe state aid. Moreover, the court concluded that the college was not an institution wholly or in part under the control or direction of a religious denomination. Finally, neither the state constitution nor the federal constitution required that the college be denied state aid. There was not such a degree of entanglement as would violate the First Amendment. The court concluded that the college was an institution whose predominant higher education mission was to provide its students with a secular education. As such it should not have been denied state aid. Accordingly, the court affirmed the judgment was modified.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Colleges and universities -- eligibility for State aid -- petitioner, women's college founded and operated by Ursuline Nuns, was neither</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> &quot;school * * * in which any denominational tenet or doctrine is taught&quot; nor &quot;under the control or direction of any religious denomination&quot; so as to be ineligible for public moneys under &quot;Blaine Amendment&quot; (N. Y. Const., art. XI, &sect; 3), nor would State aid to petitioner advance or inhibit religion or result in excessive entanglement of State with religion in violation of United States Constitution (1st Amdt.); accordingly determination of respondent Commissioner of Education holding petitioner constitutionally ineligible for State aid (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Education Law, &sect; 6401</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) was arbitrary and capricious and was properly set aside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner College of New Rochelle, a liberal arts college for women founded by the order of Ursuline Nuns who share in its administration and comprise part of its board of trustees and faculty, cannot be said to teach a doctrine of a particular religious denomination exclusively nor is it so controlled or directed by a religious denomination as to attempt to, or actually, inculcate the doctrine and faith of the denomination. Accordingly it was neither a &quot;school or institution of learning wholly or in part under the control or direction of any religious denomination&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  nor one &quot;in which any denominational tenet or doctrine is taught&quot; in aid of which the &quot;Blaine Amendment&quot; (N. Y. Const., art. XI, &sect; 3) prohibits the use of public moneys.  Section 6401 of the Education Law which authorizes respondent Commissioner of Education to apportion and pay State aid to private institutions of higher learning, provides (subd. 2, par. d) that the institution must be eligible for State aid under provisions of the State and Federal Constitutions.  A determination by respondent Commissioner that petitioner was not eligible under the State Constitution for State aid pursuant to section 6401 was arbitrary and capricious and, in a CPLR article 78 proceeding was properly set aside by Special Term.  However, since petitioner should not have been denied State aid, Special Term should have granted the petition rather than remanding the matter to respondent for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Furthermore, State aid to petitioner would neither advance nor inhibit religion. Moreover, there would result no such degree of excessive entanglement of the State with religion as would violate the First Amendment.  Petitioner, accordingly, is eligible also for such aid under the provisions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The procedure followed by respondent Commissioner, including a request that petitioner fill out and return a pertinent questionnaire as to its purposes, policies, governance, faculty, student body, curricula and programs and an invitation to petitioner's representatives to meet with respondent's staff to ensure that all information was current, complete, and accurate, was reasonable and not arbitrary.  Inasmuch as respondent's determination, made pursuant to authority delegated to him by the Legislature, was administrative rather than quasi-judicial, no adversary hearing was required so long as the determination had a rational basis and was reasonable and fair.  </SPAN></P>

The landowner asserted seven affirmative defenses, which the state water commission sought to have dismissed. The trial court denied the motion as to all but one ground, and the state water commission appealed. The court modified the order. The court held that the landowner's assertion that the action was time-barred should have been dismissed. The court said that the six-year statute of limitations for spoliation or misappropriation of state property found in N.Y. C.P.L.R. 213(5) and N.Y. Exec.

In an action to enjoin defendant from further placing of fill in the navigable waters of Cayuga Lake without first obtaining a permit to do so as required by section 429-b of the Conservation Law and its predecessor section 31 of the Navigation Law, a first defense that the cause of action is barred by subdivision 5 of CPLR 213, which provides that an action by the State founded on the &quot;spoliation or other misappropriation of public property&quot; must be commenced within six years, must be dismissed since such provision applies only to personal property and not to real property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The public interest in, and the necessity for, regulation of the water resources of the State in the manner provided by section 429-b of the Conservation Law render the statute constitutional as within the police power of the State.  The enforcement of the permit requirements of section 429-b is a proper method for regulating rights under the State's police power and does not constitute a taking of private property for public use. Since the State has the power to regulate waters even when title to the land under water is in private ownership, the issue of title is not involved in the action.  Defenses that defendant has title to the lands and that his property has been taken for public use without just compensation should be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A defense that plaintiff was guilty of laches in commencing the action was properly dismissed.

This restriction was authorized by N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf.

The trial court found the statute unconstitutional as a violation of equal protection. On appeal, the court reversed and dismissed, holding that there was a reasonable for the statute. Of the counties of the state outside of New York City, Nassau County was the most populous, had the most automobile registrations and the most accidents and, significantly, and a high population density. These factors constituted a reasonable basis upon which the Legislature, acting pursuant to its responsibilities in the critical area of highway safety, could have determined that driving in Nassau County was more hazardous and required greater skill, care and maturity than in any other county of the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court previously affirmed a denial of a motion to dismiss the claimant's action for failure to state a cause of action and lateness upon finding that the New York Court of Appeals' declaration of the unconstitutionality of the movie licensing provisions of N.Y.

In ruling on the cross-appeals, the court affirmed its adherence to the retroactive effect of the ruling to permit recovery by the claimant. Addressing the claimant's cross-appeal, the court awarded full recovery of the license fees, concluding that full recovery should not be denied on the basis that the majority of the licenses were granted in the name of the parent corporation. The court observed that the recording of the license fees in the parent corporation was contrary to a clause in a contract between the parent corporation and the claimant, a wholly owned subsidiary, requiring that all licenses be issued in the claimant's name.

However, $ 128,322.50 in total fees were paid by appellant-respondent alone.  Full recovery should not be denied on the basis solely of whether the licenses were granted in the name of the parent corporation or appellant-respondent, its wholly owned subsidiary. </SPAN></P>

The court held that the time controls placed on land use by the amendment were not legislatively authorized.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A town zoning ordinance amendment provides that the owners or agents of any subdivision in any residential zone must obtain from the Town Board a special permit to use the subdivision for any residential purposes.  The amendment further provides that the board shall not issue any such special permit unless the subdivision has at least 15 points computed on a sliding scale of development values based on (a) whether the following municipal facilities are or will be available to the subdivision: public sewers, public drainage, roads, firehouses, and parks or recreation or school sites, and (b) whether the town's 18-year plan to make such capital improvements throughout the town has reached the particular subdivision involved.  Such a wide-ranging legislative scheme exceeds the zoning powers which the State has delegated to any individual town or suburb (cf. Town Law, &sect;&sect; 261, 263).  Nor is this ordinance saved by a provision, which the town has enacted as a local law, permitting a residential developer to apply for a reduction in assessed valuation resulting from such temporary restriction on the use of his land.  Only the State Legislature can&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  delegate powers to grant tax reductions (cf. N. Y. Const., art. XVI).  This zoning ordinance amendment is declared invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although a proceeding under CPLR article 78 is not the proper vehicle to test the constitutionality of a legislative enactment, the Town Board has consented to appear and subject itself to this court's jurisdiction, and so the court treats this proceeding as an action for a declaratory judgment (cf.  CPLR 103, subd. [c]).  </SPAN></P>

Chapter 492 provides that the law shall terminate as of July 1, 1971 and does not provide that thereafter article 51 shall apply to the City of Albany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 17 of article III of the Constitution provides that the Legislature shall not pass a private or local bill relating to the &quot;opening and conducting of elections or designating places of voting&quot;.  Section 1 of article XI provides that the Legislature &quot;shall provide for the maintenance and support of a system of free common schools&quot;.  Chapter 462 of the Laws of 1970 does not conflict with section 17 of article III.  The statute is not local in nature.  There is reasonable basis for the establishment by the Legislature of both elected and appointed boards of education in different areas of the State.  The Legislature is presumed to have been cognizant of any local conditions.  Chapter 462 is general in nature and properly legislates the conditions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in Albany, furthering the over-all State purpose of education.</SPAN></P>

Although disagreeing with the trial court's conclusion that the Commissioner's action violated the due process and equal protection provisions of the United States Constitution, the court found that the directive was contrary to the legislative intent and public policy expressed by &sect; 125.05, which liberalized the state's abortion law, and that the directive should have been annulled as ultra vires. In addition, the court noted that the Commissioner had failed to comply with 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396a(d), which made the approval of the United States Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare a condition precedent to any modification of a state plan that reduced the scope or extent of medical assistance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Democratic County Committee and intervenor-defendant Republican County Committee (committees) sought review of the decision of the Supreme Court at Special Term (New York), which held that the committees' rules that no person could receive their designations unless they signed an agreement to refuse the nomination of any other party or independent body were invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The committees both adopted rules that no person could receive their designations or nomination for political office, other than judicial, unless they signed an agreement to refuse the designation or nomination of any other party or independent body. Several members of one committee brought a proceeding for a judgment declaring its rule invalid and the other committee intervened in the proceeding and consented that the validity of its rule be adjudicated therein. The court affirmed the trial court's decision holding the rules invalid. The court determined that N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 15(2) required that a party's committee's rules be consistent with the Election law. Section &sect; 248 contemplated multi-party nominations of a single candidate. In addition, the committees' rules contravened the basic philosophy of the democratic system, which forbid such undue impairment of the franchise. Voters were entitled to have equal, easy, and unrestricted opportunities to declare their choice for each office. Because it was unconstitutional for the legislature to prohibit a multi-party candidacy, it was certainly unconstitutional for the committees to seek that same result by the device of rules.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Special Term properly concluded that an article 78 CPLR proceeding was not appropriate to declare a rule of a Democratic County Committee that no person would receive its designation or nomination for political office unless he signed an agreement to refuse the designation or nomination of any other party or independent body, to be invalid, and that the proceeding, under CPLR 103, should&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be treated as an action for declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Subdivision 4 of section 137 of the Election Law authorizes a party committee to permit the nomination of one not a member of that party and section 248 contemplates multi-party nominations of a single candidate. Since the general policy of the Election Law is to permit multi-party nominations, and the rule under attack forbids such cross-nominations, it is inconsistent with the Election Law and such rule is unconstitutional and void.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, appellants, potential adoptive parents, sought an order declaring unconstitutional the religious affiliation requirements in adoption proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants filed an application as adoptive parents in the department of social services. Upon being interviewed by the assigned caseworker, they were asked a question regarding their religious affiliation. Appellants stated that they had no intention of joining any kind of organized religion. Based solely on this lack of an expressed religious affiliation their application to become adopting parents was denied. Thereafter, appellants brought an art. 78 proceeding, seeking an order declaring unconstitutional the religious affiliation requirements in adoption proceedings. The court denied the request. The court found that the practice of the department when interviewing the natural mother was to inquire as to her religious preference for her child. The court noted that, while the laws relating to the custody of children were secular, in the exercise of such power the State could not ignore the religious preferences of the parents. The State must recognize the right of the parent to guide one's child intellectually and religiously as being a substantial part of the freedom of the parent protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment of the trial court and denied appellants' request to enter an order declaring unconstitutional the religious affiliation requirements in adoption proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- religion -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Social Services Law ( &sect; 373</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">), </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Family Court Act ( &sect; 116</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">), </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Domestic Relations Law ( &sect; 113</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) and New York Constitution (art. VI, &sect; 32), which provide that child placed for adoption shall be placed with persons of same religious persuasion as child, are valid -- State has remained neutral, neither advancing nor inhibiting parents' choice of religion or nonreligion -- moreover, under subsequent amendments (L. 1970, ch. 494) such provisions need not be applied mandatorily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 373 of the Social Services Law provides that, whenever a child is committed to any agency or released, surrendered, or boarded out, such shall be, when practicable, to an agency or person of the same religious faith as the child.  Section 116 of the Family Court Act makes a similar provision when a child is remanded or committed by the Family Court, as does section&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  113 of the Domestic Relations Law when an authorized agency gives custody under court order for adoption of a minor in its lawful custody. The three statutes conform with the provisions of the New York Constitution (art. VI, &sect; 32) which provides that: &quot;When any court having jurisdiction over a child shall commit it or remand it to an institution or agency or place it in the custody of any person by parole, placing out, adoption or guardianship, the child shall be committed or remanded or placed, when practicable, in an institution or agency governed by persons, or in the custody of a person, of the same religious persuasion as the child.&quot; The provisions of the recited statutes are a valid exercise of the power of the State as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">parens patriae</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in regulating the manner in which the custody of children should be determined.  These statutes protect that free exercise of religious choice made by the parents of all children whose custody is regulated by the provisions of any of these statutes.  The First Amendment does not require the State to be the adversary of religion, but merely that the State be neutral in its relations with groups of religious believers and nonbelievers. In enacting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  these statutes the State has remained neutral, neither advancing nor inhibiting the parents' choice of religion or nonreligion but leaving it, when practicable, as it is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Further, subdivision (g) of section 116 of the Family Court Act, and subdivision 7 of section 373 of the Social Services Law amended the respective statutes in 1970 (L. 1970, ch. 494) to eliminate any requirement that the religious matching provisions be applied mandatorily. Both contain identical provisions that the previous subdivisions in the respective statutes &quot;shall, so far as consistent with the best interests of the child, and where practicable, be applied so as to give effect to the religious wishes of the natural mother * * * or parents&quot;.  These portions of the amended statutes place the primary emphasis on the temporal best interests of the child, subordinating the religious preference of the natural parents.  The legislative intent evidenced by the language used in these statutes clearly was to forestall any First Amendment attack against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Since the primary effect of these statutory enactments neither advances nor inhibits religion, and places primary emphasis on the temporal best interests&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the child, they are not violative of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to the Community School Board passing a resolution enabling parents of students who completed the sixth grade in June 1970 at certain schools to exercise the option of having their children attend different junior high schools, the acting chancellor issued an order to &quot;cease improper conduct&quot; and superseded the Community School Board with respect to the assignment of pupils. The order was based upon the ground that the Community School Board's conduct would contribute to making J. H. S. 109 a segregated school. Reversing the injunction issued against appellants as well as the summary judgment entered in favor of the Community School Board, the court held that N.Y. Educ.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Local Law No. 2 of 1969 of the County of Erie amends the Erie County Charter to place the deputies and employees in the criminal division of the Sheriff's office in the competitive class of the civil service and provides that those persons in the criminal division who have served for one year shall be covered in their positions without examination.  Since the Erie County Legislature has not been shown by plaintiff to have usurped a prohibited power, such local law is constitutional and valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 1 of section 41 of the Civil Service Law which exempts from the civil service &quot;deputies of principal executive officers authorized by law to act generally for and in place of their principals&quot; does not apply to a Deputy Sheriff since he is not authorized by law to act generally for and in place of his principal officer.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The inapplicability of the local law to civil division personnel does not render the local law vague and unclear.  The personnel commissioner of Erie County has already determined which deputies actually perform only criminal functions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The local law does not violate section 6 of article V of the Constitution because no examination is required of employees in the criminal division who have worked there for one year prior to the effective date of the local law.

An incumbent may retain his position without taking an examination where his position is reclassified from exempt to competitive, provided that his appointment was legal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  when made.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- unlawful search and seizure -- automobile in which defendants entered United States was subjected to line search at border and, when immigration officer observed antidraft literature on back shelf, he referred automobile to customs inspector who asked defendant owner to open trunk in which was found marijuana; motion to suppress such evidence should have been denied -- defendants failed to sustain burden of establishing that search and seizure were unlawful -- search was reasonable even in absence of suspicion -- there was reasonable basis for search in presence of antidraft literature prohibited under United States Code (tit. 19, &sect; 1305) -- customs authorities do not waive right to search because all vehicles are not searched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The automobile in which defendants entered the United States from Canada was subjected to a line search by an immigration officer and when he saw antidraft literature on the rear shelf, referred the automobile to a customs inspector&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  who asked defendant owner to open the trunk of the vehicle in which was found marijuana. An order granting defendants' motion to suppress this evidence is reversed and the motion is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendants have failed to sustain their burden of establishing that the search and seizure were unlawful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The customs inspector had the right to search defendant owner's vehicle as he entered the United States, and such search was reasonable even though the inspector had no suspicion that drugs were in the vehicle when he initiated the search.  If suspicion was required the border officials became suspicious when they observed antidraft literature, which gave reasonable ground for apprehension that contraband was being transported into the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Even if the immigration officer's selection of defendants' vehicle for a routine secondary customs inspection resulted from the observation of the literature, there was a reasonable and proper basis for such determination -- viz., that the antidraft material and vehicle might be examined to aid in the performance of the duty to exclude writings prohibited by the United States Code (tit. 19, &sect; 1305) -- literature advocating forcible resistance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to any law of the United States is contraband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. That some vehicles are searched and others are not did not invalidate the search.  Customs authorities do not waive the right to search persons or vehicles crossing the border by not searching each one.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a governor and other state officials, challenged the judgment and order of the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), which declared 1971 N.Y. Laws 50, 53, 54 unconstitutional in violation of N.Y. Const. art. VII, enjoined defendants from terminating the employment of plaintiff state employees and other state employees, and directed reinstatement with back pay of those state employees previously dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged that the budget and appropriation bills submitted and enacted by defendants contained lump sum appropriations in violation of N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect;&sect; 2, 3, 4. They further alleged that they had not been afforded due process and had been denied equal protection of the laws and that defendants had reassigned the duties of dismissed personnel in contravention of N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 6. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. The trial court treated defendant's motion as a summary judgment motion and granted the relief demanded in the complaint. The court found that the New York Constitution did not mandate the submission and enactment of a line-item budget in the form contended by plaintiffs. While the contested appropriations bills did not list individual employees and salaries, or materials and supplies, it could not be said that they were not broken down into items sufficient to show what money was to be expended and for what purpose.

The state appealed, and the court reversed concluding that the warrantless search of the defendant's impounded vehicle was reasonable. The court found that defendant's vehicle was searched solely for the purpose of compiling an inventory of its contents and was not an exploratory search for evidence. The court concluded that the police would have been remiss in their duty if they had not impounded the vehicle and removed it form the public highway because it was unregistered, uninsured, and did not have an inspection sticker.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff tenants filed suit in the Supreme Court at Special Term in Nassau County (New York) against defendant village seeking a judgment declaring &sect; 12(2) of the Emergency Housing Rent Control Law to be unconstitutional and a rent decontrol order to be unlawful. The supreme court held that the law was constitutional and denied the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. The village and defendant-intervenor landlords appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the challenged law, the village board adopted a resolution stating that a public hearing to consider whether decontrol of rent for village housing was warranted had been held after due notice and that after deliberation the board found that decontrol was warranted. The court affirmed the trial court's finding that the law was constitutional because the state had an interest in housing accommodations, and the authority to decontrol rent was lawfully delegated to the village, which had better knowledge of local housing conditions. The village followed the standard set forth in the enabling legislation, which was that it had to first determine that the decontrol was warranted. The court ruled that the grant of power was specific and that thus it would not review the board's finding that decontrol was warranted. The court modified the trial court's order by striking the order that denied the village's cross-motion for summary judgment. The court substituted an order stating that the law was valid, that courts could not interfere with the village board's action, and that the order of decontrol was valid. As modified, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In 1962 the Legislature amended the rent control statute to empower the governing body of a village to adopt a resolution requesting the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal to decontrol housing accommodations within the village after a public hearing on notice and upon a finding that decontrol is warranted (Emergency Housing Rent Control Law, &sect; 12, subd. 2).  In 1967, after the public hearing required by the statute, the Board of Trustees of the defendant village adopted the resolution authorized by the amendment of 1962.  Subdivision 2 of section 12 of the Emergency Housing Rent Control Law is not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Legislature, after the enactment of rent control in 1950&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (L. 1950, ch. 250), has gradually shifted the responsibility for the determination of the necessity to continue rent control to the municipalities in the State.  The delegation of power to the local unit of government is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. While the resolution of the Village Board professed to do no more than to reflect that a public hearing had been held after due notice and that the board found that decontrol was warranted, the board followed the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The only standard applicable to the municipalities is that the local governing body find that decontrol is &quot;warranted&quot;, without any other qualification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The contention that standards must accompany the delegation of power cannot be sustained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Where the grant of power is specially designated, the exercise of discretion by the municipality under the grant is ordinarily not reviewable. The Legislature might have removed the restriction on housing accommodations which it imposed without judicial interposition; so, too, where it allowed local units of government to make the same decision in light of local conditions, the apportionment of its power did not change the essential character of sovereignty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The cautionary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  words &quot;[if] warranted&quot; in conferring the power of decontrol did not subject the legislative judgment to judicial scrutiny. </SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding, to vacate an order of respondents, the Secretary of State and others, made after a hearing, which suspended petitioner's real estate broker's license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Secretary held a hearing and suspended petitioner's real estate broker's license, pursuant to N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 441-c. Petitioner had &quot;demonstrated untrustworthiness&quot; because of excessive and improper amounts charged for locating apartments. It was found that the fees charged were unrelated to services rendered and greatly in excess of those set forth in the real estate board guidelines. Petitioner's license was then revoked by the Secretary. Petitioner filed an application in a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding to vacate the Secretary's order, which was dismissed. On review, the court held that the language of the statute, &quot;for cause&quot; and similarly broad statutory standards had been upheld, to justify denial of license privileges against the charge of vagueness. Further, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it pointed to the untrustworthiness of a real estate broker, the courts construed it with limitations, and the acts upon which this suspension was based were proscribed by a criminal statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 180.55, which gave reasonable notice of what must be done and what must be avoided.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Husband and wife -- divorce -- wife's rights as tenant by entirety were not unconstitutionally infringed by provision (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 170</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. [5]) for divorce based on two-year separation of parties after separation decree; no need for judgment declaring parties to be married and that husband's Mexican divorce was invalid, as conceded by both parties; husband's securing such worthless Mexican divorce does not bar him from equitable relief sought; woman whom he married after Mexican divorce but whom he later divorced was not necessary as party to his present action against wife for New York divorce; husband was entitled to pretrial disclosure of wife's financial condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant wife's rights as a tenant by the entirety to the parties' former marital home were created by their marriage and rested on the common-law&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fiction of the unity of husband and wife. When a divorce occurs and ends the marital status essential to the existence of such tenancy the parties become tenants in common.  The State controls rights included within the marital status and may modify the grounds on which a marriage may be terminated. Accordingly, it may not be held that the wife's rights as a tenant by the entirety were of such vested status as to be unconstitutionally infringed by the provision (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 170, subd. [5]) for divorce based on the separation of the parties for more than two years following a decree of separation.  Defenses alleging such unconstitutionality were properly stricken from defendant wife's answer in plaintiff husband's action for a divorce under such statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The wife's additional defense that the husband was not entitled to partition sought in this action should also have been stricken.  By obtaining a concededly invalid Mexican divorce, he did not forfeit any claims to equitable relief. The prior separation decree between the parties contained no provisions against either's obtaining a divorce and his applying for and receiving the worthless Mexican decree cannot&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  bar relief under subdivision (5) of section 170.  The court, in determining partition of the property may take into account any expenditures made by the wife to protect the parties' interests therein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant wife's counterclaim for judgment declaring that the Mexican divorce was invalid and that she is plaintiff's lawful wife should likewise have been dismissed.  No controversy exists between the parties as to either prayer for relief, and plaintiff's complaint which acknowledges that defendant is legally married to him thereby concedes the invalidity of the Mexican divorce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Concomitantly the necessity of the presence as a party in the action of a woman whom plaintiff married after obtaining the Mexican divorce but whom he thereafter divorced also falls and a provision granting defendant leave to bring her in as a party should be deleted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Inasmuch as defendant has not squarely met plaintiff's claim of compliance with the separation decree, it is likely that a divorce will be granted and that, as incident thereto, new alimony may be provided.  The parties' financial circumstances are vital components in resolving that question.  No distinction can be made between disclosure&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the husband's finances, ordinarily directed in the absence of serious resistance to the right to a decree or of special circumstances indicating impropriety in such disclosure, and disclosure of the wife's finances. Defendant wife has submitted no countervailing circumstances rendering improper the disclosure of her financial condition sought by plaintiff and such disclosure plainly serves the objective of the parties' adequate preparation for trial and the orderly and expeditious conduct thereof.  Accordingly, defendant wife should be directed to answer specified items of the plaintiff's interrogatories. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the County Court of Schenectady County (New York), which convicted defendant, upon a jury verdict, of the crime of resisting arrest in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 205.30. The jury found that the arrest under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 167 for disorderly conduct was authorized by N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.20(1), (2), (3), (5), and that defendant intentionally attempted to prevent an officer from effecting the arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A motorcycle police officer found a car near the middle of a street, an open beer on the seat, the keys in the ignition, and vehicles behind it were blowing their horns. The officer drove the car toward the curb then defendant opened a car door and shouted obscenities, claiming the officer was stealing his car. Defendant continued his obscenities and the officer arrested him for disorderly conduct. At the time of the arrest, defendant struck the officer in the face and tried choking him. Although the arrest resisted was required to be an authorized one in order to warrant a conviction under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 205.30, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 35.27 (1968) provided that a person could not have used physical force to resist an arrest when it would have reasonably appeared that the person was a peace officer. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that defendant's exception to the jury instructions regarding the constitutionality of &sect; 35.27 was groundless where &sect; 35.27 protected not only the physical safety of the peace officer but the average citizen as well, providing a strong presumption of constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was convicted of the crime of resisting arrest in violation of section 205.30 of the Penal Law. The jury was justified in finding that the arrest of defendant for disorderly conduct was authorized and that defendant intentionally attempted to prevent a policeman from effecting it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 35.27 of the Penal Law (L. 1968, ch. 73, eff.

The statute protects not only the physical safety of the peace officer but the average citizen as well, in that it discourages physical combat and reduces the risk of injury. The prompt remedial redress against illegal arrest that is available through the courts negates undue oppression. Section 35.27 of the Penal Law as charged is not unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

The court disagreed, finding that the notice, although inartfully phrased, was sufficiently clear and unambiguous to be considered in compliance with the statute. The court noted that &sect; 210 provided for administrative review of the determination that an employee had violated &sect; 210 and that the teachers had not sought administrative review. It affirmed the dismissal of the teachers' petition, holding that the teachers' failure to seek administrative review foreclosed any consideration as to whether or not there was any strike and whether or not the individual teachers given notice participated therein.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an individual church formerly associated with the Presbytery of Albany, sought review of an order of the Supreme Court at Special Term, Fulton County (New York), which denied the church's motion to vacate its prior order dissolving the church and vesting its property and assets in the presbytery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The church, founded in 1828, incorporated in 1831, and reincorporated in 1966, was governed by the presbytery. After a doctrinal dispute, the church tried to withdraw from the presbytery's ecclesiastic organization. The presbytery then dissolved the church under canon law and claimed its assets. The church disputed the presbytery's right to the assets claiming that it was not subject to the presbytery's jurisdiction. When the supreme court held otherwise and denied a motion to vacate its judgment, the church appealed. The court affirmed. It held that the church had consistently recognized the presbytery's authority under the hierarchical scheme. The court also found no merit in a claim that the church was not subject to N.Y. Relig. Corp. Law &sect; 17-b because it predated the law. The court held that the church's 1966 reincorporation was accomplished only by compliance with N.Y. Relig. Corp. Law &sect; 63, which allowed incorporation of such a church only in connection with the presbytery's ecclesiastic organization, and that by reincorporating thereunder, it subjected itself to all of the related law as well as the presbytery's authority, which was properly enforced under 17-b thereof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the supreme court denying the church's motion to vacate the supreme court's order dissolving the church and vesting its property and assets in the presbytery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Religious corporations and associations -- disposition of church property -- property of appellant church, upon its being dissolved by ecclesiastical ruling body, was subject to disposition under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 17-b of Religious Corporations Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">; appellant was not &quot;associate&quot; member; its contention that section 17-b was not applicable to it as &quot;associate&quot; member is rejected -- even though property was held in its name, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 17-b of Religious Corporations Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> insofar as it affects its property is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Appellant church after incorporation became affiliated with the United Presbyterian Church of North America, which merged with the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America in 1958 to form the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On September 14, 1969 appellant attempted to withdraw from the United Church and thereupon respondent dissolved appellant.  Section 17-b of the Religious Corporations Law provides that, whenever the presbytery having jurisdiction dissolves a church, the court has jurisdiction to grant an order vesting all property of the dissolved church in the presbytery of jurisdiction.  No authorization exists in the constitution or regulations of the United Presbyterian Church for a church or its minister to be an &quot;associate&quot; member thereof, and therefore not subject to section 17-b as claimed by appellant.  The Presbytery of Albany has power to govern the churches within its jurisdiction.  Moreover, appellant consistently recognized the authority of the Presbytery of Albany and submitted to its jurisdiction pursuant to the hierarchial scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Appellant was reincorporated in 1966 under the Religious Corporations Law as the Second United Presbyterian Church of Johnstown.  Section 63 of the Religious Corporations Law provides for incorporation of Presbyterian churches only &quot;in connection with the United Presbyterian church in the United States of America&quot;.  Since the only &quot;connection&quot; recognized&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the United Presbyterian Church between it and a local church is one whereby such local church is subject to the authority of the hierarchy, submission to such authority was a condition of incorporation. Moreover, by its reincorporation in 1966, appellant became subject to the provisions of the Religious Corporations Law as they existed at that date and therefore became subject to the jurisdiction of the hierarchy in matters affecting, among others, the administration of church property. That the local church holds legal title to its property does not free it from the obligation to administer it in accordance with ecclesiastical rule.  The decision of the Presbytery that all assets be forfeited by appellant church, being a property decision of a hierarchial polity based upon ecclesiastical law may be constitutionally enforced.  Accordingly, appellant's contention that its assets were held in the name of the local congregation and that section 17-b of the Religious Corporations Law is unconstitutional because it adversely affects property rights vested prior to its enactment is rejected.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Regents of the University of the State of New York challenged an order of the Supreme Court at Special Term, New York County (New York), that denied their motion for summary judgment and granted plaintiff accountants' cross motion for summary judgment declaring that the prohibition of N.Y. Educ. Law art. 149 against the practice of public accountancy under an assumed or trade name was unconstitutional as applied to the accountants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accountants claimed that art. 149 violated both the United States and New York Constitutions and that they were entitled to continue their public accountancy practice under a trade name. The court reversed the summary judgment that the trial court had granted in their favor. The police power allowed the state to regulate the practice of accountancy, and the power of reasonable regulation included the power to prohibit the practice of accountancy under assumed or trade names in order to insure the maintenance of high ethical standards in the profession. The prohibition did not deprive the accountants of vested rights by preventing them from using the name under which they had previously carried on their practice. Grandfathering provisions in N.Y. Educ. Law &sect;&sect; 7407(4), 7408(2), that gave some public accounting corporations the right to continue to use trade or assumed names did not unlawfully discriminate against the accountants because the classification had a reasonable basis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The State, within the power of reasonable regulation, was authorized to prohibit individuals and partnerships from practicing as public accountants under assumed or trade names.  Plaintiffs were not deprived of vested rights by the prohibition against their use of the trade name previously utilized for their practice prior to the enactment of licensing requirements, nor denied equal protection of the laws.  The imposition of a new requirement for the continued practice of a profession carried on without the need of such requirements does not violate the Constitution.  Accordingly, it was error to grant plaintiffs judgment declaring that article 149 of the Education Law, in its application to plaintiffs, violated the Constitutions and declaring that they are entitled to continue their practice of public accountancy under the name &quot;Fiduciary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Associates&quot; and defendants are granted judgment declaring that article 149 is constitutional and that plaintiffs have no right to be licensed or to continue to practice under said name.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city adopted a tax levy based on equalization rates set by the state board.

The court held that the taxpayers had standing to sue and stated a valid cause of action. The taxpayers alleged illegal official acts that would produce public injury. The suit was properly brought against the state board, the city and the city officials together because the taxpayers claimed the parties collaborated to implement an unconstitutional and invalid tax plan. A declaratory judgment action was the proper method to challenge the city, city officials and state board's actions as the legality and construction of the tax statute, constitutional issues, and the propriety of official acts was at issue, and declaratory relief would provide a full remedy to the taxpayers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- capacity to sue -- plaintiffs, taxpayers in City of New York, have capacity to sue for judgment declaring that tax levy of City of New York is invalid -- State Board of Equalization and Assessment established special equalization rates under chapter 1069 of Laws of 1968 (Real Property Tax Law, art. 12-A) lower than those previously established with result that city would be enabled to impose higher tax levy -- plaintiffs directly affected by new rates -- they allege illegal official acts which will produce public injury -- State body or officer, charged with duty to enforce constitutional provision, is not immune from challenge that they are functioning beyond authority -- city and State officials properly joined in action -- declaratory judgment action is proper and not incompatible with action under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 51 of General Municipal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs, taxpayers in the City of New York, seek judgment declaring that the tax levy of defendant City of New York, adopted in 1968, is invalid. In June, 1968 the State Board of Equalization and Assessment established special equalization rates for the City of New York acting under chapter 1069 of the Laws of 1968 (Real Property Tax Law, art. 12-A) which permits the State board, upon application of the city, to establish the equalization rate for the current and preceding four years on the basis of &quot;estimated market values&quot; as the measure of full valuation (Real Property Tax Law, &sect; 1250).  The Constitution, on the other hand (N. Y. Const., art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 4, 10) speaks of equalization rates fixed on the basis of &quot;full valuation&quot;, without any reference to &quot;estimated market values&quot;.  The Constitution does, however, command that the Legislature shall prescribe the manner by which the ratio shall be determined.  Because the new rates were lower than those previously established the city would be enabled to increase its spending power and impose a higher tax levy. Plaintiffs, as taxpayers, have capacity to sue.  They are directly affected by the new equalization rates which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  result in a higher tax levy and a higher tax bill to plaintiffs.  Whether the statute is unconstitutional, or whether, if it is found that it is constitutional, the public officers concerned acted hastily and without proper foundation in the process of making new determinations under the statute, are both issues in the case.  Plaintiffs alleged illegal official acts which will produce public injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. While a taxpayer cannot resist the unconstitutional expenditure of State funds in the absence of a showing of a personal or direct injury to himself, a State body or officer, charged with the duty to enforce a constitutional provision, is not immune from a challenge that it or he is functioning beyond authority.  The complaint herein alleges that the State board has exceeded the constitutional power of the equalization of assessments delegated to it by the Legislature.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of O'Brien </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Assessor of Town of Mamaroneck</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 20 N Y 2d 587, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Posner </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Rockefeller</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 26 N Y 2d 970, distinguished.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Claims of constitutional and statutory violations are aimed by the plaintiffs at both State and municipal officials.  Plaintiffs allege that without the collaboration&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of both State and city officials, the invalid plan could not have been implemented.  Accordingly, the city and State officials were properly joined in the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. An action for a declaratory judgment is not necessarily incompatible with an action under section 51 of the General Municipal Law. On the contrary, a declaratory judgment action is preferred where the legality and construction of statutes, constitutional infirmities and the propriety of official acts are the points of inquiry and a decision will afford assistance to the municipality and its citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Where a cause for complaint has been stated, the form of the action or proceeding can be molded by the court even though usually an article 78 CPLR proceeding is invoked.  The action for a declaratory judgment provides a full remedy.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, Secretary of State of the State of New York, State Racing Commission, state racing association, jockey organization, and members, challenged an order of the Supreme Court at Special Term in Albany County (New York), which denied their motions to dismiss the complaint of respondents, owners, trainers, and racers of thoroughbred race horses and members of horsemen's benevolent protective association, and for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents had standing to bring the action. They had a legal right to race horses in New York and a legal interest in seeing that appellants did not impair the right. The fact that respondents had administrative remedies or might bring a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding was not controlling because respondents were challenging the constitutionality of a statute or administrative act and they claimed that an official was acting in violation of a statute to deprive them of valuable rights. Respondents' assertion that appellants were according preferred treatment at racing meetings to members of the state racing association with a resulting lowering in purses for respondents clearly raised a justiciable controversy. Moreover,a declaratory judgment action was available to test the constitutionality of the application of a statute to a set of facts and respondents' allegations clearly asserted that appellants were abusing the power granted to them. The trial court properly held that a constitutional issue was present and that triable issues of fact relating to that issue were present that precluded summary disposition. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision, which denied appellants' motions to dismiss respondents' complaint and for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Declaratory judgments -- when appropriate -- respondents, owners, trainers and racers of thoroughbred race horses in New York and members of Horsemen's Benevolent Protective Association, have standing to bring action against State Racing Commission, New York Racing Association and Jockey Club, as well as individual members of those organizations, for judgment declaring that appointments of New York racing officials and exercise of power by Jockey Club are illegal and for injunction barring officials from acting in their capacities, conducting racing meetings and making further appointments -- justiciable controversy presented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondents, owners, trainers and racers of thoroughbred race horses in New York and members of the Horsemen's Benevolent Protective Associations, Inc. [HBPA] have standing to bring an action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated against the State Racing Commission [SRC], New&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  York Racing Association, Inc. [NYRA] and the Jockey Club, as well as various individual members of these organizations, for judgment declaring that the appointments of New York racing officials are illegal, having been made under an unconstitutional delegation of power by the SRC; that the exercise of power by the Jockey Club is similarly illegal; and for an injunction barring any of the officials from acting in that capacity, conducting racing meetings, and making further appointments. Respondents have a legal right to race horses in New York and a legal interest in seeing that this right is not impaired by appellants and they need not break the rules and regulations of the NYRA and Jockey Club, thereby subjecting themselves to punitive sanctions, in order to obtain a legal declaration to their rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Nor, since the HBPA is a nonprofit corporation, was it precluded from maintaining this suit because of its failure to file a certificate of doing business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The fact that respondents have administrative remedies or may bring an article 78 proceeding to challenge any action of the NYRA or the Jockey Club is not controlling where, as here, the respondents are challenging the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  constitutionality of a statute or administrative act, or where they claim that an official is acting in violation of a statute to deprive them of valuable rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Similarly, respondents have shown the existence of a justiciable controversy. They assert that appellants are according preferred treatment at racing meetings to members of the NYRA with a resulting lowering in purses for the respondents.  Moreover, even assuming that the challenged provisions of the racing law are constitutional, a declaratory judgment action is available to test the constitutionality of the application of a statute to a set of facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The fact that the Attorney-General has brought an antitrust action against the HBPA in connection with a boycott of certain race tracks does not subject respondents to imposition of the doctrine of unclean hands. There has been no disposition of that action as yet, and there is no reason to assume that its result will be unfavorable to the respondents.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In this declaratory judgment action, plaintiff sought to have an ordinance, which made it unlawful, with some few exceptions, to sell any article on Memorial Day and Independence Day, declared unconstitutional, illegal and invalid. Special Term denied plaintiff's summary judgment motion and granted summary judgment to respondent, holding the ordinance to be constitutional, legal, valid and effective. The ordinance prohibited commercial and business activities and provided that it was &quot;unlawful&quot; to sell or offer any article for sale during the hours of 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., which are generally accepted business hours, on the two holidays. The critical issue was whether the ordinance is essentially a regulatory or prohibitory statute. The court found it prohibitory in scope and therefore held that it exceeded the powers granted to the village. In view of the court's determination that by reason of its prohibitory nature the ordinance was invalid, the court did not reach the challenge to its constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- appeal -- habeas corpus -- relator's appeal to Appellate Division from his conviction of conspiracy was dismissed because of his failing to argue his appeal due to his deliberate dilatory tactics -- dismissal was affirmed by Court of Appeals -- under circumstances habeas corpus is not available remedy -- in any event no merit to any arguments made by relator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Relator had been found guilty at an Extraordinary Special and Trial Term of the Supreme Court of conspiracy in violation of section 580 (subds. 1, 4, 6) of the Penal Law. Because of his actions in failing to argue his appeal, due entirely to his apparently deliberate dilatory tactics, his appeal from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Division was dismissed and that order of dismissal was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.  Under the circumstances, habeas corpus is not an available remedy.  It is not available as a substitute for the normal process of appeal.  While departure from the orderly proceedings, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such as appeal, may be permitted when dictated by reason of practicality and necessity, relator's case does not satisfy the practicality and necessity test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In any event there is no merit to any of the arguments made by relator.  The statutory provision for the exclusion from the Grand Jury and trial jury panels of persons &quot;who owned $ 250.00 or less in property value&quot; ( Judiciary Law, &sect; 662, subd. 3, repealed by L. 1967, ch. 49, &sect; 3) -- a requirement not enforced in this case -- the exclusion of persons who had scruples against the death penalty and the exclusion of individuals convicted of misdemeanors involving moral turpitude did not violate any of relator's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Concerning the argument that the prosecution's investigation of prospective jurors, both Grand Jury and trial jury, had a coercive effect upon the jurors in violation of relator's rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, relator knew of this investigation when the trial jury was chosen and made no challenge to it.  He therefore waived his opportunity to challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Subdivision 6 of section 232 of the Code of Criminal Procedure requires that the court, on challenge, in its discretion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be satisfied that a grand juror can act impartially or without prejudice.  This procedure has been approved by the courts and six of the jurors, aware of the investigation, testified that it in no way influenced their verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. There was no error in charging violations of subdivisions 1, 4 and 6 of section 580 of the Penal Law in one count.  The indictment does not charge three different crimes but charges different means by which one crime, conspiracy, may have been committed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The language of subdivision 6 of section 580 is sufficient to give notice of the type of conduct declared illegal.  It is not violative of relator's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. There was no due process violation based upon the alleged totality of circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. This case was tried before an Extraordinary Term of Supreme Court, the existence of which was maintained and continued to handle postconviction matters.  However, instead of submitting the habeas corpus petition to the Extraordinary Term, relator applied for his writ to a Justice of the Supreme Court, Special Term.  After the Justice signed the writ and released relator on bail, a second Justice determined that there should be a hearing and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  continued bail, a third Justice held the hearing, dismissed the writ, and remanded appellant to the custody of the Sheriff, and a fourth Justice granted a certificate of reasonable doubt and bail pending the appeal from the denial of the writ of habeas corpus. While the jurisdiction of Extraordinary Term is not exclusive, it would have been more orderly and efficient for this matter to have been referred to the Extraordinary Term or, failing that, to a single Justice of the Supreme Court, rather than to four Justices of co-ordinate jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The judgment dismissing appellant's writ of habeas corpus and remanding appellant to the custody of the Erie County Sheriff should be affirmed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners challenged the decree of the Supreme Court at Special Term (New York), which set a price for the taking of their land based on the value of the land as residential property in respondent County of Nassau's condemnation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners used their land as a junkyard, which was a nonconforming use. The county condemned the land. The property owners claimed that the highest and best use of the land was as the nonconforming use. The trial court determined the value of the land based on the county's appraisal of the highest and best use as residential, which resulted in a much lower value than the property owners' appraisal. On appeal, the court reversed. The court concluded that the trial court needed to weigh the effect of the zoning on the property because the restriction both lowered the value, since the use had to continued, and raised the value, since no other properties could be used as a junkyard. The court found that where the restricted use resulted in a higher property value, that restricted use had to be considered the highest and best use of the property. The court recognized that the nonconforming use could be terminated by legislation but in that case the property owners would be allowed a period of time to amortize the investment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court and remanded so that the trial court could include in the record the full scope of the factors combining to form an evaluation of the nonconforming use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent domain -- valuation -- junkyards -- county condemned land used as junkyards since 1951 as nonconforming use -- Special Term erred in treating junkyard as business not compensable in eminent domain and adding premium to value of land for residential purposes because of presence of junkyard -- court should take into account that nonconforming use possessed value arising out of restriction which made use nonconforming -- there was no evidence as to extent to which probable termination of use would affect value of land -- proceeding remanded for further proof and new determination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The County of Nassau condemned claimants' land which was located in an industrial zone and used as a junkyard, first as a conforming use, but since 1951, when the zoning ordinance was amended to prohibit the maintenance of junkyards&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in an industrial district, as a nonconforming use. The claimants' appraiser testified that the highest and best use of the property was as a junkyard, and that the property was worth $ 631,000.  The county's appraiser valued the property at $ 114,400, on the assumption of a residential use as the highest and best use and without giving any effect to the nonconforming character of the land as a junkyard. Special Term held that the land must be valued as though it were ready for use as a development for single-family homes and awarded a premium of an additional 20%.  The theory of the Special Term, in treating the junkyard as a business not compensable in eminent domain, and adding a premium to the value of the land for residential purposes because of the presence of the junkyard, was not the appropriate method of evaluating the claimants' land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Because of the zoning ordinance, claimants' pre-existing use of their land as a junkyard could not be halted, but only regulated, and at the same time competing junkyards could not thereafter be established.  The one effect tended to lower the value; the second to increase the value.  Hence, in determining the value of the land the somewhat&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  contradictory influences of the zoning restriction were necessarily to be weighed by the Special Term.  Special Term was bound to take into account that the nonconforming use possessed a value arising out of the very restriction which made the use nonconforming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Despite its character as a vested right protected from instant abolition by a subsequently enacted ordinance, the claimants' nonconforming use could be terminated by proper municipal legislation.  But the legislation could not be arbitrary or unreasonable in its requirements; the prescribed plan of termination must afford a reasonable period of time to the owner to amortize his investment -- a period of time related to the value of the investment, the possible relocation of the use, and the cost of the relocation, among other factors.  Here, no proof was offered to demonstrate that the municipal authorities contemplated the passage of an ordinance to end junkyards; or even proof of what period of amortization would satisfy the test of constitutional validity.  There was no evidence as to the extent to which a probable termination of the use would affect the value of the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The decree of the Special Term should be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  reversed and the proceeding remanded to the Special Term for further proof and a new determination.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant railroad commuter carrier sought review of an order of the Supreme Court at Special Term, Albany County (New York), which granted a motion by respondent State of New York for summary judgment, and from the judgment entered thereon. The Public Service Commission (PSC) initiated the action pursuant to N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law &sect; 56 to recover a penalty for noncompliance with so much of its order as demanded a response.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The carrier asserted that only those orders of the PSC, which were within the competence of the commission and properly served, were entitled to complete compliance and further contended that where a failure of compliance was a result of a reasonable doubt in the mind of the utility's counsel as to the legality of the order or the service obviating the necessity of compliance, then no penalty could follow. In the court's view, it was improper for the carrier to fail to comply with the statute in view of the choice given it to reject the order and refuse obedience so long as done in writing in the prescribed time. The requirement that the carrier respond to the order within 10 days was not unreasonable and did not deprive it of its right to petition for rehearing. N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law &sect; 23 sought an affirmative or negative reply but did not rule out an intermediate response. However, it demanded a response and particularized the manner in which that response was to be made. The record was clear that the carrier refused to comply with a valid and effective order of the PSC and consequently was in violation of N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law &sect; 56, rendering itself liable to forfeiture.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public utilities -- power of Public Service Commission -- Public Service Commission had authority (Public Service Law, &sect; 23) to direct defendant to notify commission in writing whether its order was accepted and would be obeyed -- letters sent by attorney for defendant stating that order exceeded authority of commission were insufficient -- defendant, having refused to comply with valid and effective order of commission, was in violation of section 56 of Public Service Law and liable to forfeiture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Public Service Commission, having found that service of defendant railroad was deficient and needed improvement, executed an order directing &quot;That Penn Central Company shall within ten days of the date of service of this order notify the Commission in writing whether this order, all of its terms and conditions and the revised standards of service&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are accepted and will be obeyed.&quot; Counsel for the railroad wrote to the Public Service Commission stating that the order &quot;exceeds the authority of the Commission&quot; and &quot;I have advised the appropriate officers of my client not to accept service on this basis&quot;.  Section 23 of the Public Service Law provides: &quot;Within a time specified in the order of the commission every person and corporation upon whom it is served must if so required in the order notify the commission in writing, whether the terms of the order are accepted and will be obeyed and in the case of a corporation such notification shall be signed and acknowledged by a person or officer duly authorized by the corporation to execute such acceptance and agreement.&quot; In this action by the Public Service Commission pursuant to section 56 of the Public Service Law to recover a penalty for noncompliance with so much of its order as demanded a response, Special Term properly granted judgment to the Public Service Commission.  It was improper for the railroad to fail to comply with the statute in view of the choice given it to reject the order and refuse obedience so long as done in writing in the prescribed time. The requirement that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  it respond within 10 days was not unreasonable and did not deprive it of its right to petition for a rehearing.  The Public Service Law ( &sect; 23, subd. 1) does not allow the Public Service Commission to require a utility to answer affirmatively. Instead, it permits the Public Service Commission to determine whether a utility is satisfied with a directive issued to it.  Moreover, the statute does not rule out an intermediate response.  Letters sent by the attorney for defendant were insufficient to satisfy the requirements of the order since they merely set forth attorney's legal advice. The railroad refused to comply with a valid and effective order of the Public Service Commission and consequently was in violation of section 56 of the Public Service Law, rendering itself liable to forfeiture as therein provided.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners and the village submitted a controversy to the court, seeking a declaration as to the correct method of applying a veteran's exemption under N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 458 and of computing the tax due so far as the landowners and others similarly situated were concerned. The village contended that in many tax districts property was assessed at only a percentage of true value and that the use of different percentages in arriving at assessed value caused veterans living in different taxing districts to be treated unequally, caused nonexempt property to bear a disproportionate share of the tax burden, and constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative powers. The court held that the village had no standing to attack the validity of &sect; 458 and that, because the landowners made no claim for repayment of taxes paid, the court did not reach the question of whether they were entitled to a refund. The village was required by &sect; 458 to deduct the landowner's exemptions, not from the full or equalized value of their property, but from the assessed value of property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined the controversy unanimously in favor of the landowners, without costs, and directed that judgment be granted without costs in favor of the landowners declaring that the village was to deduct veterans' exemptions from the assessed value of property and not from the full or equalized value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- exemption -- veteran's exemption -- veteran's real property exemption under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Real Property Tax Law ( &sect; 458</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) must be deducted from assessed value and not from full or equalized value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs, owners of a house and lot, are eligible for a veteran's real property tax exemption under Real Property Tax Law ( &sect; 458) in the amount of $ 5,000.  Prior to 1969 a 40% equalization rate was applied to the full value of the property to arrive at an assessed value of $ 5,480.  The veteran's exemption of $ 5,000 was subtracted from the assessed value leaving a taxable balance of $ 480.  In 1969 the veteran's exemption of $ 5,000 was subtracted from the full value of $ 13,700 leaving a &quot;net full value&quot; of $ 8,700.  A 40% equalization rate was applied to this figure to arrive at a &quot;taxable assessed value&quot; of $ 3,480.  Subdivision 1 of section 458 of the Real Property Tax Law provides for a veteran's exemption not to exceed $ 5,000 and sets forth the manner in which the exemption is to be applied.  Section 458 of the Real Property Tax Law states that all property shall&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be assessed in the same manner and that the veteran's exemption must be deducted from assessed value. The method used prior to 1969 complies with these provisions.  That used in 1969 does not.  In the future the village should deduct veterans' exemptions from the assessed value of property and not from the full or equalized value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The question whether this interpretation renders the statute unconstitutional is not reached since the defendant has no standing to attack the validity of the statute.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile sought relief from a decision by the Family Court (New York) that found that the juvenile committed acts that if done by an adult would have constituted the crimes of burglary and arson and adjudged him delinquent. The juvenile asserted that the family court erred in entering judgment against him without allowing him the safeguards during trial provided under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 399.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile sought relief from the family court's delinquency adjudication. The court reversed. It found that the sole evidence connecting the juvenile with the acts of alleged arson and burglary consisted of the testimony by an accomplice to those acts. However, during his hearing on a charge of juvenile delinquency, the juvenile was denied the safeguards that the accomplice testimony be supported by independent proof linking the accused to the crime. Thus, he was deprived of fair treatment and equal protection of the law. The testimony of an accomplice did not become more reliable because the accused was a juvenile rather than an adult. In fact, the necessity for supporting evidence was even more essential in view of the nature of the juvenile proceedings. A hearing conducted on a charge of juvenile delinquency had to fully comply with the due process requirements. Also, a finding of guilt in a delinquency case had to rest upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The assertion that the evidence against the juvenile still sufficiently established the acts charged by a preponderance of the evidence was invalid. The court reversed the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, which had dismissed the complaint, and held that the law failed to represent a proper and valid exercise of the legislative authority reposed in the city. The court found that by the provisions of the law, the city associated itself with the functions of a private landlord's association, which was supported by private funds, and thus was a private corporation and could not be considered as a city instrumentality. The court also found that the association was given the power to collect dues from its members and used the moneys received in furtherance of the purposes of the law, which amounted to the taxing of a particular class of landlords for the purpose of administering and enforcing the city rent control regulations, and constituted an invalid delegation of the legislative taxing powers of the city. The court held that the law violated equal protection because those landlords who became and remained members of the association were a favored class.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city appealed a judgment of the Supreme Court at Trial Term in Erie County (New York) awarding over $ 2 million in a condemnation proceeding filed by the city to acquire title to real property owned by defendant property owner. The property owner cross-appealed orders denying its application to modify the judgment and to assess fees, costs, and disbursements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city commenced a condemnation proceeding to acquire title to waterfront property owned by the property owner for purposes of an urban renewal plan. The city advised the property owner in 1957 that the taking would occur between 1960 and 1962. In 1961, the property owner bought another site and began building and moving his business in anticipation of the taking. At the condemnation trial, the trial court found that a de facto taking of the property occurred as of 1963, from which time the city should have assumed the cost of maintaining the property, which it did not. The trial court found that the acts of the city, including its protracted delay, destroyed the value of the property and that the city, by its threat of condemnation, forced the property owner to move its business operation. The court affirmed the trial court's findings, holding that there was a de facto taking by the city as of 1963, even where there was no physical invasion or direct legal restraint, because the city so interfered with the use of the subject property that essential elements of ownership were destroyed. The court also affirmed the trial court's valuations of the land and building.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of the property owner as well as the trial court's valuation of the land and building.

The court held that the trial court erred in denying the property owner statutory costs and disbursements and in denying an extra allowance for costs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent domain -- de facto condemnation -- city's acts, from first indicating its intent to condemn defendant landowner's property in 1954 until actual taking in January, 1967, resulted in de facto taking of defendant's premises as of date</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> defendant removed from premises in April, 1963 -- court properly valued land at $ 175,000 and building at $ 525,000 -- award of $ 84,000 for taxes, etc. since de facto taking is affirmed -- defendant owner is entitled to costs of moving printing machinery in amount proved by owner and not lesser amount -- notice of removal of fixtures to city was not required -- filing of separate notice of claim for removal of fixtures was not required -- award for fixtures not removed was improper -- interest at 4% and for later periods at 6% is allowed -- Buffalo City Charter (&sect; 393) does not authorize extra allowance -- for charter provisions governing condemnation to be constitutional, provision of Condemnation Law is read into it; so read, defendant is granted extra allowance -- trial court erred in denying statutory costs -- owner's application for payment of its counsel fees was properly denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Commencing in 1954, plaintiff city made known to defendant landowner that it planned to take the landowner's property for an urban renewal project.  Commencing in 1960, various officials advised defendant that it must get out within anywhere from 1 1/2 to 4 years.  In 1962, the Mayor advised&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant that it would negotiate for price of the property in the spring of 1963.  Defendant bought a site for relocation in 1961 and moved out of the subject property in April, 1963.  Formal condemnation did not occur until January, 1967.  There was a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> taking by the city's conduct which deprived defendant of the beneficial use of its property.  The city's acts forced defendant to move from its property in April, 1963 rendering the property unsalable and unrentable.  There was such taking even absent a physical invasion or legal restraint because the city so interfered with the use of the subject property that essential elements of ownership were destroyed and substantial justice cannot otherwise be had.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The landowner's expert computed value by estimating net rental income, deducting land value, and capitalizing the result.  He obtained a building value of $ 656,236 and land value of $ 193,766.  In view of the lower values presented by the city, the court properly found land value of $ 175,000 and building value of $ 525,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. An additional award to defendant for $ 84,000 in reimbursement for its expenses for taxes, insurance and maintenance of the premises since&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> taking in April, 1963 is supported by the record and is affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Printing machinery in the building was an integral part of a going business on the premises which constituted fixtures for which compensation must be awarded.  Since the machinery was movable, and the cost of moving it ($ 869,819.20) was far less than its value in place ($ 4,478,000) less the resale or salvage value ($ 509,250), plaintiff must pay only the moving costs.  Since the city offered no contrary evidence of such costs, the award of $ 785,000 was error and defendant owner is entitled to $ 869,819.20 for its moving costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The owner gave the city adequate notice of its intention to remove the fixtures, but, in any event under the circumstances of this case, no notice was required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Just compensation to the owner requires that the city pay for the reasonable cost of removing the fixtures and, therefore, the filing of a separate notice of claim was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The award to the owner of $ 84,000 for installed fixtures is reversed since it is reasonable to assume that these items were not removable without substantially damaging the freehold and cannot be the subject of a separate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Interest at 4% per annum is allowed from April 1, 1963 to August 1, 1966 (State Finance Law, &sect; 16, as amd. by L. 1966, ch. 921, eff. August 1, 1966) and thereafter at the rate of 6% until entry of the judgment and 6% should accrue upon the judgment.  The Legislature in adopting the 6% interest rate in 1966 indicated a rate of interest which is fair and just considering the rights and interests both of claimants and the public.  Moreover, defendant landowner failed to produce evidence to show that it is entitled to a higher interest rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Section 393 of the Buffalo City Charter governing the procedure in condemnation proceedings cannot be read to authorize an extra allowance of costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Article 21 of the Buffalo City Charter, governing condemnation proceedings commenced by the city insofar as it denies a landowner an extra allowance for costs, deprives the landowner of equal treatment under the law since another condemnor in the city must pay an extra allowance under the Condemnation Law. To be sustained as constitutional, subdivision 2 of section 16 of the Condemnation Law must be incorporated into article 21.  An extra allowance is granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. The trial court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  erred in denying defendant statutory costs and disbursements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. The owner's application for payment of its counsel fees was properly denied.  </SPAN></P>

The juvenile's requests for a jury trial were denied as was his motion for an order to require the county attorney to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The juvenile subsequently admitted to a lesser charge and was adjudged to be a juvenile delinquent. The court reversed and remitted the case. The court declared that N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 744(b), insofar as it required proof by a mere preponderance of the evidence, was unconstitutional and held that it was error to deny the juvenile's motion for a direction regarding the burden of proof. Although the juvenile admitted to a lesser charge, the court held that his admission was not voluntary because it was the result of the deprivation of his constitutional rights. The court held that the juvenile was entitled to a jury trial because he was charged with juvenile delinquency involving a serious crime and faced the possibility of incarceration of more than one year.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the County Court of Tompkins County (New York), which convicted him on his plea of guilty of the crime of reckless endangerment in the second degree under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 120.20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police investigated a disturbance at the home of defendant's mother-in-law. Defendant, who was pounding on the door of the home, pointed a gun at the officer. Defendant dropped the gun only after the officer hit defendant over the head. Defendant pled guilty to reckless endangerment in the second degree. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's demurrer to the indictment of reckless endangerment in the first degree. The requirements of N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect;&sect; 275, 276 were met because the indictment designated the crime charged, set forth the date and place of the crime, and described the criminal act.  N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 120.20, to which defendant pled guilty, was not unconstitutionally vague. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence as untimely because it was made on the eve of trial. The trial court's denial of defendant's motion to inspect the grand jury minutes was proper and was not appealable. Defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment as insufficient was properly denied where it was supported only by defendant's allegations upon information and belief and conclusion of law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was convicted on his plea of guilty to the crime of reckless endangerment in the second degree ( Penal Law, &sect; 120.20).  The indictment designates the crime charged, sets forth the date and place, where and when the act constituting the crime occurred and describes the criminal act, and accordingly, conforms to the requirements&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of sections 275 and 276 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 120.20 of the Penal Law which defines reckless endangerment in the second degree is not unconstitutionally vague and indefinite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence as untimely, since such motion was made on the eve of trial, some 12 months after the indictment. There was no justification for defendant's delay in making his motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In any event defendant's arrest without a warrant was lawful, as the police officers had probable cause to make the arrest, and the search and seizure were valid as incident thereto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The trial court's denial of defendant's motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes was proper, particularly in view of the fact that the trial court found that the testimony before the Grand Jury was in main the same testimony as presented at the preliminary examination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In addition, a denial of a motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes is not appealable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment as insufficient was supported only by defendant's affidavit containing allegations upon information and belief and conclusions of law.  A presumption&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of regularity attaches to the Grand Jury proceedings and the indictment, and the presumption cannot be overcome by an affidavit such as defendant's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The sentence imposed was not excessive. The court here considered the seriousness of defendant's act, his underlying problem of alcoholism, and the probation report submitted to it prior to sentence. It cannot be said that the trial court abused its discretion in imposing the sentence it did.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Board approved the plan, petitioner presidents of parents associations sued the Board, claiming that the plan violated the statute's requirement to retain racially, culturally, and ethnically integrated school districts.

Neither the plan nor the statute was repugnant to the constitution. The final plan was arrived at by constraint of the statute's inflexible mandate in respect of the minimum pupil population of a district. The Board fully complied with statute. The policy against both de facto and de jure segregation was not violated. The tentative plan mapped and delineated the boundaries of six proposed districts. Only two districts had more than the prescribed 20,000 minimum. The Board exercised its discretion within its statutory powers. How it was to be done was the Board's concern, not the court's. The opponents of the final plan sought a new opportunity to attack it.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 2590-b of the Education Law requires the members of the interim Board of Education of the City of New York to adopt a plan for the creation of school districts.  The statute provides that such school districts contain not less than 20,000 pupils. The board proposed a plan for the Borough of Manhattan containing six districts all but two of which contained less than 20,000 pupils. The plan set forth the criteria mentioned in the statute, and then noted that it was not possible to retain six districts while adhering to the mandate of a minimum of 20,000 pupils, but that the board had sought assurances that the Legislature would permit the board to retain the six districts.  A hearing was held and thereafter the final plan was promulgated with five districts, each district containing a minimum of 20,000 pupils. There was no deception on the part of the board in proposing the tentative plan.  It&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  noted that the six district plan could not meet the 20,000 pupil requirement.  No new or further hearing is required.  While no legally permissible plan was submitted prior to the hearing the entire subject was submitted for discussion at the hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state legislators challenged an order and judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term, Albany County (New York), that granted a motion by respondents, governor and legislature, to dismiss the legislators' petition for a judgment declaring that certain portions of appropriation bills enacted by the legislature violated N.Y. Const. art. VII and prohibiting respondents from expending further moneys.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislators originally filed their petition in another county, where respondents moved for a change of venue and to dismiss the petition. That trial court denied respondents' motions and granted judgment to the legislators, but an intermediate appellate court vacated the judgment and the order denying the motion for change of venue and remanded the case to the trial court whose venue respondents had sought in their motion. After that decision was affirmed by the court of appeals, the legislators commenced their proceeding anew with an order to show cause. The trial court dismissed the proceeding, holding that they lacked standing and that the proceeding was time-barred. The court affirmed the order and judgment. The trial court did not err in entertaining respondents' motion to dismiss. The motion filed in the other county's trial court was transferred to the trial court when the case was transferred and was properly before the trial court. The mere status of citizen-taxpayer did not confer standing upon the legislators, and their status as legislators did not give them standing to challenge the appropriations in the absence of a deprivation of due process or equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court that granted respondents' motion to dismiss the legislators' petition and the judgment entered on the order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- State budget -- petition in proceeding brought by three New York State Assemblymen, who contended that appropriation bills enacted by New York State Legislature violate article VII of New York State Constitution, properly dismissed -- status as citizen-taxpayer or as Assemblyman not sufficient to permit challenge of constitutionality of State Legislature acts or acts of State officers -- motion to dismiss proceeding properly before court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The petition in a proceeding brought by three New York State Assemblymen, who contended that certain portions of the appropriation bills submitted by the Governor of New York and enacted into law by the New York State Legislature in 1969, violate article VII of the New York State Constitution, was properly dismissed. The mere status of a citizen-taxpayer is not sufficient to confer standing to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  challenge the constitutionality of the acts of the State Legislature or of State officers.  To bring such a proceeding the taxpayer must show, in addition, that he is personally aggrieved and there is no such allegation by the petitioners here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The fact that petitioners are Assemblymen does not give them standing to bring the instant proceeding.  For a public body or official to challenge a State statute, it must be shown that there has been some deprivation of due process or equal protection of the law.  They have not been denied due process, or equal protection and, therefore, lack standing as Assemblymen to bring this proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The proceeding was originally commenced in Supreme Court, New York County.  The respondents moved for a change of venue to Albany County and also to dismiss the petition on several grounds.  Special Term denied respondents' motion and granted judgment to the petitioners on the merits.  On appeal the Appellate Division, First Department, vacated the order and judgment of the Supreme Court and remanded the proceedings to Special Term, Albany County.  This decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.  The petitioners, thereafter, commenced this proceeding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  anew. It was not error to entertain a motion to dismiss. Such a motion was before the court in the original proceeding, which was transferred to Albany County.  Consequently, all of the papers were necessarily transferred to the Albany County Clerk's office and were properly before the court.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A taxpayer had an arrangement with an independent contractor to sell the taxpayer's product which was manufactured in the state and was to be sold on consignment nationally. Taxes were assessed and the taxpayer objected. When the commission denied the taxpayer's petition for revision or refund of franchise tax assessments the taxpayer sought review. The court determined that sales made outside the state were properly included in the numerator of the New York state formula because the order for those sales were deemed accepted in New York and the procedure used to make the assessment was not unconstitutional. The court confirmed the commission's determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the commission's decision assessing taxes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- franchise tax -- by contract with taxpayer, foreign corporation acquired exclusive right to sell film manufactured by taxpayer in New York State -- foreign corporation remitted net sales price less commisisons to taxpayer -- sales by such foreign corporation of taxpayer's goods located outside New York at time of sale were properly deemed attributable to this State pursuant to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tax Law ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">&sect; 210</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 3</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, par. [a], subpar. [2], cl. [D]) -- inclusion of such orders not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- if taxpayer is paying franchise tax in excess of 100% on part of its income because three other States levy franchise tax, New York's formula is not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The franchise tax statute, with regard to sales of tangible personal property&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  attributable to New York, provides: &quot;An order shall be deemed received or accepted within the state if it has been received or accepted by an employee, agent, agency or independent contractor chiefly situated at, connected with by contract or otherwise, or sent out from a permanent or continuous place of business of the taxpayer within the state.&quot; (Tax Law, &sect; 210, subd. 3, par. [a], subpar. [2], cl. [D]).  In substance the formula states that sales of tangible personal property not located in New York at the time the order is made or received will be attributable to New York when the property is not located at the time of the receipt of the order at a permanent place of business maintained by the taxpayer outside the State and where the orders are received or accepted within the State.  During the years in question a foreign corporation and the taxpayer entered into contracts whereby the foreign corporation acquired the exclusive right to sell and distribute unexposed professional motion picture film manufactured by the taxpayer in New York State.  Upon making a sale and withdrawing film from the inventory, the foreign corporation was obligated to remit the net sales price less&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  its commissions to the taxpayer.  The taxpayer had no control over the manner and method in which the foreign corporation performed its business of obtaining and consummating sales.  The foreign corporation's connection with the taxpayer by the contracts and their performance was almost exclusively with the taxpayer's Rochester office.  These sales of the petitioner's goods located outside the State of New York at the time of sale were properly deemed attributable to this State pursuant to the Tax Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The inclusion of the orders received for petitioner's products outside of the State of New York in the tax formula under consideration herein is not unconstitutional.  Net income from the interstate operations of a foreign corporation may be subjected to State taxation provided the levy is not discriminatory and is properly apportioned to local activities within the taxing State.  The Due Process Clause will not be contravened if the taxes imposed are levied only on that portion of the taxpayer's net income which arises from its activities within the taxing State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. One who attacks a formula of apportionment carries a distinct burden of showing by clear and cogent evidence that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  it results in extraterritorial values being taxed. That burden has not been met in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Tax Commission states, in effect, that all of taxpayer's sales activities are in New York.  &quot;Sales activity&quot; does not mean literal selling activity, but any corporate activity relating to sales.  New York State is not attempting to reach the sales activity of the petitioner outside of this State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. However, taxpayer is paying a franchise tax in excess of 100% on a part of its income.  In addition to New York, California, New Jersey and Illinois are levying a franchise tax on taxpayer for its activity in those States.  Logically it is impossible, when the tax is fairly apportioned, to have the same income taxed twice.  In practical operation, however, the possibility of the contrary is not foreclosed.  In the present case it cannot be said that it is New York's formula that is unreasonable in application.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant was found eligible for adjudication as a youthful offender, pled guilty and was sentenced pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 75, which permitted imprisonment for up to four years. He appealed the sentence. The court reversed, holding that the trial court was deprived of jurisdiction to impose such a sentence because the crime was a serious one as defined by case law and the constitutional right of a youthful offender to a trial by jury applied thereto.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A judgment was obtained against the debtor for unpaid alimony and support of the debtor's children. Thereafter, the debtor fled the jurisdiction. The creditor then served a subpoena duces tecum on the debtor's mother. The mother filed a motion to vacate such subpoena in regard to the validity of the service of the subpoena and the right to examine. The supreme court granted the motion, and the creditor appealed. On review, the court reversed the order of the supreme court. The court found that service had been attempted pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 308(3). The court stated that in the light of the prima facie showing, the failures to deny except by argument and attorney's conclusory statements, while the persons with knowledge maintained a discrete silence, indicated clearly that the motion to vacate on the ground of invalid service was a pure sham. As per the right to examine, the court held that the judgment creditor's assertion that the witness knew the present whereabouts of the debtor was certainly relevant to obtaining satisfaction of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly dismissed the complaint because: (1) &quot;mobile homes&quot; were considered &quot;trailer houses&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 130(21); (2) once mobile, a structure remained a &quot;trailer&quot; regardless of the manner in which it was affixed to a foundation; and (3) the constitutionality of discrimination against such homes as single-family residences had been previously upheld by the New York courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accountant was convicted in federal court of furnishing a gratuity to a federal employee for or because of an official act performed or to be performed by a federal employee. He was subsequently charged by the Department of Education with two specifications, first, with having been convicted of a crime under N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 7406(1)(c), and second, of having been guilty of &quot;unprofessional conduct&quot; in violation of N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 7406(1)(b). Following a hearing before the subcommittee of the Public Accounting Committee on Grievances of the Department of Education, the Board of Regents ordered the Commissioner of Education to revoke the accountant's license. The accountant alleged that the subcommittee's denial deprived him of the opportunity to show that his conviction under the federal statute was not a crime within the scope of the Education Law. On appeal, the court reversed the relief from the certificate to practice revocation, and dismissed the accountant's petition. The court held that a subpoena duces tecum could in no way support this claim. As the board's adjudication under &sect; 7406(1)(c) was otherwise uncontested, its determination was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers timely filed their state income tax returns for the three years. But a review four years later by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue changed their method of reporting and thereby expanded the taxpayers' gross income and tax liability for the three years. The taxpayers filed a notice of change of income and assessments based upon the increased income were thereafter made. The taxpayers then petitioner for a redetermination of the deficiency and a refund of the income tax. On appeal, the taxpayers argued that N.Y. Tax Laws &sect; 373, which expanded the statute of limitations applicable to deficiency assessments, was unconstitutional by virtue of divesting the taxpayers of a vested interest. The court held that the mere extension of a statute of limitations did not violate any fundamental vested right. Similarly the court determined that the last clause of &sect; 373(4) did not render that section unconstitutionally vague. Finally, as construed, &sect; 373(4) actually benefited the taxpayers by limiting the state to a one-year period within which to recompute their income in the case of a reported change on a properly filed tax return.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, Commissioner of General Services of the State of New York (commissioner), city, and county, brought an action against defendant constructors under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3222 to determine whether a provision in the Deficiency Budget, 1969 N.Y. Laws 1, authorizing the commissioner to negotiate a contract for general construction of a library and museum superstructure was violative of the New York Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first issue was whether the enactment contravened N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6. The predecessor to &sect; 6 was N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 22 (1894) whose purpose was to eliminate the legislative practice of tacking on to budget bills propositions, which had nothing to do with money matters. The negotiation provision did not violate the spirit or purpose of N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6. The bill specifically appropriated over $ 136,000,000 for the construction of state buildings and other public improvements. Because the negotiation provision concerned an item, which could be constructed with funds from the appropriation, the provision related specifically to some particular appropriation in the bill, even though the particular appropriation to which it related was not precisely itemized in the general appropriation bill. The negotiation provision pertaining to the new state library and museum was not a local law within the meaning of N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 15. Because the provision did not violate the constitution, the court sustained the validity of the statutory provision pursuant to which the present contract was negotiated and directed that judgment be granted for plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- appropriation bills -- provision in deficiency budget which authorizes Commissioner of General Services to negotiate contract for general construction of library and museum superstructure is constitutional -- negotiation provision relates specifically to some particular appropriation in bill within meaning of State Constitution -- negotiation provision is not local law within meaning of Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 6 of article VII of the New York State Constitution provides that &quot;No provision shall be embraced in any appropriation bill submitted by the governor or in such supplemental appropriation bill unless it relates specifically to some particular appropriation in the bill, and any such provision shall be limited in its operation to such appropriation.&quot; The bill specifically appropriates over $ 136,000,000 for the construction of State buildings and other public improvements, including the erection of the building in question.  Since the negotiation provision concerns an item which may be constructed with funds from the appropriation, the provision relates specifically to some particular appropriation in the bill.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, representatives of a company, appealed an order from the Supreme Court at Special Term (New York) that dismissed a petition in a proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 for a judgment compelling respondent telephone company to restore telephone service to petitioners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A corporation disseminated anti-Communist, anti-socialist, and pro-American information through the use of telephone recordings. The representatives brought a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 to compel the telephone company to restore their telephone service which had been terminated for their failure to comply with a tariff. The tariff required an individual subscriber to state his name and address on a recording. The appellate court dismissed holding that administrative remedies had not been exhausted. On appeal, the court treated the petition as one for mandamus. The court found the speech regulated was not defamatory and did not tend to provoke immediate retaliation. Thus, the tariff was unconstitutional because it deterred freedom of speech and no substantial governmental interest existed to justify such deterrence. The court rejected the telephone company's argument that even if the tariff was unconstitutional, restoration of service was not required. The court found that the telephone company was bound to furnish service to all who paid the proper charges and obeyed reasonable regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment on the law and the facts, with costs, and granted the representatives' petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- recorded telephone messages -- telephone company adopted tariff which requires subscriber disseminating recorded messages when telephone number is called to state name and address on recording; Public Service Commission determined that tariff did not violate Public Service Law and that it could not pass on constitutionality; no administrative remedies yet to be exhausted; court should have assumed jurisdiction of constitutional question -- Public Service Commission is not necessary party in proceeding to compel telephone company to restore service to petitioners which was discontinued for failure to comply with tariff -- appeal is properly before Appellate Division rather than Court of Appeals -- proceeding is treated as one in mandamus -- tariff is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> as infringement on freedom of speech</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- service must be restored -- individual petitioners do not lack standing because they requested transfer of service to corporation supplying messages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondent telephone company adopted a tariff which requires a subscriber disseminating recorded messages on a telephone when the number is called to state his name and address on the recording. The Public Service Commission determined that the tariff did not violate the Public Service Law and that it could not pass on the constitutionality of the tariff. There were no administrative remedies yet to be exhausted before the courts acquired jurisdiction over this mandamus proceeding to compel respondent to restore service to petitioners who failed to comply with the tariff. The only new question other than constitutionality on which the commission could express itself is whether the tariff is unjustly discriminatory as applied to petitioners.  Where an attack upon the discriminatory application of a rule promulgated by a public utility is made, courts may exercise jurisdiction and mandamus is a proper remedy.  Moreover, initial resort to the courts is proper where only questions of law are involved and the issue of the constitutionality&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of a tariff presents such a question.  Special Term had jurisdiction to consider the constitutional question and should have taken jurisdiction of the claim of discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Public Service Commission is not a necessary party to the instant proceeding.  Discretion as to whether service is warranted lies solely with respondent.  The commission's consent or advice concerning the restoration of service is not essential and it has expressly declined to pass upon the constitutional issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The appeal is properly before the Appellate Division and not the Court of Appeals because the order is nonfinal, questions other than constitutionality have been raised, and the constitutionality of a rule of a public utility rather than a State statute is involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. It is not necessary to characterize the proceeding, since it was error to dismiss the petition even if petitioners have chosen the wrong remedy, as long as a cause of action is stated.  The case is taken as found and the proceeding is treated as one in the nature of mandamus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The tariff is unconstitutional in violation of the freedom of speech and association guarantees contained in the First Amendment and the comparable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  provision in sections 8 and 9 of article I of the New York State Constitution.  The recorded messages are entitled to the protection of the Constitution even if they exaggerate, vilify prominent persons and are false so long as they are not defamatory and do not incite to riot or tend to provoke immediate retaliation.  No compelling State interest warrants the identification requirement.  The State has no interest in uncovering authors of defamatory matter so as to aid potential plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Service must be restored.  The telephone company would be guilty of unjust discrimination if it could terminate service to a subscriber without valid reason and supply service to other subscribers similarly situated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Individual petitioners, who requested a transfer of service to the corporation which supplied the recorded messages, do not lack standing.  Their service was terminated prior to the transfer for noncompliance with the tariff. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator challenged a judgment from the Supreme Court in Dutchess County (New York), which dismissed his writ of habeas corpus arguing that he was not receiving the rehabilitative treatment consistent with his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate pleaded guilty to attempted grand larceny and was sentenced to a reformatory. Thereafter, he was transferred to the state hospital as insane and ultimately he was confined to prison. The inmate filed a writ of habeas corpus in which he challenged the constitutionality of his reformatory sentence. The writ was denied and the inmate appealed. Had the inmate been sentenced under N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 261, 1297, he would have already gained release. However, he was sentenced pursuant to N.Y. Correction Law &sect; 288, which provided reformatory sentences for males between ages of 21 and 30 years. The court reversed the judgment. Even though reformatory sentences were constitutional, a reformatory term inmate could not be confined for a period greater than the maximum to which a prison term inmate convicted of the same crime was subject, unless the basis for distinguishing between the two persons continued to exist. The inmate was not receiving the benefits of rehabilitation facilities and his treatment was indistinguishable from those with prison terms. Hence, his equal protection rights were violated by such a confinement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment dismissing the writ of habeas corpus was reversed and the writ was sustained to the extent that the inmate had to be afforded treatment consistent with his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- sentence to reformatory -- basis for distinguishing between felons under 30 sentenced to reformatory where rehabilitation is available and those over 30, sentenced to prison where term is shorter, is rational and sentence to reformatory is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- since relator, sentenced to reformatory for longer period, by virtue of transfer to another institution does not receive rehabilitation treatment, his writ of habeas corpus is sustained -- neither discharge nor transfer to reformatory is required by sustaining writ; he must receive treatment regardless of nature of institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Relator, then 22 years old, was convicted of a felony and sentenced&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under sections 2185 and 2195 of the former Penal Law and section 288 of the Correction Law, applicable to males between 21 and 30, to a reformatory without duration of sentence being fixed, although the maximum sentence for the same felony if made under sections 261 and 1297 of the former Penal Law would have been 2 1/2 years and relator would now have been entitled to release.  Such reformatory sentence does not violate the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution.  The ability to benefit from, and the availability of, rehabilitation facilities and treatment form a rational basis for distinguishing between persons convicted of the same offense, and the legislative determination that a distinction be made between those persons older than 30 years and those 30 years and younger is not arbitrary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Whereas the provision for reformatory sentences is constitutional as is section 6-a of the Correction Law which empowers the Commissioner of Correction to transfer inmates from one institution to another, the statutes may not, in conjunction, result in the confinement of a reformatory term inmate for a longer period unless the basis for distinguishing between the two persons&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  continues to exist.  Since here relator is not receiving the benefits of rehabilitation by virtue of an administrative transfer, his writ is sustained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Sustaining the writ does not require relator's discharge nor transfer to a reformatory. Regardless of the nature of the institution in which relator is confined, he must be afforded treatment consistent with his sentence. If none is available at the institution where he is now confined, he must be transferred to an institution where such treatment is available, or released.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the County Court, Suffolk County (New York), which certified him, as a narcotic addict, to the care and custody of the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission for an indefinite period not to exceed 36 months from the date of the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of guilty to criminal possession of a dangerous drug. A medical examination indicated that he was an addict within the definition of N.Y. Mental Hyg. &sect; 201(2). Defendant denied that he was an addict, and a hearing was held at which it was determined that he was an addict. The court reversed the judgment, holding that the facts were insufficient to establish that defendant was a narcotic addict under &sect; 201(2). The judgment was based upon the mere discovery of hypodermic needle scars on defendant's arms, coupled with his admission of prior addiction. If defendant could not have been found to be an addict within the first classification of &sect; 201(2), the alternative test of imminent danger of becoming dependent upon narcotics could have been utilized. However, before the second classification in &sect; 201(2) could be utilized, expert testimony as to the subject person's mental condition was required. Because the proof was insufficient to support a finding that defendant was a narcotic addict, the court held that he had to be resentenced on the conviction of criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the fourth degree, and not as a narcotic addict.</SPAN></P>

Nothing in &sect; 218 or the nature of the parole revocation procedure required an adversary proceeding. The hearing was neither a trial nor a judicial proceeding within the meaning of the federal or state Constitutions. It was an administrative proceeding, not judicially reviewable, where a purely discretionary determination was made.

Both parties sought review of the judgment. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for a new trial, holding that the proper interpretation was that a separate permit was required for each building because each one had to be inspected, and the expense was multiplied in proportion to the number buildings; however, because the property owner showed that the fees exceeded the village's costs by 200 percent, the proof was sufficient to overcome the presumption of the ordinance's validity. The court held that the trial court had to determine if there were additional costs of other agencies or if the ordinance was intended for use as an income-producing device and that the counterclaim could be addressed at the new trial.</SPAN></P>

After &sect; 170(5) was adopted, both husbands filed actions for divorce on the grounds that they had continuously lived apart from the wives under the separation orders. The wives filed motions to dismiss the complaints on the grounds that &sect; 170(5) was non-applicable to pre-existing judgments of separations. The supreme court granted one motion to dismiss and denied the other. The unsuccessful wife claimed that &sect; 170(5) did not apply retroactively. The unsuccessful husband claimed that &sect; 170(5) did apply retroactively. The court ruled that retroactive application of &sect; 170(5) to pre-existing orders of separation would unconstitutionally destroy the rights of the parties who had obtained separation orders and would confer authority upon the courts to dissolve a marriage without the consent of a non-guilty party who had obtained the judgment of separation and without proof of any breach of the marital contract on his part.</SPAN></P>

He was not wearing a seat belt at the time. Another fireman, who smelled of alcohol and was a little unsteady on his feet, refused a superior's order to take a blood test after he lined up on the wrong side of the fire engine. Both refusals were based on the advice of union representatives that such orders violated their constitutional rights. The court confirmed the commissioner's determinations and held that: (1) there was substantial evidence to support the determinations; and (2) there was a reasonable basis for the doctor's order to submit to a blood test because reasonable grounds existed for believing the firemen were intoxicated. There was no compulsory extraction of blood so there was no illegal search and seizure. There was nothing of a testimonial nature used to deprive the firemen of life, liberty, or property because there was no blood sample results introduced in evidence.

The first named petitioner was also charged with intoxication in violation of section 25.1.4 of the Regulations but he was acquitted of that charge.  The second petitioner was also charged with, and found guilty of, neglect of duty in violation of section 11.1.11 which required firemen&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to use safety belts. The second petitioner had failed to use his safety belt and sustained injury by falling from the fire vehicle.  The determinations made are supported by evidence of sufficient probative force.  The evidence is conclusive that each disobeyed the order to permit the taking of a blood sample, and in the case of the second petitioner that he failed to use a safety belt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The regulation forbidding firemen to indulge in or be under the influence of intoxicating liquors is reasonable, and as to each, reasonable grounds existed for a belief that each was intoxicated or under the influence of intoxicating beverages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Since petitioners refused to permit a blood test, there was no illegal search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Since there was no blood sample taken, there were no results to be introduced in evidence at the subsequent administrative hearing.  There was thus nothing of a testimonial or communicative nature used to deprive petitioners of life, liberty or property and they were not compelled to incriminate themselves in violation of their claimed constitutional privilege.  Moreover, the proceeding involved was an administrative one and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was not a criminal prosecution, and the punishment, if petitioners were found guilty of the charges, was a reprimand, a limited fine, suspension for a limited time, demotion or dismissal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. When intoxication or being under the influence of an intoxicating beverage is reasonably suspected, a blood sample test is a proper measure reasonably calculated to prove or disprove the fact.  If there be any self incrimination it can only occur when the results of such test are offered in evidence against the person charged.  That did not occur here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Human lives are or may be at stake in the performance of a fireman's work and to the extent that a blood test be reasonably and properly ordered without danger, his individual rights must yield in the interests of public safety.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, Association of the Bar of the City of New York, instituted disciplinary proceedings against respondent attorney based on charges that the attorney paid the Chairman of the New York State Liquor Authority on behalf of clients to procure favorable disposition of their matters before the Authority. The attorney argued that his grand jury testimony was inadmissible in the disciplinary proceedings because it was compelled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney argued that his testimony, given with immunity, should not have been used in the disciplinary proceeding because it violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. On appeal, the court disagreed. There was no authority proscribing the use of compelled testimony resulting from the grant of immunity in a non-criminal action or proceeding and such evidence had been specifically ruled admissible in disciplinary proceedings. Further, the fact that the investigatory leads enabling the prosecutor to elicit the attorney's testimony derived from bugging devices did not support the attorney's argument because a constitutional objection to the use of intercepted conversations obtained through such devices was personal and limited to a party to the conversation or whose premises were involved; the attorney was not a party to any of the conversations in question nor were the devices planted on his premises. Finally, there was no merit to the attorney's claim that the payments made were extorted from him and were not bribes. The evidence was clear that the attorney was a willing participant in the scheme and there was no evidence of extenuating circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court confirmed the referee's report and held that the attorney should be disbarred.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In testimony before a New York County Grand Jury, respondent attorney at law admitted that, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on five separate occasions, he had paid sums of money to a law office associate of the then Chairman of the New York State Liquor Authority on behalf of clients to procure favorable disposition of their matters before the Authority.  When first summoned before the Grand Jury, respondent refused to testify and was cited for and adjudged in contempt. He then asked permission to purge himself of the contempt charge and testify.  He now claims his Grand Jury testimony, admitted in evidence before the Referee, was forced and compelled and is incompetent and inadmissible in this proceeding against him.  The decisions in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Malloy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Hogan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (378 U.

Moreover, it has been specifically held that such evidence is admissible in a disciplinary proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The fact that the leads enabling the District Attorney to elicit respondent's Grand Jury testimony in June, 1963 may have derived from &quot;bugs&quot; during 1962 does not avail respondent, even if it be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  assumed that the &quot;bugging&quot; was illegal.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Berger</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (388 U.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Respondent was not a party to any of the conversations overheard in the &quot;bugged&quot; offices.  The objection on constitutional grounds to the use of intercepted conversations obtained through eavesdropping devices is personal and limited to a party to the conversation or whose premises are involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. His participation in the unlawful payments reflected in the charges is not that of an innocent man forced to submit to extortion.  The evidence is clear that respondent was a willing participant.  There would appear to be no extenuating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

It found that while there was discrepancy over the issue of whether the police had asked defendant if he had a gun prior to searching defendant, the search was valid as a frisk, which permitted the officer to contact or pat the outer clothing of defendant to detect by the sense of touch if defendant carried a concealed weapon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent commissioner of health (commissioner) challenged the decision of Supreme Court at Special Term in Albany County (New York), which denied its petition to dismiss petitioner company's N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 action. Through its N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding, the company sought to challenge the commissioner's order which determined that the company had violated N.Y. Pub. Health Law 1223.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its petition, the company alleged that N.Y. Pub.

Moreover, the company argued that it was the victim of discriminatory enforcement and that the commissioner's cease and desist order was arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable. The commissioner filed its motion to dismiss the company's petition on the ground that it was not timely filed because the company filed its petition more than 60 days after it issued its cease and desist order. Under N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 1244(1), the company only had 60 days to challenge the commissioner's decision. The trial court found that the company's motion was timely stating that the commissioner's order did not become final and binding until the deadline for compliance in the cease and desist order had passed. The court reversed the trial court's decision holding that the cease and desist order was final and binding on the cease and desist date set forth in the order. Moreover, the court pointed out that the company failed to file its petition within 60 days of the cease and desist date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant wife appealed from a judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term in Queens County (New York), which had granted a divorce to plaintiff husband and awarded her $ 10 per week alimony. The wife contended that the trial court improperly applied N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 170(5) retroactively, that it improperly granted a divorce to the &quot;guilty party,&quot; and that as thus construed, the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife obtained a decree of separation against the husband in 1966. Later in the year, the legislature enacted New York's first &quot;no-fault&quot; divorce law. Section 170(5) was enacted as a part of that Divorce Reform Law and added as a ground for divorce that the parties had lived apart, pursuant to a decree of separation, for two years after the granting of the decree. The husband brought his action for divorce in 1968, using &sect; 170(5) as the grounds. An amendment to &sect; 170(5) passed in 1968 clearly made the statute apply retroactively to separation decrees obtained before the effective date of the 1966 law. The court held that this amendment reflected the legislative intent that the statute should be applied retroactively. The statute made no distinction between &quot;guilty&quot; and &quot;innocent&quot; parties to a separation decree and thus was available to the husband. As thus construed, it was not unconstitutional. It did not take away any vested property right held by the wife. The court held that the alimony award was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff authority brought an original action to recover from defendant city the cost of operating its passenger train stations located within the city.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 1277 made the city responsible for the total cost of the authority's &quot;operation, maintenance and use&quot; of passenger train stations located within the city. The city argued that three of the stations were not true passenger stations because passengers could only use the stations to change trains. The court held that these stations were included within the statutory definition of &quot;passenger station.&quot; The city also argued that some of the expenses were for the operation of the railroad itself, as opposed to merely the operation of the stations. The court held that &quot;operations&quot; included whatever services were connected to the use of the stations by passengers, even though the services might have a connection with passengers' use of the railroad. Further, purely railroad activity, although conducted at a station, was not within the statutory intent. Thus, the city was responsible for the salaries of redcaps and baggagemen, for track cleaning and announcing of trains, and for the costs of a central telephone bureau allocated to the stations. It was entitled to a credit for concession rentals and redcap revenues.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 1277 of the Public Authorities Law makes the total cost to plaintiff of the &quot;operation, maintenance and use&quot; of each passenger station of any railroad facility within the City of New York a charge to be borne by the city.  Under that statute defendant city is liable for the three stations -- Penn Station, Jamaica and Flatbush.  This statute was enacted because all relief measures for the Long Island Rail Road had proved inadequate and it was intended to increase public assistance.  The statutory words &quot;passenger station&quot; mean nothing less than stations used for passengers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer sought review of two orders of the Supreme Court at Special Term in Nassau County (New York), which denied her motion for summary judgment and, on reargument, granted partial summary judgment in favor of respondent board of assessors. The taxpayer contended that the board had adopted an illegal method for assessing her real property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer owned three vacant lots. The board of assessors had for many years used a 1938 tax map to value property. In 1964 they determined to equalize the real property tax burden by assessing unimproved property at one-third of its current market value. Improved land would continue to be assessed at its 1938 value. The taxpayer contended that this method was illegal, first of all because it did not assess property at its &quot;full value,&quot; as required by N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 306, and secondly because it treated unimproved property differently from improved property. The court held that the board of assessors could assess property at a uniform percentage of its full value. It further held that the decision to assess unimproved property at a percentage of its current value was a justifiable attempt to equalize the tax burden on the property owners in the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court entered on reargument and dismissed the appeal from the prior order as rendered moot by the reargument.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Finding lack of uniformity in relationship of assessment to market value of unimproved property and improved property, respondent Board of Assessors in 1964 adopted a &quot;Current Market Value Land Map&quot; declaring that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  33 1/3% represented the fair equalized ratio of assessed value to current market value of vacant and unimproved land in the county.  This created two classes of property for assessment purposes: improved property and certain unimproved property at 1938 valuations, and all other unimproved property at one third of current market value. Section 306 of Real Property Tax Law requiring assessments to be at &quot;full value&quot; is not violated where assessment is expressed at a uniform percentage of full value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The fact that statutes (Real Property Tax Law &sect; 502, subd. 3; County Government Law of Nassau County, &sect; 603) provide that land shall be assessed separately from improvements and the assessment stated in separate columns but that only the total assessment shall be subject to judicial review did not make it illegal for the Board of Assessors to determine an equalized assessment ratio based upon the total assessment figure for improved property.  The Legislature has recognized that any separation of value for land and buildings is artificial and hypothetical. Moreover, the statutory provisions are merely directory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The statutes do not prevent respondent from lawfully assessing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  improved property at 100% of 1938 land value map valuations and unimproved property at 33 1/3% of current market value. The Board of Assessors deemed a dual approach necessary in a justifiable attempt to equalize tax burden on property owners.  Whether this was successful in regard to the instant unimproved property is a factual question to be decided after trial.  </SPAN></P>

Without a hearing and determination of the issue raised by that challenge, the sentencing court adjudged defendant a second felony offender and imposed a second-offender sentence, without prejudice to any future coram nobis application that defendant might choose to make addressed to the alleged invalidity of his prior conviction. The court held that this procedure violated N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1943. The court held that such error required reversal of the judgment.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Town of Ramapo did not have authority to enact certain local laws (Local Laws, 1967, Nos. 4 and 5 of Town of Ramapo) which imposed upon builders of one-and two-family homes in Rampapo the obligations of (a) holding in escrow, until transfer of title to the purchaser, the contract down payment received on the sale of any such premises and (b) depositing cash or an undertaking in the amount of $ 1,000 upon applying for a certificate of occupancy, to insure good workmanship and compliance with the applicable building codes and local regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The local laws were not sanctioned by general police powers vested in the town under common-law doctrine.  The residual police power reposes in the State, not in any of its political subdivisions.  A municipality can exercise police power only when it has specifically or impliedly received a delegation of such power from the State.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the County Court of Monroe County (New York) that, following the jury trial, convicted him of assault in the second degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of assault in the second degree after violently and sexually attacking the complainant. The victim asserted before the grand jury that she was raped, however, there was no physical evidence supporting the claim. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, first holding that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 2013 did not require corroboration of a consummated rape in order to convict defendant of assault. Therefore, the county court did not err when it refused to charge the jury that the lack of corroboration of the victim's testimony regarding a consummated rape mandated dismissal of the indictment. The court also ruled that the county court erred when it admitted into evidence defendant's blood-stained pants and a pair of shoes. The police seized the items after the warrantless entry int defendant's residence without first announcing their authority and purpose, in violation of N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 178 and the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. However, the court concluded that the improper admissions constituted harmless error. There was no reasonable possibility that the evidence illegally seized and improperly admitted contributed to he conviction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- assault in second degree -- defendant properly convicted of assault in second degree -- section 2013 of Penal Law requiring corroboration of testimony of female not applicable -- no testimony of consummated rape -- question whether testimony was corroborated before Grand Jury not before court -- property of defendant taken unconstitutionally -- search was unreasonable -- admission of evidence was not reversible error since it added nothing to People's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was properly convicted of assault in the second degree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 2013 of the Penal Law requiring corroboration of the testimony of the female is not applicable.  At no time during the trial did complainant testify to a consummated rape, and she repeatedly asserted that her condition at the time of the assault was such that she could not say that there had been a consummated rape. The trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury on the need for corroboration of the female's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The issue whether complainant's testimony as to rape was corroborated before the Grand Jury is not before the court.  No motion was made to inspect the Grand Jury minutes and dismiss the indictment. Whatever defendant may now assert to be a deficiency of proof before the Grand Jury, he has lost his right to challenge the indictment by not moving before judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Certain property seized from defendant was taken unconstitutionally. The search in which the evidence was taken was unreasonable.  The detectives' entry into and search of defendant's room was not authorized by a search warrant, nor had defendant consented to it since he did not know that the police officers were present when he permitted a person he knew to enter the room.  No notice of the officers' office and purpose was given before the entry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The admission, however, of the evidence is not reversible error. The evidence did not add anything to the People's case that might have contributed to the conviction.  </SPAN></P>

The supreme court denied the rent agency's motion to dismiss because the complaint presented factual questions, and the rent agency appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner had received permission in the past to adjust the figures that were used to calculate his net return on his building. The adjustments were subject to certain cut-off dates, but eight years after he bought the building, the city changed a cut-off date. The owner's request for a further rent increase was then denied. In considering his appeal, the court concluded that there were no fact questions remaining for trial and that the motion to dismiss should have been granted. With regard to the legislation's constitutionality, the court ruled that relief against the hardship cause by rent controls was only mandated when a deprivation occurred. A deprivation was not merely a reduction in income but had to amount to a taking because there was no constitutional guarantee of the preservation of a return on any property. There were also limits on any relief given, and to have the figures adjusted as the owner had been doing, the purchase had to be within a reasonably close time to the application for an adjustment. That the owner was successful in previous applications did not give him a vested interest in future success. The court concluded that the legislation was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled that the supreme court's order denying the agency's motion to dismiss the complaint was modified on the law to include a declaration that the amendment to the rent law was constitutional. The court also directed the entry of judgment to that effect.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and tenant -- rent regulation -- amendment of City Rent and Rehabilitation Law in 1967 which had effect, for purpose of computing increase in rents for fair return, of using assessed valuation rather than higher sale price is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> on theory that there was no necessity for it -- Legislature could require that sale, so that its price can be used, be close to date of application for increase in rents -- defendant's motions to dismiss complaints challenging constitutionality of amendment are denied and it is granted declaration that amendment is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In each action, plaintiff&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  purchased its property after certain cut-off dates specified in the City Rent and Rehabilitation Law and was able to obtain rent increase adjustments to enable it to obtain fair returns on its property, and in each instance it was able to use the higher purchase price, rather than the lower assessed valuation, for computing the fair return. By Local Law No. 41 of the City of New York for 1967, the cut-off date was changed to February 1, 1961.  Since plaintiffs had purchased their properties prior to such cut-off date, the computation of a fair return was based on the assessed value. The local law is not unconstitutional on the theory that there was no necessity for it because existing law covered the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Legislature has a constitutional right to impose a requirement that the sale, to justify use of the sale price in fixing a fair return, be reasonably close in time to the application for an increase, and can itself fix the period that is reasonable instead of leaving it to the administrative authority, the courts or anyone else.  That there have been applications at times where the sale was reasonably close to the cut-off date does not operate to give plaintiffs a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  vested interest in the cut-off date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The essential facts -- that the earlier statutes allowed the purchase price to be used; that it was so used; that the present statute prevents such use; and that a return based on the assessed value under the existing assessment will be less than one based on the purchase price -- are not in dispute.  Defendant is entitled to denials of its motion to dismiss the complaints, and to declarations that the amendment embraced in Local Law No. 41 is constitutional.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a child and his parent, challenged the judgment of the Supreme Court, Broome County (New York) upon an order of the court at special term that granted a motion for summary judgment filed by defendants, a board of education and a school district, dismissing plaintiffs' action for a declaratory judgment that N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2164 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that &sect; 2164, which provided that no child could have been admitted to school without a certificate of his immunization against poliomyelitis, smallpox and measles, was unconstitutional. Plaintiffs' additional and alternative argument advanced was that if the exemption accorded by N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2164(8) to children whose parents were bona fide members of a religious organization whose teachings were contrary to the practices required by N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2164 had not applied to them, it was discriminatory and otherwise constitutionally invalid. On appeal, the court affirmed summary judgment in favor of defendants. It held that statutes of such nature, and &sect; 2164 in particular, were within the police power and were thus constitutional. The court found that plaintiffs had repeatedly claimed the benefit of the exemption and that they had negated the application of &sect; 2164 by their affidavit that indicated that their religious faith had not condemned nor condoned medical immunization as required by &sect; 2164. The court concluded that plaintiffs' opposition had not been predicated upon religious grounds within the intendment of &sect; 2164.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant optometrists sought review of a judgment of the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), which dismissed their petition seeking to compel respondents, the Governor of the State of New York and a task force, to promulgate an optometric fee schedule retroactively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor promulgated a maximum medical fee schedule for each item of service to be performed by a physician for a patient who qualified for Medicaid benefits. The fee schedule was made retroactive. No comparable fee schedule for eye services performed by the optometrist was promulgated at that time. The optometrists brought an action seeking to require that when the fee schedule applying to their services was promulgated, it would also be made retroactive. The trial court dismissed the action for failure to state a cause of action. The optometrists appealed, contending that a failure to make their fee schedule retroactive, as had been done with the physicians' fee schedule, violated the equal protection and due process requirements of the United States and New York Constitutions. In affirming, the court held that the guarantee of equal protection was applicable only where the classification and discrimination were entirely arbitrary and devoid of a reasonable basis. The court found valid distinctions between the various professions that dispensed services. The court concluded that the state could validly distinguish between ophthalmologists and optometrists.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- &quot;Medicaid&quot; -- retroactive application -- failure to make &quot;Medicaid&quot; fee schedule for optometrists retroactive, where fee schedule for physicians had been made retroactive, did not violate equal protection and due process requirements of Federal and State Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the enactment of Federal and State legislation establishing the &quot;Medicaid&quot; program, the Governor promulgated a maximum medical fee schedule, retroactive to July 1, 1966, for physicians performing services for a patient who qualified for &quot;Medicaid&quot; benefits.  In a proceeding seeking to require that, when promulgated, a comparable fee schedule for eye services performed by petitioners, optometrists, also would be made retroactive to July 1, 1966, the application was properly dismissed.  The failure to make petitioners' fee schedule retroactive is not violative of the equal protection and due process requirements of the Federal and State&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Constitutions.  The State may validly distinguish between physicians and nonphysicians, and, more specifically, between ophthalmologists and optometrists. The legislation involved is not itself discriminatory nor does it treat any involved unequally. The complaint is rather with the administrative process. It is evident that, once the rates for petitioners' services had been arrived at, there were present financial and administrative considerations upon which retroactivity could validly have been rejected.  The decision to make the rates prospective cannot be said to be arbitrary and discriminatory. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After finishing certification in California, intervenors were entitled to the inscription &quot;D.O.&quot; on their professional licenses. Later, California legislation changed the certification of the college, and required that in-state practitioners already licensed chose either the &quot;M.D.&quot; or &quot;D.O.&quot; classification on their licenses. Intervenors had until that time inscribed only &quot;D.O.&quot; on their New York licenses. Intervenors requested and were granted leave to amend their licenses to include both designations. The petitioners filed a complaint that sought revocation of the dual designations and an order that required intervenors to tender their licenses to have the &quot;M.D.&quot; designations deleted. On appeal of the judgment in favor of the petitioners, the court rejected intervenors' arguments that the petitioners lacked standing because they had an interest in the regulation of the osteopathic profession. New York public policy vitiated against allowing intervenors to claim dual designations when they had not received any training or education that entitled them to any designation but &quot;D.O.&quot; The dual designations contravened the purpose of N.Y.

Upon passing medical examinations in New York State they were issued licenses containing the inscription &quot;D.O.&quot; (Education Law, &sect; 6512, subd. 3).  In 1962 the California college was converted into a nonosteopathic medical school and intervenors were permitted to submit their California licenses and have their &quot;D.O.&quot; degrees changed to &quot;M.D.&quot;.  Thereafter they submitted their New York licenses bearing &quot;D.O.&quot; inscriptions, along with their newly acquired &quot;M.D.&quot; diplomas to appellants and requested that an &quot;M.D.&quot; inscription be added to their licenses, and their names be entered in the registry of New York M.D.s.  Their licenses were amended so that the applicant's name was followed by the inscriptions &quot;D.O., M.D.&quot;.

Law &sect; 100(5) for selling liquor on credit and for refusing to answer question in an interview conducted by the SLA. The court annulled the SLA's determination. It held that there was no evidence to sustain the charge against the sore of sales on credit because the supporting evidence was obtained in violation of the store's constitutional rights. There was no warrant for the search and seizure, and the store had standing to object to the search because evidence was obtained from the coat of an officer of the store that was left for safekeeping in an area not open to the general public. The court held that the officer's refusal to answer questions in the SLA interview was not a violation of N.Y. Comp.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner, a corporation, was charged with selling liquor on credit ( Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, &sect; 100, subd. 5).  An investigator for the State Liquor Authority testified that he and another investigator visited petitioner's liquor store and that he was told by the manager of the premises that he could inspect the premises. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The investigator went into the rear room of the premises, saw there a coat belonging to an officer, director and stockholder of petitioner, and searched the pocket of the coat. This was an unreasonable search. The permission of the manager to inspect the premises could not and did not confer a right to search the personal property of another lawfully and properly on the premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner, a corporation, has standing to object to the procedure.  The coat with its contents was in the custody and safekeeping of petitioner in a portion of the premises not open to the general public.  Because of the search petitioner is or will be compelled to suspend its business and forfeit $ 1,000.  The evidence should have been excluded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city voters appealed the order of the Supreme Court of New York County (New York), which denied their request for a temporary injunction against defendants, a city clerk and a commissioner of elections.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of the plan for the creation of a new civil city court system, a specified number of new judges were created by the legislature. Pursuant to the timing of the passage of 1968 N.Y. Laws ch. 987, the new judges were to be nominated after the spring primary season had passed. Thus, under N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 131(7), the new judges were to be nominated by political parties instead of being selected in primaries. The city clerk was about ready to certify the election process for the new judgeships. The city voters claimed that the nominating process hindered the ability of minority groups to nominate or elect judges belonging to their group and that the barrier to minority power violated N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 1 and the equal protection clauses of the New York and United States Constitutions. Upon appeal, the lower court's decision was affirmed. The court held that neither &sect; 1 nor the equal protection rights of the voters were violated by 1968 N.Y. Laws ch. 987. The court ruled that that there was no constitutional requirement that judges be allocated solely on the basis of population.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Effective September 1, 1962, the New York State Constitution (art. VI) was amended to enable the Legislature to establish a single court of city-wide civil jurisdiction in New York City and provision was made for the abolition of the City Court and the Municipal Court, the transfer of the Justices thereof to the city-wide court and the choosing of the Judges of the city-wide court &quot;by the electors of the counties included within the city of New York from districts within such counties established by law&quot; (art VI, &sect; 15, subd. a).  The Legislature thereafter enacted implementing statutes which established the Civil Court of the City of New York, abolished the Municipal and City Courts, whose Justices had been elected, in the case of the Municipal Courts, from Municipal Court districts within each county in the city and, in the case of the City Courts, from each of the counties within the city, constituted said Justices Judges of the Civil Court, and provided that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a vacancy in the office of Judge of the Civil Court was to be filled, in the case of a former Justice of the Municipal Court or his successor, by the electors of the former Municipal Court district and, in the case of a former Justice of the City Court or his successor, by the electors of the county.  The latter statutes do not violate the above-quoted provision of section 15 (subd. a) of article VI of the New York State Constitution, which is construed to enable the Legislature to make provision, in its discretion, for the election and allocation of the Judges of the Civil Court, nor do they infringe the right of franchise or violate the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In 1968 (L. 1968, ch. 987), the Legislature created 25 additional judgeships for the Civil Court, mandating that these additional Judges be elected at the November, 1968 general election, to take office January 1, 1969.  This statute was signed and became effective on June 22, 1968, after the spring primary election was held.  It does not infringe the right of franchise, which may be regulated by the Legislature within reasonable limitations, or the equal protection clause of the United&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  States Constitution.  In the light of the circumstances, the nominations for these additional judicial offices may properly be made by the political parties rather than by the electors of the city.  </SPAN></P>

An adjudication as a youthful offender would have allowed defendant the following advantages: he would not have been denominated a criminal, he would not have been disqualified from public office or public employment, he would not have forfeited any right or privilege, he would not have been disqualified from receiving any license granted by public authority, and the determination would not have been deemed a conviction and would have had no effect upon future multiple offender treatment. Due to the improperly imposed condition, defendant, by maintaining his innocence, was forced to expose himself to the far more serious consequences of a judgment of conviction in order to exercise his constitutional right to trial. The court directed that defendant be afforded youthful offender treatment in any subsequent proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bakeries initiated a case against the city and sought declaratory judgments that a local law and the rules and regulations of the Department of Public Works concerning the computation of sewer surcharges declared illegal.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- surcharge on sewer rents for excess water pollution -- section 687-1.0 of Administrative Code of City of New York, enacted by Local Law No. 2 of 1961, provides for surcharge on sewer rents for those throwing excess pollutants in sewage; by rule, Commissioner of Public Works was empowered to establish industry-wide average pollutant concentration of wastes discharged into sewer system and did establish average for sweetgoods bakers; in action for declaratory judgment, judgment for plaintiffs is reversed, and case remanded for entry of stated judgment for defendant -- plaintiffs offered no proof that cost of installing individual measurement devices was unreasonable -- rule was not subject to strict construction; plaintiffs were not compelled to accept industry-wide average -- bakery investigation begun in 1961 but excess surcharge was not imposed until 1965; no retroactive application was involved -- schedule of priorities for industries investigated did not involve denial of due process</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- procedure whereby industry average of pollutants was obtained was not arbitrary -- before surcharge billed to plaintiffs, they were entitled to reduction of 40% of water found to have been absorbed in baking process -- for water derived from wells, used for refrigeration and discharged into sewer, one plaintiff was properly denied allowance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 687-1.0 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York (Local Laws, 1961, No. 2 of City of New York) provides for combating water pollution by requiring industries that contribute thereto to pay for the cost of treating sewage. A surcharge was established for pollutants in waste in excess of permissible levels in accordance with a formula.  The sewer rent is based upon the water supply to a given property.  With respect to bakeries, the Commissioner of Water Supply, Gas and Electricity determined that the average retention of water by bakeries is 40% and that a firm, by showing that it was a bakery, could reduce by that much its sewer rent and surcharge. The Commissioner of Public Works, by rule (&sect; 9.4, subd. [d]) provided that an industry-wide average pollutant concentration of the wastes discharged into the sewage system&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  shall be established for each industry and applied to a plant where the sampling is impractical.  For the sweetgoods bakers, including plaintiffs, a figure of 4,625 parts per million of excess pollutant concentration was obtained.  Plaintiffs were offered the alternative of undergoing individual sampling of their sewage but they declined.  In these consolidated actions for judgments declaring that Local Law No. 2 which enacted section 687-1.0 of the Administrative Code, and the rules pertaining to sewer surcharges is illegal, a judgment in favor of plaintiffs is reversed, and the case remanded for determination of the proper sewer surcharges to each plaintiff and for entry of a stated judgment in favor of defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Commissioner is empowered by the law to require the installation, by the regulated party and at its own expense, of equipment necessary for continuous or intermittent measurement. The regulated party, to invalidate such a law, must prove that the cost is so great as to be unreasonable.  Plaintiffs offered no evidence to show that the nonrecurring costs of the required sampling chambers were so great as to be unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The rule of strict construction of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a criminal statute is not applicable to subdivision (d) of section 9.4 of the Rules and Regulations since the administrative agency proceeded under the civil provisions of the statute.  Local Law No. 2 contemplated the adoption of such regulations. Continuous universal sampling required under a strict construction would vitiate the law.  Moreover, plaintiffs were not compelled to accept the average if they bore the costs of an individual sampling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The bakery investigation began in 1961 and continued to 1965.  It was not unreasonable to apply the industrial average from the effective date of the law.  The charges were not rendered retroactive because they were computed at a later date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. There was no denial of due process or of equal protection of the law in the establishment by the Commissioner of a schedule of priorities for testing based upon reasonable expectations as to which industries would be the heaviest polluters and proceeding thereon to investigate the wholesalers before the retailers.  The classification was reasonable and was not intentionally discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The procedures whereby the Commissioner arrived at the industry average for the sweetgoods wholesale&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  bakers were not arbitrary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. In billing plaintiffs for the surcharge, they should not have been charged for the 40% of the water found to have been absorbed in the baking process, even though plaintiffs made no application therefor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. One plaintiff was properly denied an allowance for well water used for refrigeration and air conditioning and then discharged into the sewer. It is not the source of the water that matters but the medium of disposal.  Defendant, in determining the average retention, made due allowance for the fact that water used for refrigeration does not enter into the baking process.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court affirmed the order of the state human rights commission, which found that landlords discriminated against a prospective tenant in violation of the Law Against Discrimination, N.Y. Exec. Law art. 15, &sect; 296, subd. 5, para. a, by refusing to lease an apartment to her. The landlords sought review, contending that they were entitled to deny the tenant a lease because she was undesirable tenant, and that the statute was unconstitutional because it constituted a deprivation of their property rights. The court affirmed the order. It held that the evidence adequately supported the commission's findings that the landlords had discriminated against the tenant because she was a Negro and that they thereby violated the applicable provisions of the antidiscrimination statute. The court further held that the statute was a constitutional exercise of the state's police power.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The evidence supports the findings of the State Commission for Human Rights that appellants discriminated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  against complainant in the rental of an apartment in a three-apartment dwelling because she was a Negro, thereby violating the Law Against Discrimination (Executive Law, art. 15).  The refusal of the accommodations was not based on other standards of acceptability such as ability to pay rent, number of children in the family, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Appellants' exercise of the right to withdraw the apartment from the rental market and to occupy it themselves was tainted with bad faith since it was exercised after the commission's findings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landlord brought an action against respondent, Department of Buildings of the City of New York, to declare unconstitutional the Emergency Repair Program authorizing repairs without the consent of the landlord and to collect rents for the payment of the repairs. The Supreme Court at Special Term in New York County (New York) entered judgment in favor of the department and dismissed the petition. The landlord appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A tenant unsuccessfully attempted to get the landlord to fix a stopped up toilet that was causing an overflow of waste. She then went to the department, which corrected the problem. The department billed the landlord for the cost of the repair and the landlord brought the action. The landlord argued he did not know of the problem until he received the bill and that such problems were the responsibility of the tenant. The landlord argued his constitutional rights were violated because he had no opportunity to contest the necessity for the repair work. The court affirmed the dismissal of the petition and found the program was constitutional. The court found the condition constituted a health hazard and that summary abatement of such nuisances was a long established principle that was not abrogated by the state constitution. Pursuant to the police powers, the department had the authority to recover expenses incurred for matter essential to public health or safety. The court found no equal protection violation in the selection of one class of landlords for the program because the end sought was legitimate and the measures taken reasonable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- health hazards in multiple dwellings -- &quot;Emergency Repair Program&quot; which authorizes respondent Department of Buildings of City of New York to make repairs of conditions hazardous to health in multiple dwellings without landlord's consent and collect rents in payment is constitutional -- designation of respondent as agency to make repairs properly made by Board of Health and Mayor -- summary abatement of health hazard does not constitute forfeiture of owner's property -- provision imposing charge for repairs against owner and lien upon rent is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The &quot;Emergency Repair Program&quot; which authorizes respondent Department of Buildings of the City of New York to make repairs with respect to health hazards in multiple dwellings&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  without the permission and consent of landlord or lienors and to collect the rents in payment therefor should landlord fail to reimburse the city is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Pursuant to chapter 22 of the Administrative Code, a resolution of the Board of Health dated January 29, 1965 and an executive order of the Mayor, respondent was designated by the Department of Health to effect repairs to conditions constituting a health hazard and nuisance in buildings.  Nuisances may be abated by the Department of Health or any agency of the City of New York designated by it as its agent (Administrative Code, ch.  22, &sect; 556-10.0) and the board could properly designate or approve the designation of respondent as the agency to abate the nuisance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The summary abatement of a condition which constituted a health hazard cannot be considered as the imposition of punishment upon the owner, or as the forfeiture of the owner's right of property.  The burden of showing unconstitutionality has not been met by petitioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The charge for correcting the condition is a joint and several charge against the owners, lessees or occupants of the apartment and the expenses are or may be a lien against rent (Administrative&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Code, &sect; 564-22.0) or a lien upon land or buildings.  Such a provision is constitutional.  It is neither unreasonable nor discriminatory that reimbursement is sought first from the owner.  Selectivity in enforcement founded upon a rational basis is not arbitrary.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court confirmed the Commissioner's determination. The teacher appealed, contending the agreement was invalid as a waiver of tenure rights and as violative of the constitutional prohibition of gifts of public funds. The court disagreed, holding that: (1) a teacher, like any other employee, could resign; (2) for consideration the teacher waived his right to a hearing; (3) the money agreed to be paid constituted a valid compromise of a legal dispute, entered into at arm's length by adult parties represented by counsel; and (4) the school board had the right to negotiate a settlement in avoidance of expensive and uncertain litigation in the best interests of the taxpayers of the school district.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant challenged a decision from the Workmen's Compensation Board, which held that the claimant did not have an occupational loss of hearing within the meaning of art. 3-A of the Workmen's Compensation Law. The claimant had filed a claim for workmen's compensation benefits alleging an industrial loss of hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A claimant retired after 44 years of employment for his employer. Two years later, he filed a claim for industrial loss of hearing under art. 3-A of the Workmen's Compensation Law. The Board found that he did not have a compensable loss of hearing because his hearing loss was outside of the frequency range used for conversational speech and that the criteria prescribed for the measurement and for the determination of hearing loss were highly salutary and eminently reasonable. On appeal, the court held that: (1) art. 3-A, which provided an adequate method for the measurement of the impairment or establishment of the relationship of an impairment with the employment, was not unconstitutional because there was a reasonable basis for the enactment thereof, which was neither arbitrary nor illegal; and (2) section 44-gg of the Law, which established that loss of hearing should be based upon conversational hearing, was not unconstitutional as applied to the claimant, and the fact that a person suffering loss of hearing from a traumatic injury was entitled to benefits where the same loss of hearing under art. 3-A of the Law was not compensable did not make art. 3-A unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the Board's decision denying the claimant's application for workmen's compensation benefits for an industrial hearing loss.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Workmen's compensation -- occupational loss of hearing -- Article 3-A of Workmen's Compensation Law providing compensation for occupational loss of hearing resulting from noise is constitutional -- section 49-gg of article is constitutional as applied to claimant whose loss of hearing, board found, was outside range of conversational hearing and not compensable -- that compensation is given for loss of such hearing if resulting from trauma does not make law </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- no unlawful delegation of legislative authority involved in section 49-gg which provides for reliance on report of Committee of Consultants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Article 3-A of the Workmen's Compensation Law, entitled &quot;Occupational Loss of Hearing&quot;, relating solely to loss of hearing resulting from employment where the employee is exposed to harmful noise, is constitutional.  There was a reasonable basis for its enactment which was neither arbitrary nor illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 49-gg of such article directs that expert recommendations be secured and authorizes the board to adopt reasonable rules prescribing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  standards for the measurement and determination of occupational loss of hearing. A Committee of Consultants made a report containing a formula for the determination of hearing loss. The formula set the tonal ranges for the hearing levels of conversational speech and the method of computing the percentage of loss within such ranges for the purpose of schedule losses.  The board adopted the report and adopted rules which set forth such formula for the determination of hearing loss. Such section is not unconstitutional as applied to claimant who, the Workmen's Compensation Board found, did not have an occupational loss of hearing because under the formula, his loss of hearing was outside the frequency range used for conversational speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. That a person suffering loss of hearing as a result of a traumatic injury is entitled to benefits where the same loss of hearing under article 3-A is not compensable does not make the law unconstitutional because of unfairness or discrimination.</SPAN></P>

There was no unlawful delegation of legislative authority in section 49-gg by the provision for the recommendations by experts, and pending the adoption of rules by the board, that the report of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Committee of Consultants should be the basis for determining standards and criteria of occupational loss of hearing. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of soliciting in a public place on behalf of another for immoral purposes; that was, prostitution. Defendant argued that the words &quot;solicit&quot; and &quot;immoral&quot; did not adequately inform men subject to the penalties what acts it was their duty to avoid. The court affirmed. The court held that the question to be resolved was not whether the words &quot;solicit&quot; and &quot;immoral&quot; taken in the abstract were impermissibly vague and indefinite, but rather whether the verbiage of the whole statutory provision was sufficiently definite, clear, and positive to give unequivocal warning to citizens of the rule that was to be obeyed. The court reasoned that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1148 provided that every person who lived wholly, or in part, on the earnings of prostitution committed by another, or who, in any public place, solicited on behalf of another for immoral purposes, was guilty of a misdemeanor. A person who lived with or was habitually in the company of a prostitute and had no visible means of support, should be presumed to be living on the earnings of prostitution.

There was no appeal directly from the order of dismissal, and the court held that the newly enacted provisions of N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 3216 did not apply retroactively to require vacatur thereof.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landmark preservation commission sought review of an order from the Supreme Court for New York County (New York), which, in a N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding, granted an application to annul the commission's determination that designated appellee trustees' property as landmarks and landmark sites.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustees' institution was a charitable organization whose main activity was to provide a home for retired seafaring men beyond the age of active duty. On a tract of land there were five buildings that were used as dormitories and those buildings were the subject of the commission's determination. On review the court reversed because the trial court was not supplied with sufficient facts. The court noted that there was evidence that the buildings were one of the two best examples of Greek revival architecture in the country. The court noted that the test in determining a taking of charity property was where maintenance of the landmark either physically or financially prevented or seriously interfered with carrying out the charitable purpose. The court had to determine whether the preservation of the buildings seriously interfered with the use of the property, whether the buildings were capable of conversion to a useful purpose without excessive cost, or whether the cost of maintaining them without use would have entailed serious expenditure.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- preservation of landmarks -- State may constitutionally restrict use of property for aesthetic benefit of community -- petitioner charitable corporation's 19th century buildings for housing retired seamen have been declared special landmarks and petitioner may not tear them down and construct new buildings; under applicable </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; 207-8.0) court may grant relief to charity where maintenance of landmark interferes with carrying on charitable purpose; matter remanded for determination</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> of stated factual questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The State has the right, where constitutionally guaranteed rights are not infringed, to place restrictions on the use to be made by an owner of his property for the cultural and aesthetic benefit of the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner, a charitable organization, operates a home for retired seamen in five buildings constructed in the 19th century.  It intends to tear them down and construct modern buildings.  The Landmarks Preservation Commission has determined that the old buildings are of a special character and therefore petitioner may not reconstruct or demolish them without obtaining the commission's permission. Chapter 8-A of the Administratives Code of the City of New York in section 207-8.0 provides guidelines as to what constitutes an undue burden on commercial property but in regard to property devoted to charitable uses the guidelines are limited to the instances where the institution desires to alienate the property by sale or lease.  The statute is not thereby rendered unconstitutional but must be interpreted as giving power to the commission to provide relief in the situation covered by the statute but not restricting the court from so doing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in others.  The criterion for relief as to a charity would be where maintenance of the landmark either physically or financially prevents or seriously interferes with carrying out the charitable purpose. The answer thus depends on whether the preservation of the buildings seriously interferes with the use of the property, whether the buildings are capable of conversion to a useful purpose without excessive cost, or whether the cost of maintaining them without use would entail serious expenditure, all in the light of petitioner's purposes and resources.  The matter is remanded for further consideration of these factual questions.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant theater operator sought review of an order from the Supreme Court, Erie County (New York), which denied its motion to dismiss plaintiff city's complaint. The city had alleged that there was a licensing ordinance and had requested that the theater owner be enjoined and restrained from operating in violation of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was conceded that the theater operator was conducting such a business, was not licensed to do so, and had never even applied for such a license. The theater operator had sought to dismiss the complaint against it for failure to state a claim. The motion was denied and the theater operator subsequently appealed. On review, the critical issue was whether the city's licensing ordinance, which required that all &quot;drive-in theaters&quot; conducted in the city by licensed by the mayor, was constitutional. There were no standards, policies, or rules set forth to control or guide the discretion of the mayor. The matter was left entirely to him, and he might license or not as he saw fit, for any reason or for no reason. In reversing, the court noted that similar legislative provisions repeatedly had been held to be unconstitutional delegations of legislative authority. The court further noted that a reasonable amount of discretion could be delegated to an administrative official, but not an unreasonable and wholly unrealistic and unlimited amount. Therefore, because the discretion vested in the mayor under the ordinance was unrestricted, the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order of the Supreme Court at Special Term of Cayuga County (New York), which dismissed, without a hearing, an application for a writ of habeas corpus. Defendant was convicted of assault in the second degree with the intent to commit the felony sodomy and was sentenced to one day to life pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 243.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Previously, the court reversed an order of a county court denying defendant's application for a writ of error coram nobis, vacated the sentence, and remanded for resentencing. Defendant's resentence was affirmed. Defendant asserted that: (1) the resentence should be vacated for failure of compliance with N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 2189-a; (2) that he had not been given, while serving his sentence, any therapeutic care or treatment or rehabilitation procedure of a psychiatric nature; (3) and that the imposition of the one day to life sentence based on hearsay without giving him an opportunity to be heard or to confront witnesses, violated constitutional requirements of due process. On appeal, the court found that while it was true that a prior writ was dismissed after a hearing, the issue presented on such application was not similar to the issues presented. The court held that no reason appeared for affording additional review of the resentencing procedures except as the issue of violation of constitutional requirements of due process was raised. The court noted that adequate psychological and psychiatric services were indispensable to the whole concept of &quot;one day to life&quot; sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court unanimously reversed the order, granted the application, and remitted the matter to the supreme court for a full hearing dealing with the extent of the psychological and psychiatric treatment given defendant since the imposition of the sentence. The court also ordered that defendant should further be given a complete psychiatric examination by two duly qualified psychiatrists to determine whether it would be dangerous to release him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- sentence -- appeal process provided full opportunity for reviewing issue of compliance with section 2189-a of Penal Law -- failure of sentencing court to afford relator opportunity to be heard and to confront witnesses before imposing sentence was not denial of due process -- relator entitled to hearing as to extent of psychological and psychiatric treatment given him since incarceration and to examination to determine whether he can rejoin society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Relator, who had been sentenced to one day to life, was remanded for resentencing and again sentenced to one day to life.  This resentence was affirmed by the Appellate Division and permission to appeal to the Court of Appeals was denied.  That appeal process provided a full opportunity for review of the issue of compliance with section 2189-a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Penal Law at resentencing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The failure of the sentencing court to afford defendant an opportunity to be heard and confront witnesses before imposing the one day to life sentence was not a denial of due process (cf.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Williams </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> New York</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 337 U.S. 241).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In view of the allegations of the petition that relator has not been given any therapeutic care or treatment and that no rehabilitative procedures have been followed through his 15 years of incarceration, which relator was not given an opportunity to support at an evidentiary hearing, the matter should be remitted for a full hearing dealing with the extent of the psychological and psychiatric treatment given relator since the imposition of sentence upon him.  He should further be given a complete psychiatric examination by two duly qualified psychiatrists to determine whether it would be dangerous to release him, and whether he is now capable of rejoining society.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant New York State Athletic Commission challenged the denial of its motion to dismiss respondent wrestler's petition, which sought to annul the Commission's refusal to issue a professional wrestling license. The appeal was by permission of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), from trial court orders denying motions to dismiss the petition for insufficiency and to change venue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission denied the wrestler's application to wrestle on the basis that state law did not permit women to wrestle or be licensed. The trial court denied the Commission's motions to dismiss the wrestler's petition. The appellate court referred the matter to the court, which reversed the trial court's order denying the motion to dismiss the petition. The court found that the principal issue was whether there had been a valid delegation of legislative power to the Commission to determine whether the application by a female for a wrestling license would be consistent with the public interest, convenience, or necessity, and with the best interests of wrestling generally. The court found that the delegation of power to the Commission was valid. A great deal of latitude and discretion was to be accorded the Commission, which was responsible to the people of the State of New York for the maintenance of fair dealing, honesty, and clean sport in a field which had in the past been infested with undesirable elements. The Commission's rules were to be enforced unless shown to be clearly arbitrary. The rule that women could not obtain a wrestling license was not clearly arbitrary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order denying the motion to dismiss the petition. The motion was granted and the petition was dismissed. The court dismissed, as academic, the appeal from the order determining venue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Licenses -- women wrestlers -- delegation of authority to State Athletic Commission to control wrestling under reasonable standards is valid, and denial of license to woman wrestler under commission's rules was proper exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Athletic Commission was given &quot;the sole direction, management, control and jurisdiction&quot; over licenses to hold wrestling matches or exhibitions within New York State and over licenses to persons to participate in wrestling matches or exhibitions (L. 1953, ch. 137, amdg. L.  1920, ch. 912, &sect; 6) in accordance with standards set forth (L. 1952, ch.  666, &sect; 11, amdg. L. 1920, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ch. 912, &sect; 12) that a license be granted in its judgment if the &quot;character and general fitness of an applicant * * * are such that the participation of such applicant will be consistent with the public interest, convenience or necessity and with the best interest of * * * wrestling generally&quot;.  Such standards are definite and reasonable and the delegation of power to the commission is valid.  Accordingly, the denial of a professional wrestling license to a woman under a rule of the commission (19 NYCRR 205.15) that no women may compete in any wrestling contest or exhibition and be licensed as a wrestler was a reasonable exercise of the police power of the State.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ordered defendant released, holding unconstitutional &sect; 206, which provided that upon defendant's apprehension he could be brought immediately to the reception center for physical examination. The court determined that there was no prejudice to defendant by the provision that he be brought for medical examination prior to a hearing because such a hearing would have served no useful purpose unless there was an examination to determine whether he should have been further detained. The court noted that none of defendant's rights were lost because the assignment of counsel, after his medical examination, assured him every opportunity to assert any and all constitutional rights appropriate under the circumstances. The court concluded that the statements made by defendant were not of a nature that would have abridged his rights against self-incrimination. The court determined that while the legislature should have made provision for the immediate appearance of defendant before the court after apprehension, the failure to do so did not constitute an infirmity as to declare the &sect; 206 to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order and judgment of the trial court and directed that defendant be returned to the custody of the Commission for such treatment as the act provided.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Mental health -- drug addiction -- amendments to Mental Hygiene Law with respect to treatment and detention of narcotic addicts constituted valid and proper exercise of State's police power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The 1966 amendments to the Mental Hygiene Law, with respect to the treatment and detention of narcotic addicts, were a valid and proper exercise of the State's police power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 206 of the Mental Hygiene Law directs that the alleged addict, after apprehension, be taken for medical examination prior to his appearance in court for a hearing.  This provision does not violate the constitutional rights of one&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  so apprehended. The warrant authorizing apprehension of an alleged addict may be issued only after a Judge or Justice has examined the petition and determined that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person on whose behalf the application is made is a narcotic addict. (Mental Hygiene Law, &sect; 206, subd. 2, par. a.) The procedure authorized by the act is similar to that where an ordinary warrant of arrest is issued by a Judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Failure to advise him of his rights and to have counsel assigned to him did not in any way prejudice the alleged addict. The assignment of counsel, after his medical examination, assured him every opportunity to assert any and all of his constitutional rights that would be appropriate in the circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Furthermore, even if there were any defect in not assigning counsel prior to the alleged addict's medical examination, there was no justification to release him because, with the protection of counsel, and in accordance with the provisions of the law, he was found to be a narcotic addict, first by a court sitting alone, and again at a trial with a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Statements made during the period of his examination, which were admitted in evidence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  during the subsequent hearings, were not of a nature that would abridge the alleged addict's rights against self incrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Moreover, if there is to be a system of compulsory treatment, a medical examination must be had, whether before or after assignment of counsel, and no medical examination can be complete, or can serve any useful purpose unless the alleged addict responds to questions that are essential in order to make a proper diagnosis.  Consequently, the taking of these statements, without advice of counsel, and the use of them during the hearings, do not prejudice or violate the rights of the alleged addict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The evidence overwhelmingly established that he was an addict within the meaning of the law.  Even if evidence, which it is claimed was unlawfully obtained, were eliminated, there is sufficient remaining to support the conclusion that he is an addict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. In no event should the act, which has a severability clause, fall in its entirety.  It should be permitted to stand if, after excising the portion of the act deemed to be unconstitutional, the remainder carries out the objectives of the Legislature.  </SPAN></P>

The predicate of the finding was a general military court-martial, which had resulted in a conviction of defendant for assault with intent to commit murder. At the court-martial haring, defendant was represented by two young officers, both without any legal training at all. He was found guilty, dishonorably discharged, and confined to hard labor. He contended that the court-martial conviction was under circumstances which did not afford him a fair trial as contemplated by the Constitution of the United States, not having been represented by an attorney, and as such, it was an infirm support for a finding that he was a second felony offender, and therefore he should be resentenced as a first felony offender. The court held that the procedures pursuant to which defendant was convicted were not consonant with any modern or fair concept of due process. The retrospective nature of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1943 required that the denial of resentence be reversed and that defendant be resentenced without regard to his prior court-martial conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the movie licensing provisions of N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 120 et seq. were held void as violating the Fourteenth Amendment, the claimant filed a claim for the refund of fees paid pursuant to those provisions. The state argued that the licensing fees were voluntarily paid without protest and thus were not recoverable. The court affirmed the denial of the state's motion to dismiss the claimant's action. The claimant would have been prevented from earning a livelihood unless it paid the fee, and thus paid the fee under duress and not voluntarily. The court also rejected the state's argument that the claimant's cause of action accrued when it made the payments. The claimant effectively had no tribunal in which to bring its action until the movie licensing provisions were held void. Until the provisions were held void, there was no competent tribunal in which the claimant could have asserted its claim for recovery of the fees. Therefore, the statute of limitations did not commence to run until the provisions were held void.</SPAN></P>

State of New York (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">299 N. Y. 295)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> distinguished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Claimant paid license fees, without protest, pursuant to the movie licensing provisions of section 120, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., of the Education Law, which provisions were held void on June 10, 1965, as violative of the Fourteenth Amendment.  On November 24, 1965, claimant filed a notice of claim with the Court of Claims and in December, 1965, filed a claim&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  seeking refund of fees paid pursuant to the licensing provisions.  The Court of Claims properly denied the State's motion to dismiss the claim on the ground that it fails to state a cause of action or alternatively to dismiss that portion of the claim which relates to payments made before May 24, 1965 on the ground that the Court of Claims lacks jurisdiction.  There was no statutory requirement that payment be made under protest, and since the claimant had to pay the license fees to stay in business, and did so solely for that reason, the fees were involuntarily paid under duress and were recoverable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Claimant is not precluded from recovery under subdivision 4 of section 10 of the Court of Claims Act because it did not file a notice of claim within six months of its last payment.  The claimant effectively had no tribunal in which to bring the action prior to June 10, 1965, when the provisions were held unconstitutional.  The six-month Statute of Limitations did not commence to run until that date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The instant case is distinguishable from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Guaranty Trust Co. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> State of New York</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (299 N. Y. 295) which held that the cause of action for the return of payments made pursuant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to a void statute accrued at the time such payments are made.  In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Guaranty</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, suit could have been brought in the Court of Claims despite the ancillary presence of a constitutional issue, while here suit could not be initially brought in the Court of Claims because of the presence of a constitutional issue which was separate and distinct from the monetary recovery. The test is whether the constitutional issue is ancillary to an action for monetary recovery or vice versa.  Here, claimant's only avenue of approach was to proceed first in the Supreme Court to have the licensing statute voided and then, if successful, to seek refund in the Court of Claims.  This procedure would not provide relief as a practical matter since the statutory period for filing a claim would have elapsed in most instances.  Thus, claimant effectively had no tribunal in which to bring its action until June 10, 1965.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents challenged an apportionment plan based on weighted voting, and the lower court found the plan to be unconstitutional. The Board appealed, and the court modified but affirmed the lower court's order. The court stated that any weighted voting system was unconstitutional not by virtue of the amount of weight assigned but by virtue of the existence of any weighting whatsoever. Such systems did not comport with the constitutional requirement of one vote per person, the court indicated. The court stated that district representation was the only practical method to constitutionally accomplish reapportionment. District representation avoided the pitfalls of weighting, could conform to new federal census data, and minimized changes in district population, the court explained.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant town challenged an order of the trial court (New York) denying its motion to dismiss plaintiff sewerage corporation's complaint. The motion was made pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3211(a). The corporation sought a declaratory judgment that the town's ordinance was unconstitutional and asked that the trial court strike the town's action from its records. In the alternative, the corporation asked the court to appoint a condemnation commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A special sewage district was formed in the town. Shortly thereafter the corporation was formed to service an area of the town in which a summer housing development was located. Only a fraction of the area had been developed. In 1960 the town board passed a resolution pursuant to N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect;&sect; 451, 452 providing for an annual sewerage charge for each plat in the area and consenting to the formation of the corporation. In 1965, following the receipt of the petition, the town board passed another resolution that stated that when the 1960 resolution was passed it was the town's intent to only charge sewer rent to those building plots connected to and making use of the sewerage facilities. The corporation argued that the 1965 action was unconstitutional in that it deprived the corporation of property without due process of law. Reversing, the court held that the town's motion to dismiss should have been granted. The court held that the 1960 resolution was illegal and void if it was the intent of the ordinance to charge property owners not using the sewerage system. Hence the 1965 resolution could not have deprived the corporation of something that it never legally acquired.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voter filed an action, seeking summary judgment declaring that the Board was unconstitutionally elected or appointed, and declaring that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 202 was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the voter's motion for summary judgment and granted the Board's motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the complaint failed to state a cause of action. Affirming, the court found that &sect; 202 did not violate N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 4 because the Board was excepted from the provision requiring appointment by the governor with the advice and consent of the senate. The voter's contention that the election of the Board failed to comply with the one man one vote rule mandated by the Equal Protection Clause was untenable because the members were not elected. The voter's vote was not diluted any more than any other voter because none were allowed to vote for members of the Board. There was no constitutional requirement on the legislature to place any geographical limitations on the selection of any members of the Board. The Board was not a general elective organ.

Section 202 of the Education Law, which provides that the Board of Regents shall be composed of 15 members elected by the New York State Legislature, one of whom shall be chosen from each of the State's 11 Judicial Districts, with 4 chosen at large, does not violate section 4 of article V of the New York State Constitution which provides for the appointment by the Govrnor of the heads of certain State departments.

Appellant, as Chairman of the Workmen's Compensation Board of the State of New York, made assessments based on the total compensation payments respondent made, refusing to allow a deduction of the amount of the recoupment payments.

Respondent as the last employer, was required to pay the entire award. Ultimate responsibility rested on all the employers involved in the ratio of the apportionment provided by &sect; 44.

The owners argued that the section tended to eliminate competitive bidding and thus received a reduced offer, but the court noted that they did not show that there were competitors who would have bid. The court determined that severance of the counterclaims was permissible, and within the trial court's discretion, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice under N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the apple growing industry was subject to regulation by the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets (commissioner), and the use of the disjunctive &quot;or&quot; in N.Y.

The court determined, however, that the assessment was not a tax at all, but a fund-raising measure incidental to a valid regulation. The court held that the wisdom of the marketing order and the equitability of its application were administrative matters outside the scope its power to review in an action for a declaratory judgment, and it found that the apple growers assertions of illegality could not be sustained.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The apple-growing industry bears sufficiently on the public interest to be subject to State regulation and control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The means selected by the Commissioner to provide advertising, promotion and publicity programs designed to create new markets for apples, to maintain existing ones, to carry on marketing research and to keep growers informed of various aspects of the industry -- all within the contemplation of the grant of power contained in paragraph (d) of subdivision (2) of section 294 of the Agriculture and Markets Law -- were not so unrelated to the conditions of &quot;unreasonable and unnecessary economic waste of the agricultural wealth of this state&quot;, the existence of which the enactment of article 25 was designed to correct (Agriculture and Markets Law, &sect; 292), as to be considered arbitrary and violative of due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Paragraph (d) of subdivision (2) of section 294 of the Agriculture and Markets Law does not require all persons mentioned in the statute, i.e., producers, processors, distributors or handlers, to pay a part of the assessment to defray the cost and expenses of the administration of the marketing order.  The Legislature's use of the disjunctive &quot;or&quot; makes clear that it was intended to leave to the discretion of the Commissioner the selection of the class upon which the assessment should fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The assessment imposed by the Commissioner here involved is not a tax but a fund-raising measure incidental to a valid regulation and this is true even though the assessment may be the &quot;heart&quot; of the regulatory order.  The expenditure of the funds raised redounds primarily to the benefit of appellant and of all other apple producers from an anticipated expansion of markets for their product.  That other classes involved in apple marketing may also be benefited is or could be found to be incidental.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The posted notices and the newspaper and radio publicity which the referendum received together with the instructions given to all County Agricultural Agents in the State to place the notice of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the referendum in the hands of growers, which presumably were followed or at least not shown to have been disregarded, were, in the absence of an established list of persons engaged in apple growing which rendered the giving of personal notice a practical impossibility, reasonably calculated under all of the circumstances to apprise interested persons of the upcoming referendum and thus measured up to the quality which the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution requires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The declaration in the statute that the proceeds of the assessment are not to be considered State funds (Agriculture and Markets Law, &sect; 294, subd. [8]) fortified by the fact that the assessments were not exacted by the use of the taxing power of the State negates the contention that the Commissioner was handling public money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The payments to apple growers associations for services to be performed cannot be deemed a gift in any sense since they were made in reimbursement for services performed pursuant to subsisting contracts.  The provisions of section 174 of the State Finance Law have no application to contracts of this character.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A town voted to join the County police district. At the time of the vote, the town's contained unincorporated areas. Two areas within the town then incorporated into a Village. The Village wanted to withdraw from the County police district in order to establish its own police department. The Village and its treasurer initiated an action, claiming &sect;&sect; 201 and 203 were invalid. The trial court found that &sect; 203 was invalid because it violated the one-man, one-vote principle, but that it did not invalidate the rest of the County Charter. The trial court then dismissed the action. In affirming the decision, the court found that the town's election to join the County police district was binding on the Village. By subsequently incorporating, the Village residents did not acquire the right to a second vote on whether or not to join the County police district. The court reasoned that a second vote would give the Village residents unequal and greater rights than the residents of any other town or village.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the applicant's request to compel appellants to grant permission to use the court house.

However, the application was not made by the NRP, nor did the petition allege that it was a political party. Even if it were, the permit would not have to be granted if the expression of the NRP's views would immediately and irreparably create injury to the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent social welfare department (department) appealed from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Monroe County at a Trial Term (New York), which directed the department to process a filing by petitioner applicants for the operation of a nursing home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the delay in processing the application was caused by certain other facts that none of the parties has emphasized and as to which the trial court made no findings. The land upon which the nursing home was to be constructed was zoned such that the proposed building violated the permissible use in such a zone. These impediments required the granting of a variance by the zoning board. After the first hearing the request was denied but was granted following a second hearing, the day before a new law, 1964 N.Y. Laws ch. 730, became effective. The court found that this procedural issue was the proximate cause of the delay and not any act of the applicants. The granting of a variance was an obvious condition precedent to further action. Because the erection of the nursing home was prohibited by the zoning regulation, the court reversed the judgment for the applicants and dismissed the petition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A judgment that petitioners' application to operate a private proprietary nursing home be processed by the State Department of Social Welfare in accordance with the Social Welfare Law and the department's rules and regulations as they existed before October 1, 1964, the effective date of amendments (L. 1964, ch. 730) to the statute imposing further prerequisites to the establishment of such nursing homes, should be reversed.  The trial court erred in concluding that various documents, demanded by the department in June, 1964 under the then effective statute and rules but never submitted by the applicants, such as certificates of incorporation and of doing business under an assumed name, the applicants' partnership agreement, and certain leases, were not required to be filed and that revised construction plans were timely filed on September 25, 1964 so that the department&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with due diligence could have approved the application before October 1, 1964.  The trial court found that such papers were not executed because applicants deemed further action futile following the department's advising their attorney on September 4, 1964 of a July 28, 1964 resolution of the Board of Social Welfare reciting that applications received after July 31, 1964 could not be processed in regular order before October 1, 1964 and should, therefore, be processed in accordance with the new law. However, the petitioners' application had previously been given preferential treatment in both the Rochester and Albany offices of the department which had indicated that it saw no reason why the plans should not be approved.  Moreover, it is apparent that the proximate cause of the delay in executing and filing the documents was not any act of the department but the applicants' failure to obtain the local zoning board's approval of the variance required for construction of the building planned on the proposed site until September 30, 1964 -- the day before the new law became effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The 1964 amendment (L. 1964, ch. 730) of the Social Welfare Law, requiring an applicant for approval&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the operation of a nursing home to establish the &quot;need&quot; for such new facility, was not unconstitutional as an unreasonable exercise of the police power. The legislation resulted from an exhaustive study by a joint legislative committee, and it is recognized that the operation of nursing homes bears a reasonable relation to the health, safety and welfare of a community and is subject to licensing and regulation as a valid exercise of the police power. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted in Florida of aggravated assault in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 784.04. Upon conviction in New York, the trial court sentenced him as a second felony offender based on the Florida conviction. He filed a motion for resentence, which the trial court treated as one for coram nobis relief. The trial court denied relief, holding that the Florida crime would have been a felony in New York and that the contention of unlawful deprivation of counsel had to be made in Florida. On appeal, the court agreed that the application was one for coram nobis relief and that the Florida crime would have been a felony in New York. However, the court reversed, disagreeing with the trial court's finding that petitioner had to make his claim of deprivation of counsel in the Florida proceedings in the courts of that State. That assertion could be made in a coram nobis proceeding in New York under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1943, and if it were sustained, it was not correct to use the Florida conviction as the predicate for a second-offender sentence. Petitioner made a sufficient prima facie showing of a deprivation of counsel in the Florida proceedings to require a hearing on that issue.</SPAN></P>

The first landowner had a long-term lease of the second landowner's property and sought to construct on both parcels a building containing offices for rent and a school. The city refused to issue construction permits because part of the proposed building was to be constructed in the street proposed in the ordinance. The trial court held that the ordinance and N.Y. Gen. Cities Law &sect; 35 were unconstitutional as applied to the landowners because erecting a building of the same size outside the proposed street bed would cost more than the proposed building. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the building restriction did not result in a taking of the landowners' property without compensation. The court reasoned that the increased cost of constructing the same size building outside the proposed street bed was nominal and the widening of the street was necessary due to increased use and congestion. The court noted that the landowners had been negotiating with the city in an attempt to sell the portion of their land within the proposed street bed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 35 of the General City Law forbids the issuance of a permit for building in the bed of a mapped street laid out in a plan.  Defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  city's street plan, as amended in 1963, requires plaintiff corporations, which propose to build on one such street, to set back the construction 14 feet so as to permit later widening of the street by 14 feet. Plaintiffs' evidence fails to rebut the presumption of constitutionality of the section and of the street plan as applied to their land.  The city's requirement of a 14-foot setback is a valid exercise of the police power and consonant with sound city planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Moreover, reasonable and profitable use can be had of plaintiffs' property by setting the proposed building back 14 feet at an increase of 6% in the construction cost with little or no loss in rental income. Such extra cost is trivial damage compared to the great injury to the general welfare which will result if the city is prevented from planning for this essential improvement in traffic conditions.  </SPAN></P>

The county adopted Nassau County, N.Y., Local Laws No. 1 (1956), a local law imposing a 30 percent tax on admissions to harness horse race meetings within the county.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent county appealed the decision from the Supreme Court in Erie County (New York), which entered judgment in favor of petitioner village in its action to direct the county to pay a portion of the proceeds from a sales and use tax imposed by the county. The dispute required an interpretation of the county tax and a state enabling act, 1947 N.Y. Laws ch. 278, as amended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village was located partially in the county and partially in another county. The enabling act allowed the use tax to be applied to the village instead of directly reducing property taxes. The question was whether the village was entitled to the entire tax benefit or only for that portion residing in the county. The court reversed. Under 1947 N.Y. Laws ch. 278, &sect; 4, the tax only had an application within the territorial limits of the county or city imposing the tax. The court reasoned that that language indicated that the tax could only be applied within the portion of the village in the county. The court looked to other sections of the enabling act, particularly regarding the division of taxes for school purposes, to support its reasoning. The court rejected the self-serving comments of the village that it would only use the taxes for residents of the county. While under the village's statement some taxes would be reduced, the residents of the other county would also benefit. Further, the village probably could not divide up the tax benefit under the rule of the equality and uniformity of taxation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Chapter 278 of the Laws of 1947 (as amd.) enabled certain counties, including Erie County, to enact&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a County Sales and Compensating Use Tax, and further provided that the county should pay to a village which adopted a suitable resolution, a portion of the County Sales and Compensating Use Tax which would have been applied to reduce the county tax and general town tax levied upon real property in the village. Section 4 of chapter 278 provided that any tax imposed &quot;shall have application only within the territorial limits of the county * * * imposing such tax&quot;.  Section 11 of chapter 278 provided for a distribution of the taxes raised according to relative population figures, and for educational purposes, taxes paid to school districts should be &quot;in accordance with the total average daily attendance of the pupils in such school district who reside in such county and in any such case, the amount to be raised by school taxes by the district from the portion of such district within such county shall be reduced by the amount so distributed.&quot; Erie County adopted such taxes and in the resolution of adoption provided that receipts from sales of items delivered or to be delivered outside the county should not be subject to the tax.  Petitioner village is partly in Erie County with approximately&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  one third of its population in Erie County and two thirds in Cattaraugus County.  It adopted a resolution electing to receive a portion of the county tax, the resolution not restricting the use of the funds to the benefit of the real property within the village lying in Erie County.  The enabling act, section 12 of chapter 278, provides that such taxes distributed to a village, are available for any village purpose unless restricted by the resolution to a specified purpose. There was no legislative intention that the money of the taxpayers of Erie County could be used for the extraterritorial benefit of nonresidents.  The payment of the moneys involved to petitioner village for general tax purposes was never contemplated by either the enabling act or the county resolution.  It would be violative of the general principles of equality and uniformity of taxation to permit such a distribution.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, the Mayor had no authority to depart from the specific language of the resolution itself or to impose restrictions upon the use of the money not contained in the resolution.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city proposed to issue bonds to pay for civil servants' pensions. A citizen brought an action to enjoin the bond issue and to declare New York City, N.Y., Laws ch. 440 (Law) (1965) unconstitutional. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city, and declared the Law constitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that a verified debt statement from the New York City Comptroller was prima facie evidence that the proposed bond issue would not exceed the maximum debt margin allowed by the Law, and that the citizen failed to submit any proof to counter the evidence. The court further held that the city's payment of mandatory pension and retirement liabilities was a matter of concern to the state of New York; therefore, the Law was exempt from the home rule requirements of N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2. Similarly, the city's power to issue bonds was also an area of concern to the state of New York.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- New York City bonds -- chapter 440 of Laws of 1965, which empowers Mayor of City of New York to authorize issuance of serial bonds to provide for city's payment of its pension or retirement liabilities during fiscal year 1965, is constitutional with respect to its objects and its aims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Chapter 440 of the Laws of 1965 empowers the Mayor of the City of New York to authorize the issuance of serial bonds to provide for the city's payment of its pension or retirement liabilities during the fiscal year 1965.  The statute is constitutional with respect to its object and its means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although plaintiff argues that a factual issue exists in support of his claim that the bond sale will cause the city to exceed its constitutional debt limitation (N. Y. Const., art. VIII, &sect; 4, subd.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Payment by the city of its mandatory pension or retirement liabilities is a matter of State concern exempting the statute from the home rule article of the Constitution (N. Y. Const., art. IX, &sect; 2).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The power of the city to issue evidences of indebtedness constitutes an area of State concern.  In such area, the Constitution contemplates enactment by the Legislature of special laws affecting the power of local governments to finance by issuance of evidences of indebtedness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A United States District Court found that the State's apportionment legislation was unconstitutional. The Legislature adopted interim legislation subject to the approval of the U.S. District Court. The U.S. District Court found that the legislation did not violate the United States Constitution. The action in the case at bar challenged the constitutionality of the interim legislation under the New York Constitution. The lower court found that the interim legislation was unconstitutional in that it violated N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 2 because the legislation called for 165 members in the Assembly when &sect; 2 only authorized 150 members in the Assembly. On appeal, the court found no error in the lower court's orders. The court concluded that judicial review of apportionment legislation included the power to retain jurisdiction pending corrective legislative action. The court determined that the lower court had the power to formulate an apportionment plan if the Legislature failed to formulation such a plan under decisions of the United States Supreme Court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- apportionment of Legislature -- order of State Supreme Court properly provided that if Legislature failed to enact reapportionment plan, valid under Federal and State Constitutions, by February 1, 1966, latest feasible date for such plan if election is to be held in 1966, court would take appropriate steps toward formulation of such plan -- no violation of doctrine of separation of powers -- failure of Legislature to respond to its obligation to apportion State to effectuate compliance with Federal and State Constitutions as directed by State and Federal courts will not preclude reapportionment by State courts which have constitutional obligation as to reapportionment equal and coextensive with that of Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An order of the Supreme Court of New York State properly provided that if by February 1, 1966 a reapportionment plan had not been enacted in accordance with Federal and State court directives for legislative apportionment in compliance not only with the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, but also with those&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  provisions of the State Constitution not in conflict with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, then the court itself would take appropriate steps toward the formulation of such a plan.  Although the Legislature has the primary obligation to apportion, its failure to respond to such obligation will not preclude reapportionment and the courts under such circumstances are not required to stand by helplessly when this primarily legislative function is not discharged.  The judiciary, which also has a primary obligation, to review a legislative apportionment (N. Y. Const., art. III, &sect; 5), has a constitutional obligation in respect of reapportionment equal and coextensive with that of the Legislature, and has the duty, as well as the Legislature, to preserve the State's constitutional government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Accordingly, the State courts would be derelict in performing their duties if they were not to intervene, upon request, to insure that the People of the State have the right to which they are entitled of constitutionally valid representation in a Legislature elected in accordance with both Federal and State constitutional standards, so that the present method of apportionment, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  directed by the United States courts but concededly in contravention of the State Constitution, will not continue indefinitely or until a Federal court formulates a new plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. For the legislative apportionment to be effective, it must be timely.  Although it may not be assumed that the 1966 Legislature will not discharge its obligation to reapportion in compliance with the order of the United States District Court, nevertheless, such reapportionment must be enacted by February 1, 1966 if it is to be reviewed in the light of applicable provisions of the State Constitution, inasmuch as legislative and judicial action thereafter toward a reapportionment valid under the State and Federal Constitutions is, indisputedly, not feasible for elections to be held in 1966.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The language of the order that respondents &quot;shall submit such a plan&quot; is not considered a directive to the Legislature.  The order in its entirety merely states that if such action is not taken the court will take steps to formulate such plan and thus provide for filling the vacuum which would then exist.  Thus the order does not violate the spirit of the doctrine of separation of powers.  The judiciary is not arrogating&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  political power but, on the contrary, has been and is giving the Legislature every opportunity to exercise its primary obligation of reapportionment with the caveat that if it fails to do so timely, the court will fashion reapportionment to comply with State and Federal constitutional requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The orders of the United States District Court directing an election in 1965 of a 165-member Assembly, pursuant to &quot;Plan A&quot; (the Reapportionment Compliance Act -- L. 1964, ch. 976), served only to suspend until the end of 1966 the State constitutional requirement of a 150-member Assembly (N.  Y. Const., art. III, &sect; 2).  &quot;Plan A&quot; is but a temporary measure; the Federal courts have abstained from passing on the validity of the plan under the State Constitution, and the determination of the plan's invalidity thereunder (15 N Y 2d 339, affg.  45 Misc 2d 616) fails to present any substantial Federal question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. No potential confrontation of power is discerned among co-ordinate elements of the State government.  Where the State constitutional formula and the legislative apportionment based thereon fail to comply with the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, there is concurrent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Federal and State jurisdiction under Federal aegis to effectuate compliance not only with the Fourteenth Amendment but also with those State constitutional provisions which do not impinge on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution is operating to compel conformity with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment which the State constitutional formulas for apportionment have been held to violate, and under Federal mandate the 1965 and 1966 Legislatures have been elected in contravention of the State Constitution.  However, the Federal court has afforded several opportunities for legislative reapportionment complying with Federal and State constitutional requirements; has deferred to the State courts and abstained from passing on State constitutional reapportionment questions, but has retained jurisdiction pending a permanent reapportionment satisfying both State and Federal constitutional provisions.  </SPAN></P>

Claiming that a zoning ordinance adopted by the village trustees deprived him of his property in violation of his constitutional and statutory rights, the landowner filed a cause of action for a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was illegal and void. After neighboring property owners were allowed to intervene in support of the ordinance, the landowner sought summary judgment, which was granted. The village trustees contended that: (1) the ordinance was presumptively valid; (2) there were facts in existence which sustained the adoption of the ordinance; and (3) a trial was required. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court rejected the village trustees' claim of justification, which rested on the broad objective of &quot;general welfare&quot;. They urged that the conditions of public disorder and prospective economic loss within the village were fairly within the competence of a municipal legislative body to consider in the adoption of a zoning ordinance. The court found that the village trustees had authority to address the problem, but their zoning power was not the correct method to achieve it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- after Board of Trustees of Village of Hempstead adopted amendment to village zoning ordinance placing plaintiff's property in light manufacturing district in accord with master plan which had been prepared and approved, board changed zoning to residence &quot;A&quot; district because of boycotting, picketing and threats of economic damage -- change of zoning to residence &quot;A&quot; district was illegal and void -- presumption of validity rebutted -- board did not follow its own master plan or its own conviction as to most appropriate use of land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. After plaintiff had acquired his property, the Board of Trustees of the Village of Hempstead adopted an amendment to the village zoning ordinance by which plaintiff's property, along with adjoining property, was placed in a light manufacturing district&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in accord with a master plan which had been prepared and approved.  Opposition subsequent to the adoption of the amendment took the form of threats of economic boycott against the merchants of the village, of picketing the village hall and the shopping section, and of demonstrations. At a hearing subsequently held, the Mayor stated that, while the fact that the property was in a negro neighborhood had no bearing on the decision of the board, the boycotting, picketing and threats were made by those who sought to make a race issue out of the action.  The board then adopted an amendment to the zoning ordinance placing the same area, including plaintiff's property, in a residence &quot;A&quot; district.  The amendment of the zoning ordinance was properly declared illegal and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Judicial duty requires that an ordinance be declared invalid whenever the municipal power has been exceeded, or has been exercised in an arbitrary or discriminatory fashion.  Here the board, for reasons stated in the Mayor's address as &quot;the obligation to prevent riots and injuries to residents, merchants, and shoppers&quot;, and the duty not &quot;to make the merchants suffer&quot;, passed the amendment changing the proper zoning. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Plaintiff's proof has thus rebutted the presumption of validity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. General welfare and the possibility of public disorder and prospective economic loss within the village do not justify the board's action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The board did not oppose the use of the Mayor's statement on the ground that the motives of a legislative body may not be the subject of inquiry in determining the validity of legislation.  Where the motivation is disclosed on the face of the act, that rule does not apply.  The statement was properly admissible in weighing the validity of the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Section 177 of the Village Law directs that the zoning regulations &quot;shall be made in accordance with a comprehensive plan&quot;.  The board did not follow its own master plan in passing the amendment, nor even its own conviction regarding the most appropriate use of plaintiff's land.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1(d) directed the Legislature to enact legislation for the resolution of annexation disputes between the governing bodies of municipalities. The Legislature enacted N.Y. Gen. Mun.

The common council filed a petition for a determination of whether the proposed annexation was in the over-all public interest. The town board filed a motion to dismiss the petition. Upon review, the court denied the motion. The court held that art. 17 was not unconstitutional because the State was permitted to delegate the legislative function of determining municipal boundaries to the courts. The court determined that art. 17 complied with N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1(d), and that the standard of &quot;all-over public convenience&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- annexation of territory -- article 17 of General Municipal Law implementing article IX (&sect; 1, subd. [d]) of New York State Constitution, which provided for annexation of territory of one local government by another, not in violation of Federal Constitution or of New York Constitution, and did not constitute abdication by Legislature of its power and duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Article IX (&sect; 1, subd. [d]) of the New York State Constitution provides that: &quot;No local government or any part of the territory thereof shall be annexed to another until the people, if any, of the territory proposed to be annexed shall have consented thereto by majority vote on a referendum and until the governing board of each local government, the area of which is affected, shall have consented thereto upon the basis of a determination that the annexation is in the over-all public interest. The consent of the governing board of a county shall be required only where a boundary of the county is affected. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On or before July first, nineteen hundred sixty-four, the legislature shall provide, where such consent of a governing body is not granted, for adjudication and determination, on the law and the facts, in a proceeding initiated in the supreme court, of the issue of whether the annexation is in the over-all public interest.&quot; When, pursuant to procedure provided in article 17 of the General Municipal Law, the Town Board of the Town of Bethlehem disapproved the annexation of territory in the town to the City of Albany, the Common Council of the City of Albany applied to the Appellate Division for a determination (&sect; 711) of whether the proposed annexation was in the &quot;over-all public interest&quot; and, in accord with section 712, the Appellate Division designated three Justices of the Supreme Court to hear and report. Article 17 of the General Municipal Law is not in violation of the Federal Constitution.  There is no infringement, discrimination or other violations of the Federal Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Article 17 of the General Municipal Law was not invalid as an attempt by the Legislature to amend article IX (&sect; 1, subd. [d]) of the New York State Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. While the Legislature may&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not delegate or surrender its authority to say what the law should be, by outlining the legislative policy and fixing the controlling principles it may delegate, as in this instance, to the courts the power to determine facts and conditions upon which the operation of the law depends.  There was no abdication by the Legislature of its powers and duties but rather a clear fixing of power by a constitutional amendment. The implementing legislation was in compliance with the constitutional requirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Permitting the court to base its decision upon the conception of what is the &quot;over-all public interest&quot; did not constitute the delegation of a legislative function without proper standards and was not invalid because of vagueness.  The argument that the passage of a statute by the Legislature might be unconstitutional, if not limited and defined by proper and sufficient guidelines is not applicable where, as here, the constitutional amendment delegated the authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. With all of the safeguards provided and having in mind that it was the intent of the Legislature to provide a workable form of annexation, the statute has not exceeded the bounds of the constitutional mandate and the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  procedure is proper and constitutional under the New York law.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant unsuccessfully sought the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus in the Wyoming County Court (New York). He sought appellate review and alleged that the sentencing court's failure to have had submitted to it for its consideration a psychiatric report under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 2189-a before imposing an indeterminate sentence, together with the penal institutions' failure to give him psychiatric treatment was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, prior to being tried for committing a sex offense, was reported insane, sent for psychiatric evaluation, and committed to a State hospital. After being certified as sane, defendant pled guilty to second degree assault with intent to commit the crime of sodomy. The court found that there was no proof that the sentencing court had or considered a psychiatric report submitted under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 2189-a before it sentenced defendant to an indeterminate sentence of from one year to life, nor was there any proof that he received psychiatric treatment while incarcerated at two prisons for a period of nine years. The court held that a prisoner serving an indeterminate sentence for a sex offense should be required to receive a thorough psychiatric examination not less than once every two years, as well as consideration by the Parole Board. In light of the failure to comply with &sect; 2189-a and the court's mandates, the court ordered that defendant be remanded to the sentencing court for a full and complete hearing as to the extent of the psychological and psychiatric treatment afforded him and to assess his capability for release on parole.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the dismissal of defendant's petition for habeas corpus and remanded the case to the sentencing court for a full hearing.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator, who pleaded guilty to a charge of assault in the second degree with intent to commit the crime of sodomy, alleges that the sentencing court failed to have submitted to it for consideration a psychiatric report in compliance with section 2189-a of the Penal Law, and that the penal institutions in which he has been incarcerated failed to give him any psychiatric&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  treatment, as mandated by the statute under which he received a one day to life sentence. His contention that he was not given a psychiatric examination pursuant to the Penal Law ( &sect; 2189-a) was not explored at the hearing in this habeas corpus proceeding.  Even if the psychiatric report was before the sentencing court the Attorney-General fails to refute, or in any manner deny, the statement made by relator that during his nine years' imprisonment at no time did he receive any kind of psychiatric treatment or any modern rehabilitation or any rehabilitation except imprisonment at hard labor. Relator alleges that he appeared before the Parole Board on four occasions and the board did not consider him for parole despite the report of the supervising psychiatrist that relator was not dangerous and a good risk, and should be released on parole. If, as claimed, relator has been in custody approximately 12 years under the circumstances set forth in his petition, this is a direct violation of the recommendations of the committee whose report was the basis for the statutory enactment. The matter is remanded to the Wyoming County Court for a full and complete hearing dealing specifically&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with the questions of compliance with section 2189-a of the Penal Law and the extent of the psychological and psychiatric treatment given relator during his many years of imprisonment. Relator should further be given a complete psychiatric examination by a duly qualified psychiatrist to determine whether it would be dangerous to release him and whether he is now capable of rejoining society on the outside.  At the hearing the statement made by the supervising psychiatrist of Attica Prison should be investigated and there should also be secured such reports concerning relator as Attica Prison has and, if possible, there should be an examination, as a witness, of the supervising psychiatrist. </SPAN></P>

It provided further that &quot;Such local laws may change or supersede any provision of an act of the legislature theretofore enacted which provision does not in terms and in effect apply alike to all cities.&quot; The 1864 statute to be superseded &quot;does not in terms and in effect apply alike to all cities.&quot; These local laws do relate to the property, affairs or government of the city.  The election of the city to have the fund administered by its own officers, as mandated by these local laws, was properly and constitutionally within its home-rule powers.  </SPAN></P>
