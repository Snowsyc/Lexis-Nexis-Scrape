Const. art. X, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state recognized the need to link the state to international markets. The state legislator authorized a bond issue to construct docking facilities and provide facilities to export grain. The grain elevator was constructed pursuant to several bonds issues. The association and the Authority entered into an agreement whereby the association would spend money to improve and maintain the elevator. The association was granted complete custody of the elevator. The only expenditure by the state was its capital investment to build and expand the elevator. The state attorney general claimed that the agreement was not valid because it provided a private corporation with a profit while it caused a net loss to the state. The association initiated an action. In entering judgment in favor of the association, the court found that the agreement was a legal, valid, and binding contract that did not violate the state constitution. The operation of the elevator was primarily for the benefit of the state and the farmers, so that its operation was for a public purpose. The fact that the association was making a profit from the elevator did not change the public purpose into a private one.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 12-47-440 for refunds of soft drink taxes paid under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-21-1710.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the bottlers argued that S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 12-21-2120 and 12-21-2050 discriminated against out-of-state bottlers and unconstitutionally burdened interstate commerce. In reversing, the court ruled that, although the Soft Drink Tax statute did not impose liability on nonresident bottlers, the manner in which the tax was administered effectively required them to pay the tax through the purchase of tax crowns or lids because their resident distributors were not permitted to buy and affix the crowns. The court found that substantial advantages were afforded resident bottlers because &sect; 12-21-2050 effectively excluded nonresident bottlers from receiving discounts under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-21-2030 and from using the alternative tax system without crowns, lids, and stamps available to domestic bottlers under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-21-2120. The court held that the allegations of the complaint raised justiciable issues concerning the illegal effect of the statutes on interstate commerce and that the trial judge was in error in sustaining the demurrer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The General Assembly created a five-member Williamsburg County Recreation Commission in 1971 as a special purpose district. The Commission hired the director in 1974. The Commission's membership was increased to seven by 1975 S.C. Acts. 246. The seven-member Commission renewed the director's contract in March, 1977. The Commission's membership was increased to nine by 1977 S.C. Acts 381. The nine-member Commission discharged the director in August, 1977. The director argued that the acts that increased the Commission's membership were special legislation that violated S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 7 and 10, which prohibited the General Assembly from enacting laws for a specific county or municipality. The court held that: (1) the trial court erred when it found that the two acts that increased the Commission's membership were permissible transitional legislation because they did not relate to the operative machinery necessary to implement the home-rule provisions of art. VIII; and (2) 1975 S.C. Acts 246 and 1977 S.C. Acts 381 were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed a judgment of the Richland County Circuit Court (South Carolina) that convicted them of an obscenity charge in violation of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-15-260 (1976), arguing that the statute was unconstitutionally objectionable because it violated the Miller standards for defining obscenity as set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of violating S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-15-260 (1976) based upon their possession and sale of obscene materials. Defendants appealed their convictions, challenging the constitutionality of the statute under which they were prosecuted. In affirming, the court rejected defendants' argument that the statute was constitutionally objectionable because it violated the standards set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S. Ct. 2607, 37 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1973), in defining &quot;prurient interest&quot; as reflective of an arousal of lewd and lascivious desires and thoughts. The court held that the Miller guidelines to regulate obscenity had not been infringed by the statute and its application. The definition actually increased the prosecution's burden before a conviction would be proper, and it was not improper to permit obscenity to be determined by contemporary community standards. No particular verbiage was required to define obscenity; while obscenity might be difficult to define, it was not difficult to detect, and it was difficult for the court to conceive of any definition that would not cover the material at issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The director asserted that the trial court's award to defendant to compensate for his attorneys' fees and costs was in excess of the maximum allowable under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-3-26(B) (Cum. Supp. 1981) and that the award of expert fees was in excess of the maximum established by &sect; 16-3-26(C) (Cum. Supp. 1981). The court reversed in part and modified the awards of fees and costs. Defendant, who was indigent, was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, defendant's sentence was reversed and remanded for a new sentencing proceeding. Prior to the new proceeding, defendant's attorneys moved for approval of estimated costs for psychiatric and psychological experts, which exceeded the statutory maximums provided therefor. The trial judge indicated that he would consider the bills after trial, and after trial awarded fees and costs in excess of the maximum allowed under &sect; 16-3-26(B). The court held that the language of &sect; 16-3-26(B) was clear and unambiguous and the trial court erred when it made its award. The court held that limitation of expert fees in 16-3-26(C) was constitutional because the spending cap for expert fees applied to capital as well as non-capital offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The enactment of the Joint Municipal Electric Power and Energy Act of 1978, S.C. Code, tit. 6, ch. 23 (1976), enabled South Carolina municipalities to form a joint power agency for the purpose of purchasing a part interest in a nuclear power plant. The power agency then offered bulk power for sale to each of its member municipalities. To finance the acquisition, the power agency issued revenue bonds. The ratepayers brought a declaratory judgment action to prevent the issuance of the bonds claiming that the Act was unconstitutional. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the Act. On appeal, the court held that: (1) S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect;16, authorized municipalities, upon approval of their electors, to join together to provide power and the Act simply provided an alternative method for them to do so through a joint power agency; (2) the power agency was a separate political subdivision and was not subject to the election requirements of S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 16; and (3) the taxing power of the member municipalities was not pledged to secure the obligations of the agency where its bonds were paid from revenue collected from power sales.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the inmate argued that the rape statute, former S.C.

In affirming, the court ruled that &sect; 16-3-630 was not violative of the equal protection clause because the differentiation on the basis of gender was closely related to the State interest in protecting teenaged females from the consequences of pregnancy, which fell more significantly on females than males. The court rejected the averment of ineffectiveness of counsel and found that the record showed that he received vigorous professional representation at both trial and on direct appeal and that he interfered with his counsel's actions by dismissing him. Although the inmate raised several additional issues, the court found that they had not been raised at trial or on direct appeal and were not subject to review in the post-conviction action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that he had an enforceable agreement wit the State for a sentence of life imprisonment. The State claimed that no agreement was ever reached, and that in response to defendant's proposal to plead guilty, the solicitor advised defendant that he would consider the guilty plea only upon a firm commitment from defendant and that he would discuss the matter with the victim's family before reaching a final decision. Because the solicitor made no promise to refrain from seeking the death penalty, and the parties had engaged only in negotiations, the State was not required to refrain from seeking the death penalty. Further, the South Carolina Death Penalty Statute,&nbsp;S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-3-20(C) was not inappropriate applied to defendant's case because the testimony showed that upon entering the store where the robbery was committed, defendant immediately shot the victim. Before leaving the store, defendant shot the victim again. The trial court did not err in not charging the jury on involuntary manslaughter and felony murder because there was no evidence to support those charges and they would have been improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for murder in the commission of an armed robbery. The State sought the death penalty pursuant to S.C. Code &sect; 16-3-20 (1976) (Supp.), enacted after the commission of the alleged murder. Defendant moved for an order prohibiting the State from seeking the death penalty as South Carolina then had no operative death penalty. A trial court of Georgetown County (South Carolina) granted defendant's motion. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole question on appeal involved the applicability of the death penalty statute to a crime committed prior to its effective date. When defendant allegedly committed the crime, there was no South Carolina statute, which permitted the death penalty for murder. An effective procedure for the enforcement of the death penalty was finally enacted some nine months after defendant allegedly committed the murder of which he was charged. There was, therefore, no &quot;operative fact,&quot; to warn defendant that the State would seek to impose the death penalty if he were convicted. The court did not think the mere declaration that the punishment for murder shall be death, with no means or authority to enforce it, could serve to warn a defendant that the State might seek the death penalty if he committed murder. Thus, the court held that because there was no operative death penalty statute in South Carolina when defendant allegedly committed the crime charged, the act of defendant could not trigger the death penalty without violating the ex post facto prohibition against retroactive laws creating a greater punishment than would have attached under the law at the time of the offense.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 21-3503 (1962) and S.C. Code &sect;&sect; 21-3515 to 21-3517 (1962) and dealing with the Marlboro County Board of Education, were constitutional. One appellant also sought a refund of property taxes levied for use by the Board and paid under protest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to S.C. Code &sect; 21-3503 (1962), as amended, the Board was composed of persons appointed by the Governor for five-year terms upon the recommendation of the Marlboro County Legislative Delegation. Appellants argued that S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, which required a separation of powers of government, was violated by the conferral of the power to recommend appointments. Appellants also argued that S.C. Code &sect;&sect; 21-3515 to 21-3517, which authorized the Board to direct the levy and collection of all tax millage necessary to meet the school district operating budget, violated S.C. Const. art. X, &sect; 5. The court held that the function of making or recommending appointments to public office did not necessarily or ordinarily belong to either of the branches of state government and could properly have been conferred upon and performed by the Delegation. However, the court held that the General Assembly could not, consistent with art. X, &sect; 5, delegate the unrestricted power of taxation to an appointive body. Thus, the Act was unconstitutional insofar as it undertook to confer the arbitrary power upon the Board to fix and determine the amount of tax to be levied for school operations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district brought a declaratory action against the county treasurer, seeking to have the interest from the investment of school district funds credited to the school district account instead of the sinking fund of the county. Upon considering reciprocal summary judgment motions, the trial court dismissed the school district's action, holding that there was no justiciable controversy because the school district had suffered no injury and, therefore, lacked standing. On appeal, the court ruled the school district's complaint raised a justiciable issue. The court held that that the deprivation of interest from the investment of school funds injured the school district and accordingly, the school district had standing to raise the issue. The court held that 1958 S.C. Acts 853, which authorized the county treasurer to invest funds not necessary for current expenses and to credit the interest earned on that money to the sinking fund of the county's bond account, violated S.C. Const. art. 3, &sect; 34, because, a general law, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-45-220 was applicable, and permitted the investment of funds to specified securities and investments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were with their girlfriends (one of whom was a juvenile) when they kidnapped, sexually assaulted, and killed a woman; one defendant sought to minimize his role in the crime, and the other did not testify. On review, the court held that the death penalty was not unconstitutional, that S.C. Code &sect; 16-3-910 (Supp. 1980) was not overbroad, and that it was not error to refuse to quash one defendant's indictment. That defendant's grant of immunity was properly withdrawn when he was shown to be a principal by his own written confession. The court found no error in failing to change venue because of publicity, in not severing the trial, and in permitting voir dire by the State, and in denying a belated peremptory challenge to one juror. The court found that the trial court was without power to release the juvenile's records and that the solicitor was not obligated to release them. The court reversed the death sentence. The trial court committed error in allowing the solicitor's closing comments that he would never again ask for the death penalty if the jury did not recommend it and that the trial judge could ignore their recommendation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to allow his counsel to inspect notes used to refresh the recollection of a witness, that his cross-examination was highly improper, and that a jury instruction regarding the death penalty was improper. The court reversed defendant's convictions. The refusal to permit defendant's trial counsel the opportunity to examine a witness's notes for purposes of cross-examination constituted reversible error because opposing counsel was required to have the opportunity to examine notes a witness used to refresh his memory prior to trial. The solicitor's cross-examination of defendant, which raised the issue of the death penalty, was prejudicial error. When defendant waived his privilege against self-incrimination by electing to take the witness stand in the first phase of the trial, he opened himself to impeachment only as to issues related to his innocence or guilt, not as to punishment. The jury instruction on the death penalty was reversible error given that it charged a death penalty act that had been declared unconstitutional, rather than the current act.</SPAN></P>

The magistrates claimed that they were entitled to salaries based upon the uniform pay scale established by the constitution, and that the statute permitting counties to establish their pay was unconstitutional.

The establishment of the uniform judiciary was mandatory. Statutes that extended a nonunified system or that operated so as to postpone or defeat the purpose of Article V were unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its answer, the county sought a declaratory judgment that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 14-11-30 violated S.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 1, in that it unconstitutionally delegated to the counties the power to fix the compensation of masters-in-equity and required the counties to pay such compensation. The court held that the General Assembly could not delegate to the counties the power to fix the compensation of those holding judicial &quot;office&quot; within the State judicial system. Such delegation clearly exceeded the scope of &quot;local concerns,&quot; and contravened the spirit of S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 14(4 &amp; 6), which withdrew the administration of the statewide judicial system from the field of local matters. S.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 22, granted to the General Assembly a reasonable time to repeal the unconstitutional statutory scheme and establish one in accord with S.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 1. The court held that the county was required to determine and pay reasonable compensation to the master-in-equity from the general funds of the county until the General Assembly enacted a uniform pay scale for masters-in-equity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife's complaint, in which she sought one-half of the net proceeds from the sale of the marital home, a home titled in the husband's name but sold during the course of the marriage, alleged that the husband breached a contract in which she renounced her dower rights in return for one-half of the sale proceeds. The complaint further sought an equitable distribution based on the material contributions of the wife to the marriage. Although the husband raised the Statute of Frauds as an affirmative defense, he sought dismissal solely on the ground that equitable distribution was unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the complaint, holding both equitable distribution and dower were unconstitutional and that the Statute of Frauds barred the claim. On appeal, the court ruled that dismissal on equitable distribution grounds was error, as the doctrine was not gender-based. Further, because the constitutionality of dower was not before the trial court, it erred in determining this issue. Finally, because the issue of the applicability of the Statute of Frauds was not before the trial court on the motion to dismiss, it also erred in considering this issue.</SPAN></P>

Defendant raised numerous errors relating to the performance of defense counsel and the solicitor, jury selection, jury instructions, and various evidentiary issues. Defendant also contended that the South Carolina Death Penalty Statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected defendant's contention that defense counsel was ineffective because defendant failed to show how defense counsel's alleged deficiencies affected the outcome of the trial. The court found that the trial court did not err in excluding prospective jurors that were unalterably opposed to capital punishment because they could not carry out their duty to render an impartial decision. The use of voter registration rolls to select the jury pool did not violate defendant's Sixth Amendment rights to have a jury representative of the community because the rolls were the most representative source of a community. The charge of armed robbery was properly submitted to the jury because the evidence showed that defendant took a shotgun into the victim's residence. The fact that the shotgun's stock was broken during his beating of the victim did not change its character as a deadly weapon even if it was rendered inoperable. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and death sentence, finding that defendant failed to show that the South Carolina Death Penalty Statute,&nbsp;S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-3-20, was unconstitutional because he made no showing of disproportionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment upon a conviction for armed robbery. He contended on appeal that the sentencing statute,&nbsp;S.C. Code &sect; 16-11-330 (1976), which prescribed a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years, without eligibility for parole for seven years, was unconstitutional. The court disagreed, ruling first that the statutory provisions were not an unwarranted legislative intrusion in violation of the separation of powers doctrine in S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, and the federal constitution. Furthermore, the imposition of a minimum mandatory sentence without opportunity for parole did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, nor was it disproportionate to the crime. Moreover, the punishment prescribed compared favorably with punishments in other jurisdictions for the same offense. Finally, the court rejected the statute's challenge on equal protection grounds. Treating adult offenders under the age of 21 differently than adult offenders aged 21 to 25, by setting a lower minimum sentence for the former, was rationally related to the legitimate state interest of extending leniency to offenders who were more likely to profit from rehabilitative efforts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The testator designated defendant North Carolina bank as trustee of a pour-over trust. She and plaintiff husband, her executor, moved to South Carolina, where she died. During administration of the estate, the husband discovered that South Carolina's lock-out law, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 21-29-40 (1976), prohibited the bank from acting as trustee. The husband challenged the law, but the Horry County Circuit Court (South Carolina) dismissed the suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the husband had no standing to challenge the legislation. The court disagreed. The challenge of the estate was not an attempt to assert the rights of others but involved the testator's own interests in designating a trustee. That being said, the court held that South Carolina's lock-out law, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 21-29-40 (1976), was violative of the equal protection provisions of S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. Under the law, the bank did not qualify as a testamentary trustee for the sole reason that it was contiguous to South Carolina. The testator was a member of an identifiable group of testators wishing to choose a foreign corporation as a testamentary trustee and was treated differently from other members because she was not permitted to select the bank due to its contiguous relationship to South Carolina. Since testators wishing to use a foreign corporation as a testamentary trustee were treated differently, the State had to demonstrate a legitimate interest which was advanced by preventing a testator from choosing a corporation trustee as nearby as a neighboring state and the court failed to see any justification.</SPAN></P>

Defendants argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in refusing to permit defendants' counsel to examine the notes that a state witness had available to him for cross-examination and that &sect; 16-3-654 was so vague and ambiguous as to deprive them of due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The three defendants were convicted of criminal sexual conduct in the third degree involving the gang rape of the victim. The state called an officer to testify to statements allegedly made to him freely and voluntarily by the first defendant. On cross-examination, the officer testified that he made notes during his interview, which he reviewed in preparation for his trial testimony. The trial court found a portion of the notes to be relevant, but upon the state's objection, denied defense counsel's request to review the notes. Defendants were convicted; and on appeal, the court reversed, holding that because the notes were used to refresh the officer's recollection, defendants were entitled to inspect the notes. The court held that particularly because the notes were available, found to be relevant and not privileged, the trial court erred in refusing defense counsels' request for inspection of the notes. For purposes of remand, the court further held that the statute was not impermissibly vague or ambiguous, and that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury's finding that defendants were guilty of criminal sexual conduct beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 14-21-30 (1976).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A newspaper reporter went to a crime scene where two youths had been slain. Based on her investigation, the newspaper published her story and a picture of a youth who was in the custody of the police. Other media picked up the story or picture from a wire service and published it. Appellants were found in contempt for having published the name of the juvenile, who was the subject of a family court action, in violation of S.C. Code &sect; 14-21-30 (1976), which prohibited such disclosure without court authorization. On appeal, the court reversed, ruling that the provision violated appellants' rights under U.S. Const. amend. I. Explaining, the court said that the State could not punish a newspaper for the publication of truthful information, lawfully obtained, about a matter of public significance, except when necessary to further a State interest of the highest order. Despite the State's contention that such interests were at stake, the court found no interest of the State or the juvenile that was sufficient to withstand the constitutional mandate when there was an attempt to prevent a truthful publication of lawfully obtained information. Thus, the provision was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

On appeal defendant argued, among other things, that &sect; 56-5-2910 should be declared unconstitutional because &sect; 16-3-60, concerning involuntary manslaughter, provided different penalties for identical conduct. Specifically, he contended that the statutory scheme was constitutionally defective because it allowed the solicitor to arbitrarily choose the section upon which to prosecute. The state supreme court affirmed defendant's conviction. The fact that a prosecuting attorney may select which of several offenses with which an accused may be charged was not constitutionally obnoxious. A solicitor was routinely called upon to decide to prosecute under one of two statutes with varying elements. Once it was determined that conviction was possible under either statute, the context of the decision became indistinguishable from the situation of two statutes punishing exactly the same conduct. The prosecutor may have been influenced by the penalties available upon conviction but that fact alone did not give rise to a violation of the Equal Protection or Due Process Clauses.</SPAN></P>

The trial court (South Carolina) entered a judgment for the company on the ground that the Act did not apply to the accounts under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 27-17-340. The Commission appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company held separate accounts of unclaimed cash credits for former customers. Each account totalled less than $ 25. The company claimed that the accounts were exempt from the Act because &sect; 27-17-340 exempted property totaling less than $ 25. The Commission claimed that the accounts had to be added together and the aggregate figure used to determine the application of &sect; 27-17-340. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's construction of the Act. The court held that the $ 25 limitation of &sect; 27-17-340 applied to the aggregate amount of abandoned funds held, not to individual items or accounts. The Act was initially unconstitutional because it violated S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 17; the Act was originally enacted as part of an appropriations act and did not relate to the subject of the appropriations act. However, the Act's constitutional defect was cured when it was reenacted; the Act was declared to be part of the general statutory law of the state and separated from the appropriations act.</SPAN></P>

The contractor challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain liability, the exclusion of certain testimony, and the applicability of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-300 (1976), referred to as the comparative negligence statute. First, the court determined that the issue of the constitutionality of &sect; 15-1-300 was not preserved for review and therefore, the statute controlled the analysis of the sufficiency of the evidence. In affirming the decision, the court held that the fault of the passenger and the driver was not greater than that of the contractor and thus, under &sect; 15-1-300, the estates were not barred from recovery. The contractor failed meet the standards for warning devices in its contract. In addition, the inadequacy of the warning devices was compounded by the fact that the approach to the bridge was complete, there was not proper inspection and maintenance of the devices employed, and the contractors should have know from the presence of litter that the highway was being used by the public.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1875 in response to the state home rule enabling legislation, the voters in the county selected the council-administrator form of government. Following the county referendum vote and according to state law, the legislature passed 1976 S.C. Acts 845 providing for the election of eight county council members. Even though the council members were elected, the law was required to get preclearance approval by the U.S. Attorney General under the Voting Rights of 1965. A federal action was filed to resolve the law's effect. The legislature then repealed the law and passed 1980 S.C. Acts R308, &sect;&sect; 2, 4 and R320.

The court had previously ruled that the legislature had limited authority to enact special legislation to create a county government. The court held that the legislation did not violate S.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to an authorized resolution passed by the city council, the city converted a portion of a city street into a public mall. When the project was completed, a landowner refused to pay related assessments. The city initiated an action to auction the landowner's property in order to collect the overdue assessments. The landowner sought a restraining order against the city, arguing that the assessments were void and unconstitutional because the mall project constituted improvements on streets and sidewalks within the meaning of S.C. Const. art. X, &sect; 17. The landowner argued that the city's efforts were unconstitutional because the requisite two thirds of the abutting landowners had not consented in writing, nor had the city paid at least 50 percent of the cost of such improvements. The court found that the provisions of art. X, &sect; 17 did not apply because the portion of the street developed by the city was closed as a street and was no longer within the state highway system. The court emphasized that the fact that the mall allowed pedestrians did not make for a street in the constitutional sense, anymore than construction of a park limited to pedestrians would be a street.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The class representative was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment while there was no operative death penalty statute in the State. The representative brought a class action before filing a petition for federal habeas corpus relief, in which he sought a determination of whether the 1977 Death Penalty Act, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-3-20 (Cum. Supp. 1979), could be applied to the new trial he would receive if he was successful in federal court. The Attorney General demurred, which was overruled. Appeal was taken. The court held that: (1) the allegations of the complaint failed to show the existence of a justiciable controversy; (2) the representative was requesting the court to render an impermissible advisory opinion; (3) the complaint did not allege the representative was facing trial or that an action for collateral relief from his conviction was pending in any forum; and (4) what the representative sought was a premature resolution of a contingency rather than a judicial determination of a real and substantial controversy, which was required for declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that his indictment should have been quashed because the criminal sexual conduct statute was unconstitutionally vague, that the trial court erred by admitting the victim's identification, and that the photographic and physical lineups were unduly suggestive. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that because defendant's conduct fell squarely within the terms of S.C. Code &sect; 16-3-652 (1979) as defined in S.C. Code &sect; 16-3-651 (1979) the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to quash his indictment. The fact that the photographic and physical lineups were within a day of each other did not render them unduly suggestive and did not taint both the victim's out of court and in court identifications. Defendant's motion for a mistrial was properly denied. The failure to disclose the fact the victim did not make a positive identification at the photographic lineup did not deprive defendant of a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 16-year-old minor was charged in the family court with assault and battery with intent to kill, armed robbery, and attempted armed robbery. A hearing was conducted in the family court pursuant to &sect; 14-21-540 to determine whether it would be contrary to the best interest of the minor or of the public to retain jurisdiction of the offenses in the family court. The family court transferred trial jurisdiction to the court of general sessions. On review, the minor's major assertion was that the investigation requirements of S.C. Code &sect; 14-21-560 (1976) were applicable to a transfer proceeding under S.C. Code &sect; 14-21-540 (1976). The court agreed, but rejected the minor's contended that the family court did not comply with S.C. Code &sect; 14-21-560 (1976). The information received by the family court regarding the minor's background was sufficient to comply with &sect; 14-21-560. The court also concluded that the &quot;best interests&quot; standard was sufficient, especially when coupled with the right of appellate review, to satisfy the requirements of due process and equal protection.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaining witness received an obscene telephone call from an anonymous male caller, who was subsequently identified as defendant.

While the language of the statute was broad, the court did not find that it was so vague as to be easily misunderstood nor so broad as to extend beyond the State's power to enact. The court held that the State had a legitimate interest in prohibiting obscene, threatening or harassing telephone calls. The court construed &sect; 16-17-430 as proscribing only calls initiated by one with the intent and sole purpose of conveying an unsolicited obscene, imminently threatening and/or harassing message to an unwilling recipient.

The court noted that these findings showed that the applicant's doctoral program was not accredited and recognized by a national accrediting agency, nor were his credits accepted by the University of South Carolina. The court held that to decide otherwise would be to require licensure in the face of obvious statutory noncompliance. The court disagreed that S.C.

The trial court denied the motion and the trial proceeded in the counsel's and the corporation's absence. A jury returned a verdict in favor of the claimants. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial. The court held that the power of the court to grant or deny legislative continuance was not unlimited but had to be exercised in recognition of the right of members of the general assembly to perform their legislative duties. There was no request for emergency relief and no showing that any right of the litigants would be adversely affected by a grant of a continuance, thus the trial court abused its discretion in denying the requested continuance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation brought an action against respondents, the South Carolina Tax Commission and its members, to recover income taxes paid under protest. A Spartanburg County (South Carolina) trial court denied the corporation's motion for judgment on the pleadings on its second and third causes of action. The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission made a final assessment of the corporation's 1970 income tax return in 1976. Under S.C. Code &sect; 12-7-2230 (1976), the corporation's failure to notify the Commission that the Internal Revenue Service had previously begun examining the corporation's 1970 return suspended the statute of limitations for assessments under S.C. Code &sect; 12-7-2220. The court rejected the corporation's argument that S.C. Code &sect; 12-7-2230 was unconstitutional under S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 17. The court found that the statute was reasonably and inherently related to the collection of tax revenues and was germane to the General Appropriations Act, thereby meeting the requirement of S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 17 that an act relate to but one subject, with the topics in the body of the act being kindred in nature and having a legitimate and natural association with the subject of the title. Furthermore, the court stated, the statute met the second requirement of S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 17 in that its title conveyed reasonable notice of its subject matter to the legislature and the public. The court also held that because the statute was remedial in nature, it could be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 21-1038.6 (1962).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board brought an action against the Delegation for declaratory relief from what the Board claimed were unconstitutional portions of S.C. Code &sect; 21-1038.6 (1962). The declaratory judgment action questioned the constitutionality under the separation of powers doctrine of the provisions of the statute that gave approval authority of millage increases to the Delegation. The trial court denied relief to the Board. The Board contended that by vesting the Delegation with approval power over any proposed increase in tax levies for school purposes, the legislature attempted to cloak the Delegation with executive functions, which violated the separation of powers doctrine in the state constitution. The court held that: (1) because the functions of the Delegation in the instant case were not incidental to or comprehended within the scope of legislative duties, the separation of powers doctrine, as provided by S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, had clearly been violated; (2) the court's action in striking down participation of the Delegation in setting a millage increase rendered a referendum portion of the statute meaningless; and (3) the remainder of the statute was valid and stayed in effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State Legislature, the General Assembly, passed 1979 S.C.

The General Assembly elected five new members for the Court of Appeals, four of whom were members of the General Assembly at the time of their election to their respective offices. The legislation and the creation of the Court of Appeals was challenged by the Governor and the State Attorney General. The court ruled that the General Assembly had the authority to create the Court of Appeals; and that portions of 1979 S.C. Laws No. 164, Part IV-A, were unconstitutional, specifically S.C. Code &sect;&sect; 14-8-30, 14-8-80, 14-8-240, and 14-8-400. The court held that S.C. Const. art. 5, &sect; 1, did not deprive the General Assembly of the power to create the Court of Appeals by legislation. However, S.C. Code &sect; 2-1-100 (1937), which forbade senators or representatives from being elected by the General Assembly or appointed by any executive authority to any civil office, was a general law that applied to court positions, as well.

Defendant claimed that the statute limited the right to confront witnesses and deprived defendant of a fair trial in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States and their South Carolina counterparts. The court ruled that defendant had no fundamental right to ask a witness questions that were irrelevant. Inquiry on cross-examination into the victim's sexual behavior with third persons was not relevant. Moreover, the victim's sexual activity with third persons was not in any way probative of the victim's credibility or veracity. Even if it were, the relevancy would be so minimal it would not meet the test of prejudice.

Within three hours police spotted a car matching this description. In it were two black males. Police stopped the vehicle and arrested the men when they started shouting obscenities. A search of the vehicle yielded evidence of the crime. In affirming the convictions the court held that the evidence seized from the car was properly admitted. Police had probable cause to stop the car based on the pawn broker's descriptions. They had probable cause to arrest defendants for disorderly conduct, a violation of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-17-530(b). The initial and follow-on searches of the vehicle were proper. Even if &sect; 16-17-530(b) were overbroad, the officers acted in good faith and with probable cause, so the constitutionality of the statute was irrelevant.

The driver alleged that the accident was not intentional on his part and denied that he was guilty of any reckless, wilful, or wanton misconduct in the operation of his vehicle within the meaning of the South Carolina Guest Statute,&nbsp;S.C. Code Ann. 15-1-290. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment for the driver and concluded that the guest statute violated the equal protection guarantees of S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV since there was no rational justification for singling out passengers injured in automobile accidents as different from all others injured in negligent torts. The court ruled that the &quot;protection of hospitality&quot; rationale did not justify the statute's differential treatment of automobile guests as distinguished from all other recipients of a host's generosity. Also, the court found that although the statute prevented some collusive suits between hosts and passengers, the statute's over-inclusiveness was devastating as it operated to bar the majority of valid claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The method by which candidates for magistrate were supplied to the Governor for appointment was by holding advisory primary elections. The court held that this process and 57 S.C. Stat. 3044 were plainly violative of S.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 23. The court noted that S.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 23, provided that magistrates were to be appointed by the Governor. Accordingly, every other method of selection, including by popular election, was excluded. This was also consistent with S.C. Const. art. V, &sect;&sect; 3 and 9, specifying the manner of selection of circuit court judges and supreme court justices. The court also noted that where magistrates once were elected, the 1895 revision to the constitution provided for their appointment. The court held that although the advisory elections were well-intentioned and non-binding, they infringed the gubernatorial prerogative and were unconstitutional. The court noted that with extremely rare exception the appointee was a winner of these contests.

The court also stated that defendant's motion to sequester the State witnesses was correctly denied since he was unable to explain how the failure to sequester would prejudice him. Further, the court ruled that voir dire was correctly done and that the trial court did not commit error in permitting a forensic pathologist to give his opinion concerning the distance of the shotgun blast and the absence of powder burns. In addition, the court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in the admissible of evidence because it was properly identified and relevant. Finally, the court observed that the jury instructions correctly stated the law and his confession was voluntarily given.

The circuit court found that the act was constitutional. The park commission appealed. In reversing, the court concluded that the act was unconstitutional because it violated S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 7 and 10. Under S.C. Const. art. VIII, the South Carolina General Assembly was prohibited from enacting laws for a specific county or municipality, and the power to regulate recreational districts within a county was a proper function of local government. In the act under consideration, the general assembly endeavored to alter the jurisdiction and transfer the assets of a recreational district within one county; this constituted the type of special legislation that was proscribed by S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 7and 10.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged the statutory scheme under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 14-7-1110 (1976) for allocating peremptory strikes to prospective jurors in a criminal case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from his conviction for armed robbery, defendant contended that the statutory scheme under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 14-7-1110 for allocating peremptory strikes in a criminal case violated equal protection and due process. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. Specifically, the court held that there was no constitutional right, state or federal, to any peremptory challenges. The determination rested entirely within the province of the legislature. As such, the court concluded that it could not find that the state legislature had deprived persons charged with armed robbery of their constitutional rights simply because it chose to limit their peremptory challenges to five. Defendant's contention that the number of peremptories allotted to armed robbery was out of proportion to those allotted to less severely punished crimes was essentially an attack on the wisdom of the statute and not the constitutionality of the statute. Finally, the court held that a gun used in a robbery was a deadly weapon regardless of its alleged inoperability.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, arguing that the method used to select the jury violated his rights under U.S. Const. amend. VI and XIV. The court held that the statutes used by the magistrate's court to select the jury, S.C. Code Ann. 22-3-770 and 22-3-780, failed to meet constitutional muster in two regards. The magistrate was given the authority to look about him and to select a person to choose a jury panel, and the person selected had an almost unbridled authority to find 18 &quot;respectable voters&quot; from whom a jury of six would be selected to try a particular criminal case. If the sheriff or a constable was chosen to make the selection, it was apparent that the potential for abuse was abundant. The method of drawing a magistrate's jury in a criminal case did not tend to assure a cross-section of citizens fairly representative of the community. While it is entirely likely that jurors drawn under &sect;&sect; 22-3-770 and 22-3-780 would render a fair trial, such was not assured, and the possibility of prejudice was always present.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1975, the voters of Horry County selected a council-administrator form of government and expressed a preference for the election of at-large council members. In 1976, the General Assembly provided for the election of eight council members and a chairman. Candidates were elected and served until March, 1979. A federal action to determine if the act creating the council was valid under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1973c, was dismissed prior to a determination. The General Assembly then passed 1978 S.C. Acts. R760 and 1978 S.C. Acts R834, which increased the membership of the council to 11 and provided for the election of council members from single-member districts. The Justice Department did not object to the changes, and a new council was elected. The court held that under S. C. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 7, the acts that increased the council's membership were unconstitutional special legislation. The court held that although it was necessary to comply with the Voting Rights Act, the General Assembly could not enact successive legislation to secure Justice Department sanction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged the constitutionality of the various statutes relating to magistrates on several grounds. It asserted that some of the enactments violated S.C. Const. art. V, &sect;&sect; 1 and 23, which required that all judicial power be vested in a unified judicial system. It also contended that several of the statutes conflicted with S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 34(IX), which proscribed local or special legislation in situations where general law could be made applicable. Finally, it alleged that the regulations that allowed magistrates to collect fees in certain cases violated the Due Process Clause of the state and federal constitutions. The court agreed that the six of the challenged enactments violated S.C. Const. art. V, &sect;&sect; 1 and 23 and therefore, did not reach the question of whether those provisions violated S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 34 (IX). It held that the enactment that permitted magistrates in certain counties to collect fees in civil or criminal proceedings violated the Due Process Clauses of the state and federal constitutions.

The court ruled that although the trial judge did not specifically define contributory recklessness, willfulness, and wantonness, this omission was not prejudicial since it was clear that the jury was adequately informed of the elements of this defense. The court also ruled that driver #2 was not entitled to an unconditional charge that contributory recklessness, willfulness, and wantonness would be a complete bar to recovery because the contributory negligence was not a bar to driver #1's recovery, and &quot;negligence&quot; as used in S.C.

XIV in that grocery stores which could have been operated with three or fewer employees were permitted to operate on Sunday, whereas larger grocery stores which could not be operated by three or fewer employees were prohibited. The court held that the legislature could have reasonably found that the health and welfare of the populace required that items normally sold by small grocery stores was available. By limiting the workers to three, the statute insured that the day of rest was extended to the maximum number of citizens, while at the same time making necessary food items available. By limiting the workers to three, the statute insured that the grocery business would not take in a regular weekday full-scale volume, with concomitant traffic, noise and activity.

Appellant's attorney had stated to the trial court that he had been &quot;unable to locate&quot; the witness, but there was no evidence of any effort expended to locate him or to have a subpoena issued. Appellant claimed that the trial court erred in charging the jury on contributory negligence under S.C. Code &sect; 15-1-300 (1976). The trial judge incorrectly stated that if appellant's contributory negligence equaled the negligence of respondent such would bar recovery, whereas the statute provided a bar to recovery only if the contributory negligence of appellant exceeded the negligence of respondent. The court concluded that the jury was not misled by the charge because the judge fully charged the correct law at the appropriate stage of his charge.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled in favor of the Authority. Plaintiff appealed, claiming that the Act did not serve a public purpose, it pledged the State's credit for the benefit of private corporations and individuals in violation of the South Carolina Constitution, and it improperly delegated legislative authority. On appeal, the court affirmed and ruled that the Act's benefit to private individuals of private ownership of the housing was merely incidental to the important public purpose of providing safe and affordable housing and eliminating the by-products of substandard housing. The State's credit was not pledged because the state was not subject to pecuniary liability for any debt or loan made in furtherance of the Act's programs. And finally, the Act did not improperly delegate legislative authority because the Authority was not vested with absolute discretion in carrying out the objective of providing affordable, safe housing but was required to act within the specific parameters of the Act.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial court's judgment, holding that it was error for the trial court to include the comparative negligence statute in his charge. The court held that S.C. Code &sect; 15-1-300 (1976) violated the equal protection clause because it applied to only one class of individuals, those involved in motor vehicle accidents. While the general assembly had the right to make reasonable classifications of persons and property for public purpose, the classification could not be purely arbitrary and had to rest upon some reasonable basis. The court concluded that there was no rational basis for separating injuries from motor vehicle accidents from injuries from other torts.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State asserted that defendant and another man lured two victims to an area to kill them. Defendant claimed that he had no prior knowledge that murder was contemplated. The appellate court affirmed in large part except for the death penalty issue. Changes in venue were subject to an abuse of discretion standard. The trial court adequately examined the potential jury on pretrial publicity. The trial court adequately asked the jury the proper statutory questions. The fact that a juror was related to an attorney's secretary did not call for her removal. The trial court properly excused a juror who was opposed to capital punishment under all circumstances. Alleged error in the failure to admonish the jury was not raised below and could not be reviewed. Miranda did not apply to statements by defendant while he was not in custody. Other statements were admissible because defendant voluntarily waived his Miranda rights. Evidence of another death was admissible because it showed a common scheme or plan. Defendant lacked standing to object to the seizure of a gun and shoes from his co-defendant. In defendant's favor, case law held that his death sentence was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 40-9-30 (1976), the statute that created the Board. The action also alleged that the Board wrongfully and arbitrarily denied the chiropractors licenses to practice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board contended that the chiropractors lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 40-9-30. It argued that because the actions of the Board would have been valid de facto if the Board was unconstitutional, the chiropractors suffered no injury by virtue of the Board's unconstitutionality. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the chiropractors suffered an injury sufficient to give them standing. The court found that if the Board was unconstitutionally created, the chiropractors had been denied the privilege of practicing chiropractic in South Carolina by an unlawful administrative body and continued to be subject to its authority. The Board also alleged that the chiropractors could not challenge &sect; 40-9-30 without first complying with S.C. Code Ann. &sect;15-63-60 (1976). The court found that the chiropractors had standing to challenge S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 40-9-30 and were necessarily given the permission of the trial court when it heard their motion for summary judgment. Finally, the court found that &sect; 40-9-30 on its face violated S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 1 by unconstitutionally delegating appointive power to a private organization.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that: (1) the evidence presented a jury issue on the question of defendant's mental capacity to distinguish between right and wrong; (2) the medical testimony and the fact that defendant was able to comprehend and follow his attorney's instructions, established that defendant was competent to stand trial; (3) it was reasonable to conclude from the medical testimony that the medications enabled defendant to assist counsel in an effective manner; (4) there was nothing to indicate the medications undermined defendant's sanity defense; and (5) because defendant was sentenced to death under a statute declared unconstitutional, the court remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The Commission sought review of the determination of the company's proper rate base.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company contended that the trial court erred in failing to find that the Commission's determination of a fair rate of return was unlawful, unreasonable, and unconstitutional. On review, the court found that the utility did not carry its burden of proving that the Commission's order was unlawful or unreasonable as required by S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 58-9-1450 (1976). The Commission's order, insofar as it concluded that the company was entitled to a return on common equity between 8 and 11 percent, was supported by the evidence and was neither capricious nor arbitrary. Even assuming that the allowed rate of return was somewhat low, it was not so low as to be a deprivation of property without due process of law. In determining the just and reasonable rate under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 58-9-570 (1976), the trial court properly required the Commission to determine whether the property held for future use, which the company sought to include in its rate base, was in fact bought in good faith for future utility use or for speculation. The refusal of the Commission to consider a wage increase in the test year data was arbitrary and capricious because its effect was known and measurable.</SPAN></P>

The State, in seeking to clarify the law, filed petitions seeking a remand of each case for resentencing in light of the new law because at the time of each sentencing, although the new law was in effect, defendants were not sentenced pursuant to the manner prescribed by the Act of 1977. The court denied the State's petition and ordered that the circuit courts resentence all defendant to life imprisonment. The court held that it was the intent of the Act of 1977 that no one suffer the death penalty unless both stages of the bifurcated trial was conducted consistent with the Act, and thus, the death penalty could not be applied to defendants tried before its enactment. The court concluded that were it to grant the State's petition to resentence these defendants under the Act of 1977, a number of the safeguards provided within the statute would be unavailable; therefore, defendants could not, consistent with due process, be sentenced under the provisions of the Act of 1977.</SPAN></P>

The pedestrian appealed, and the court reversed the lower court, holding that &sect; 15-3-640 violated equal protection principles. The court noted that &sect; 15-3-640 granted to architects, engineers, and contractors immunity from liability for their torts 10 years after the substantial completion of the improvement which caused the damages. No rational basis existed, the court ruled, for distinguishing between the protected class and building owners and supply manufacturers, who were not protected by the statute. The court rejected as distinguishable case law cited by the architect because it involved statutes furthering a legitimate legislative purpose.</SPAN></P>

The wife alleged that by S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 21-7-480 (Law. Co-op. 1976) limited the daughter's interest to one fourth of the property devised because she was illegitimate. The trial court entered judgment for the daughter and the wife appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 21-7-480 provided that if a resident of South Carolina fathered an illegitimate child, while he had a wife or lawful children of his own living, any gift he made by legacy or devise was limited to no more than one fourth of his estate. On review of the judgment for the daughter, the court found that the statute was inapplicable and it was not necessary to determine whether or not the daughter was is illegitimate. It was undisputed that the daughter was born prior to the marriage of the wife and the deceased. Therefore, the trial court correctly concluded that since the deceased did not beget any illegitimate child while having a wife, the provisions of &sect; 21-7-480 did not apply to the devise. The provisions of the statute applied to any person who begat any illegitimate child at the same time he had a wife or lawful children of his own living. The deceased was not married and had no lawful children at the time the daughter was born. Accordingly, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 7-13-750, which permitted a husband and wife to both enter the same voting booth and to converse while voting, was not unconstitutional.

</DIV>

The commission concluded that the statute was violative of S.C. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 1, 10 and declared its intent to disregard the statute. The trial court found that the statute was constitutional and enjoined the commission from not complying with the statute. The court reversed, and noted that under S.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 all elections were to be by secret ballot. The court noted that the state constitution mandated that the legislature insure secrecy in voting. The court found that while the allowance of husbands and wives to vote together had considerable appeal, there was no rationale by which brothers and sisters, parents and children, or consenting friends could not vote together. The court held that while in some circumstances the right to secrecy could be waived, the overall purpose of the secrecy provision was to insure the integrity of elections. The court found no rational basis why the mandate of secrecy should be relaxed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the issues included whether the denial of his motion for continuance was erroneous, whether the trial court should have declared the then-existing death penalty statute unconstitutional, and whether statements defendant made to law enforcement officers after he had allegedly requested an attorney should have been excluded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the testimony was contradictory, defendant might have requested an attorney during an initial interrogation. But, later, he made a written statement containing an express waiver of his right to have an attorney present and he voluntarily took a polygraph examination. He then made another voluntary statement to police. Later, he provided law enforcement officials with more information. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly admitted defendant's statements. Even assuming he did request counsel following his initial interrogation, he subsequently waived his right to have an attorney present. The court held that there was no abuse of discretion by the trial court in its refusal to grant a continuance, which was based on the heavy caseload of the public defender, the notoriety of the case, and the fact that the public defender's investigator suffered a heart attack just prior to trial. He was not thereby denied assistance of counsel. Defendant's arguments concerning the constitutionality of the death penalty and the propriety of bifurcating his trial were moot given that he was sentenced to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

The employee's employer opened its book store for business at a new address without a business license. The employee was arrested and convicted for managing and operating without a business license.

VIII, &sect;&sect; 8, 10, although the only area to which it applied was the town, where it was general in form, where it applied to all areas falling within the class established and excluded none from its application who reasonably should have been included, and where its purpose was to permit persons acting in good faith compliance with existing incorporation requirements to complete their incorporation process under the law in effect prior to the statute's effective date. The court also held that any defects in the election of town officers were cured by the enactment of 1977 S.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of safecracking in separate cases. Each defendant was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Defendants' appeals were consolidated for review. Defendants contended that a 10 year minimum sentence for safecracking with tools constituted cruel and unusual punishment and was in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VIII. Precedent in South Carolina was that a court had no jurisdiction to disturb a statute that authorized an excessive sentence unless the statute itself violated S.C. Const. art. 1, &sect; 19, which outlawed cruel and unusual punishment or the sentence was the result of partiality, prejudice, oppression, or corrupt motive. The court looked at whether a sentence of 10 years imprisonment was in proportion to the crime of safecracking and found that crimes punishable with a lesser sentence were often crimes of passion or heat of the moment crimes where safecracking was more likely done by a professional criminal who was less likely to be rehabilitated. The court found the 10-year minimum sentence was not cruel and unusual punishment and did not deny equal protection to those convicted of that offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the taxpayer claimed that the city, in enacting its tax ordinance for the 1975-1976 fiscal year, acted in violation of the S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 29 by setting the tax levy prior to ascertaining with certainty the total value of all property subject to tax. The court held that an examination of the South Carolina Constitution revealed no such requirement. The Constitution did require an assessment as a prerequisite for the imposition of a valid tax but as the term was used in the various provisions of the Constitution, assessment related to the appraisal process by which a value was assigned to individual parcels of real and personal property. The city council was not required to wait until the total of all assessments could be known with certainty but in the exercise of its legislative function could proceed on the basis of past experience and the best available estimate of revenue, as was done in the instant case. The taxpayer's increased taxes resulted from his increased assessment and not from any action of the city.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from he General Sessions Court of Greenville County (South Carolina), which convicted him of two counts of murder, assault and battery with intent to kill, armed robbery, and carrying a concealed weapon, and which sentenced him to death by electrocution and, in the event the death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, and also to serve a combined total of 45 years and 30 days for the remainder of his crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot three people, killing two, during armed robbery. In addition to the guilty verdicts, the jury found him not guilty of murder while in the commission of robbery while armed with a deadly weapon. Defendant claimed insanity. In affirming the convictions the court first held that the trial court did not err in excluding statements made by defendant to his physician concerning his life before the crimes and statements made by defendant's employers to the physician. The court noted that the jury had the benefit of the physician's opinion which was based in part on this excluded evidence. The court next agreed that the verdicts were inconsistent but held that the error did not prejudice defendant because under the facts defendant clearly committed all the charged crimes. Where a State's reply witness had only been called after defendant, without notice, put on evidence of insanity, there was no violation of the sequestration order even though this witness had been present during the trial. The court reversed the imposition of the death penalty, leaving appellant subject to the constitutional life sentence provision of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-52 (Supp. 1975).</SPAN></P>

He contended that the trial court erred by overruling his contention that compliance with the notice provisions was mandatory and a prerequisite to the exercise of the power of the court to declare him an habitual offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Highway Department admitted that no notice was given to the motorist at any time that he was in danger of becoming an habitual offender, as directed by S.C. Code. Ann. &sect; 46-197.12. On appeal, the court held as an initial matter that the declared purpose of &sect; 46-197 was to promote safety on the highways by imposing additional penalties on habitual offenders by institution of court action to have a motorist declared an habitual offender. The court further held that the notice requirements were not a condition precedent to a determination of whether one was an habitual offender. The court reasoned that if the events leading up to habitual offender status had occurred in a short period of time, the Department would not be able to notify a motorist that he or she was in danger of achieving habitual offender status, and the legislature clearly did not seek to reward motorists whose conduct had brought them with habitual offender status in this manner. The authority was unconditionally granted to a court to impose the habitual offender penalties, absent a provision making the imposition dependent on the notice provisions of &sect; 46-197.12.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge granted the homeowners summary judgment because the builder did not have a license when the contract was executed. S.C.

The owners asserted that the statute required the builder to obtain a license immediately after July 1, 1974, in order to legally continue to operate his business. The court held that the statute allowed an established residential homebuilder 12 months in which to legally continue his operation and obtain the requisite license.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in a trial court (South Carolina) of murder while in the commission of robbery while armed with a deadly weapon. He was sentenced to die by electrocution under S.C. Code &sect; 16-52 (Cum. Supp. 1975). On appeal, the issues included whether a mistrial should have been granted either because he was never arraigned on the particular indictment upon which he was convicted or due to misconduct by the solicitor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that there was no merit to defendant's arguments that the want of arraignment constituted a denial of his due process rights or that rearraignment on a second indictment was essential to a valid conviction. Because he was arraigned on an identical armed robbery murder charge at an earlier trial, which ended in a mistrial, there was no need for a second arraignment. Further, allegations of inflammatory and prejudicial statements made by the solicitor during closing argument were not supported by the record. Although, arguably, defendant's contentions that the restriction of the scope of his cross-examination of a reply witness denied his federal constitutional right of confrontation and was an abuse of the trial court's discretion were not preserved at trial, there was no merit to them anyway. Further, absent prejudice, a new trial was not warranted. The documentary records of a lineup procedure were properly admitted on the issue of identity.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petition taxpayers filed an action asking the court to construe S.C. Const. art. VIII and determine whether 1975 S.C. Acts 283, 1975 S.C. Acts 448, and 1976 S.C. Acts 467 were repugnant under that new article of the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The acts and constitutional provision at issue related to local government and were often referred to as &quot;home rule.&quot; The taxpayers alleged that the acts were repugnant to the new article of the South Carolina Constitution, S.C. Const. art. VIII. In an effort to comply with the constitutional mandate, the General Assembly passed 1975 S.C. Acts 283, which created five alternative forms of county government. Under Form 5, the Board of Commissioners had no authority to levy taxes or appropriate money. The court ruled that Form 5 of Act 283 was unconstitutional under S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 7 because it permitted a county to carry on business as before, after the people, speaking through the constitution, mandated a change. It was impossible for a county to operate under Form 5 without enactment by the General Assembly of laws for a specific county. If a county, operating under Form 5, needed to levy ad valorem taxes or establish agency departments, it would have to have the approval of the General Assembly. The court found that 1975 S.C. Acts 448 and 1976 S.C. Acts 467 were constitutionally permissible as &quot;one-shot&quot; propositions, in view of S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that a portion of one of the acts was unconstitutional. The court sustained the constitutionality of the remaining portions of the acts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder while committing an armed robbery. Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-52, he was mandatorily sentenced to death. On appeal he challenged his death sentence arguing that &sect; 16-52 was unconstitutional. The state supreme court granted review of defendant's appeal. The United States Supreme Court had recently held that mandatory death sentences in specified circumstances which left neither judge nor jury discretion to impose a lesser sentences violated the U.S. Const. amend. VIII prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Accordingly, the state supreme court found that the mandatory death provision under the aggravated circumstances enumerated in &sect; 16-52 was unconditional. Defendant's conviction of murder was affirmed but the imposition of the death penalty was reversed and the case was remanded for the purpose of sentencing defendant to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 32-1510.49 (Supp. 1975), which created a rebuttable statutory presumption of intent to sell by reason of possession of more than 28 grams of marijuana, had been held constitutional in the absence of any evidence in the record to substantiate the contention of constitutional invalidity. Here defendant claimed that the trial court denied him due process by refusing his proffer of testimony concerning the reasonableness of the presumption. In affirming the conviction the court stated that generally speaking the validity of a presumption was a question of law for the trial court. While it was conceivable that evidence might be incidentally helpful in the judicial inquiry, the court was also mindful that the legislature's opinion, as indicated in the statute, was constitutionally entitled to deference. Because defendant possessed more than four pounds of marijuana, the court found expert opinion as to the presumption unnecessary to the decision. The court also held that the test for the reasonableness of a presumption was whether the presumed fact more likely than not followed from the evidentiary fact. The beyond a reasonable doubt standard did not control this test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged election was held by the Authority to authorize the acquisition and operation of a wastewater treatment facility. The trial court held that Act No. 542 was unconstitutional. This portion of the judgment was not appealed. Since Act No. 542 was void however the Authority had no standing to appeal any part of the judgment, and its appeal was dismissed. The trial court also held that pursuant to S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 16, an election was necessary to authorize the acquisition. The court agreed, and also agreed that the constitutional provision was self-executing. Siding with the taxpayer however the court disagreed with the conclusion that the election to authorize the acquisition of the facility was properly authorized. The election was called by the Authority, not the county. The Authority had no right to call the election; it was not the governing body of the county or of a consolidated political subdivision as defined by S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 12. The court then held that the county board had no independent authority to acquire the facility, because S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 16, superceded the Revenue Bond Act for Utilities, S.C.

Acts 288, which expanded the powers of the Housing Authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1975 S.C. Acts 288 authorized the Housing Authority to, in part, issue notes and bonds in order to finance private housing and delineated various programs to provide housing to persons of moderate to low income. Appellant unsuccessfully challenged its constitutionality below the lower court, and appealed. The court found in favor of appellant. The court noted that 1975 S.C. Acts 288 &sect; 14A provided that all rules and regulations promulgated by the Housing Authority were void if the General Assembly did not approve them by concurrent resolution at the session following their promulgation. The court said that the various programs provided by parts of 1975 S.C. Acts 288 could not take effect without legislative approval, and that those parts of the Act were not severable from the Act because their inclusion altered the import of the remainder of the Act. The court noted that the Act could have, but did not, set forth reporting requirements of the Housing Authority, further evidencing the need and legislative intent for legislative supervision.

The court held that venue in the county where the victim was probably shot, but not where her body was found, was proper under S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, as amended (Supp. 1975). The court also held that the State solicitor's questions regarding defendant's prior criminal activity were within the permissible scope of inquiry because defendant had described these activities on direct examination. Further, the solicitor limited his comments to evidence in the record. With regard to the offense of kidnapping, the court held that defendant's desire to avoid arrest by taking the victim was sufficient to constitute the &quot;ransom or reward&quot; requirement of S.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer's dredging equipment was in the county on December 31, 1970, and thus tax was assessed on it pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 65-1644 (1962). The taxpayer removed the property a few months into 1971, and claimed therefore that the tax should be apportioned in correspondence to the amount of time the property was in the county. In affirming the judgment the court first noted that neither &sect; 65-1644 nor any other law permitted or required apportionment. The court then held that the refusal to apportion the tax did not violate the taxpayer's rights to due process under S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, or U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The state could levy a tax so long as it was a quid pro quo for the protection, opportunities, and benefits given by the state. It did not matter that the taxpayer's benefit was nebulous or that the benefits in general were not proportionally distributed. Nor did it matter that the taxpayer was fully taxed in two states without apportionment, as double taxation required an identity of taxing authority. The treasurer was not estopped by judicial apportionment of the prior year's tax to exact the full year's tax this year.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial in the Horry County Circuit Court (South Carolina) defendant was convicted of the murder of a law enforcement officer, and sentenced to death pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-52 (1962). On appeal, defendant challenged both the conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction stemmed from the death of a game warden that purportedly occurred while defendant, his brother and a companion were on a deer drive. After the warden and his partner directed the three to leave a prohibited area, he was fatally shot while trying to fix a cable that was used to border the area. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence for the following reasons. Though there was pre-trial publicity about the case, because it was not inflammatory but factual in nature, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a change of venue. Neither was there an abuse of discretion in the trial court's refusal to sever defendant's trial from that of his codefendant, though their defenses were antagonistic. In so ruling, the court referred to precedent which, under similar circumstances, upheld denials of severance, and found that defendant did not provide a sufficient rationale to distinguish his case therefrom. Based on the evidence, there was no error in refusing to either set aside the verdict or grant defendant a new trial. Lastly, the court rejected the federal and state constitutional attacks upon &sect; 16-52 (1962).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Having declared unconstitutional the acts creating or conferring jurisdiction on several courts, the court declared the effect of the acts of these courts. The court declared that the judges of these courts had been de facto judges, and rejected the contention that because there had been no legal office the judges occupied, there could be no judges. The court declined to declare void all the acts of these judges. As the public and the various parties who had come before all these judges were concerned, a de facto judge was a de jure judge. So the court held immune from collateral attack the acts of the judges whose judgeships were, by legislative statutes, created after April 4, 1973, as additional judgeships within courts already in existence. The court made the same declaration with respect to four courts and their judges which did not exist on April 4, 1973, and which were brought into being legislatively since that date. The court allocated their pending cases to other de jure courts. As to seven other courts whose jurisdiction was altered unconstitutionally, their acts too were validated, though henceforth they had no more or less authority than they had on April 4, 1973.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court validated all of the acts of the various courts taken during the period when the courts acted without constitutional authority.</SPAN></P>

The court divided the actions into four groups and found that the cases that contested statutes that undertook to change the jurisdiction of the court involved were unconstitutional. The court noted that the courts that existed had to revert back to the same power each had before the change. The second group was those that attempted to create new local courts and the court found them unconstitutional. The third groups which created additional judgeships for courts already in existence was invalid as were the fourth group that related to acts concerning several courts of probate.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The South Carolina General Assembly created a special purpose district to serve as an airport. Later, an act was passed permitting the commissioners to issue general obligation bonds of the district and to use such funds for the construction, enlargement, improvement and extension of the airport facilities. Payment of the bonds was to be by an annual ad valorem tax upon all taxable property within the district sufficient to pay the principal and interest on the bonds as they become due. The taxpayer filed an action on behalf of all property owners situated in the district for a declaratory judgment finding the act unconstitutional. The trial court upheld the validity of the act, and the taxpayer appealed. The court affirmed. The taxpayer contended that the act was unconstitutional under S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 7, which provided for the powers and duties of counties. However, the special district was not a county, and the prohibition of &sect; 7 only meant that no law could be passed relating to a specific county.

Thereafter, she brought contempt proceedings, and the husband was found in contempt for failing to pay. Later, the husband filed a motion to modify the previous orders based on a material change of condition in his health and financial ability to pay. The trial court refused to modify its orders and granted the wife a money judgment. On appeal, the husband contended that the trial court erred in failing to vacate or modify the ordered support payments for a certain period of time. The court found that while there was evidence that he was partially disabled during some of that time and that due to a change in his professional employment his earning capacity was substantially reduced, the trial court properly denied the motion. He had an earning capacity in 1972 of $ 200,000.00, and he had returned to an earning capacity of $ 100,000.00 per annum. In the intervening time, he was a man of sufficient property and means to meet the payments. Finally, he could not raise the issue of whether compelling him to pay his wife's attorney's fees constituted arbitrary discrimination, as he did not raise the issue below.</SPAN></P>

Acts 1097, was constitutional and that it did not violate any provisions of the Constitution of the United States or of the State of South Carolina. The lower court denied the taxpayer's request for an injunction and dismissed the complaint filed against defendants, mayor, councilmen, and attorney general.</SPAN></P>

Code of Laws &sect; 10-2001 et seq. (1962) which contested the constitutionality of 1974 S.C. Acts 1097 (the Bond Act), which sought to improve and maintain land in the county through the raising of revenue. The taxpayer argued that the Bond Act was unconstitutional in that it provided for the use of public funds for private purposes. Specifically, it was the acquisition of real estate to be leased to private persons, firms, or corporations. The lower court denied the taxpayer's request for an injunction and dismissed the complaint. The court reversed the lower court's judgment because defendants pleaded no public purpose. The court noted that the Bond Act undertook to permit the city to promote business undertakings which would compete in free enterprise with other businesses which did not have the advantage that the Bond Act gave. The court concluded that defendants failed to convince the court that the authority granted by the Bond Act to the municipalities involved a public purpose as contrasted with a private purpose, and accordingly the court held the Bond Act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act provided that in Charleston County, South Carolina, every new building, addition, renovation or other improvement to real property should be returned for taxation, and was taxable, as of the first day of the calendar month after it is first occupied. It thus provides for a pro rata taxation of improvements to realty in Charleston County during the year of initial occupancy. The Act undertook to apply a different rule for returning property in Charleston County than the generally applicable statute, &sect; 65-1620 of 1962 Code, as amended (South Carolina), which applied statewide. Under &sect; 65-1620, other landowners in South Carolina under similar circumstances were not required to return improvements and pay taxes on them until the following calendar year. The court held that the Act was clearly violative of art. 3, &sect; 34(IX), of the South Carolina Constitution, which provided that no special law could be enacted where a general law could be made applicable. Because the court held that the Act was unconstitutional under art. 3, &sect; 34(IX), it expressly refrained from holding as to the applicability, if any, of art. 8, &sect; 7, of the South Carolina Constitution, to the Act.</SPAN></P>

Alleging that defects in the highway contributed to the accident, the committee brought an action against the county and the highway department. Because a verified claim had not been filed within the 180-day limit of S.C. Code of Laws &sect;&sect; 33-230, 33-923 (1962), respondents contended that the action was time-barred. The committee argued that the application of the time bar was an unconstitutional denial of due process and equal protection. She claimed that the time limit was arbitrary and capricious because it served no public purpose, deprived her of a vested right to seek redress for damages, and impermissibly distinguished between private tortfeasors and public tortfeasors. In affirming the judgment that sustained respondents' demurrers, the court held that the Legislature could condition the waiver of sovereign immunity on compliance with the claim procedure. As there was no inherent right to sue the State or its subdivisions and agencies, the committee had not been denied a vested right and there was no discrimination against the victims of public tortfeasors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act empowered the South Carolina State Housing Authority to issue its notes or bonds to promote housing accommodations for persons of moderate to low income. Article 10, &sect; 6 of the South Carolina Constitution provided that the credit of the State was not to be pledged or loaned for the benefit of any individual, company, association or corporation. The lower court ruled in favor of the citizen, finding that the Act violated Article 10, &sect; 6. On appeal, the court affirmed the ruling, holding that the Act committed the State of South Carolina and, by so doing, pledged its credit to make good any deficit arising because of default under both a direct mortgage loan program and a mortgage purchase program. The fact that such deficit would be paid out of the guaranty fund, instead of the general fund of the state, made the obligation no less a pledge of the credit of the state. Because those provisions relating to the guaranty fund were unconstitutional, the remainder of the Act was invalid as well, because the programs were so interdependent for their funding and repayment and so intertwined that all of the programs were objectionable as violative of Article 10, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's contention that a sentence of life imprisonment resulting from a wrongful killing caused by the use of an automobile was cruel and unusual punishment in violation of both the South Carolina Constitution and the United States Constitution. The court stated that it had upheld a similar verdict of murder resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle. The court further found that even if the sentence of life imprisonment was infrequently inflicted in cases involving a wrongful killing with a motor vehicle, it did not render the application of the murder statute in an automobile killing case unconstitutional.

The trial court denied the corporation's claim so the corporation appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held the state had a right to levy an income tax upon income derived by nonresidents from property within the state or from business carried on within the state. The court ruled that since the corporation attacked a formula of apportionment, the corporation had a distinct burden of showing by clear and cogent evidence that the formula resulted in extraterritorial values being taxed. Unless there was a palpably disproportionate result, the court was unwilling to nullify honest state efforts to make apportionments. The court found the business was unitary in nature so its income was attributable to all incidents of the business and not to a single activity. The court held the allocation of 55.5 percent of the corporation's income to the state was not unreasonable and the application of the formula did not depart from the requirements of &sect; 65-222.2.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 47-11 to -17 (1962), which required an election without a referendum where more than 50 percent of the freeholders in such area signed the petition. After an annexation election, the area was annexed to the city. The corporations, which owned property but did not reside in such area, filed an action against the city and the council members to declare the annexation procedure void. On appeal from a judgment against the corporation, the court held that: (1) the procedures under &sect; 47-11 to -17 were valid and the most expeditious alternative to the city council; (2) the &quot;word description&quot; provided an adequate description of the area annexed because it was not misleading, and it contained well-known boundaries that were ascertainable from public records; and (3) the corporations were not registered qualified electors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed their convictions for exhibiting obscene motion pictures. The court affirmed. Defendants argued that the films were improperly admitted into evidence. They alleged that the search warrant lacked sufficient particularity in the description of the property to be seized because the title of the films was not stated in the warrant. However, the affidavit, which was part of the search warrant, left no doubt as to the films to be seized. The fact that the title to the films was not stated in the warrant did not render any less definite the identity of the films, in view of the detailed description of the contents and the description in the affidavit. Since the affidavit showed probable cause, the search warrant issued pursuant thereto afforded ample legal authority for the seizure of the property described therein and its admission into evidence. A further evidentiary hearing was not required under the present facts. The court found no merit in any of defendants attacks upon the constitutionality of the pertinent obscenity statutes, Section 16-414.1 et seq., 1962 Code of Laws (South Carolina). The jury instructions were proper as well.</SPAN></P>

The prosecutrix then identified defendant at the sheriff's department in a showup through a one-way mirror. The following day, the prosecutrix identified defendant in a lineup. At trial, the State did not introduce testimony relating to either the showup or the lineup identification. Rather, the State proceeded solely upon the prosecutrix's in-court identification. Defendant argued that the in-court identification was tainted by the pretrial identifications, which he alleged were conducted in violation of his right to counsel and without due process of law. In rejecting that argument and affirming the conviction, the court found that even if there was a constitutional violation, there was competent evidence to support a finding that the in-court identification had a source independent of any unconstitutional pretrial identification. The prosecutrix's identification was made a short time after the incident and was highly specific before she ever saw defendant in custody.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court rejected defendant's argument that a directed verdict should have been entered in his favor. The court concluded that the circumstances were sufficient to warrant an inference of guilt, thus requiring the trial judge to submit the issue to the jury. The court noted that defendant's contention as to the inadmissibility of his confession was premised upon a factual conflict which was resolved against him by the trial judge. Because the judge's conclusions were clearly supported by the evidence, the court concluded that the trial judge had not erred in admitting the challenged confession. Defendant also challenged the validity of the imposition of the death penalty. At the time of trial, &sect; 16-52 of the Code of Laws of South Carolina (1962) provided for the death penalty in a case of murder, unless the jury recommended mercy. The solicitor and the trial judge took the position that the mercy proviso section was unconstitutional and tried the case as if the statute provided that whoever was guilty of murder was subject to the death penalty. The court held that the trial court erred in imposing the death penalty and, vacating the death penalty, remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the board was not required to grant an adversary hearing in passing upon an application for a charter to establish a savings and loan association because 8-51-62 directed that it conduct an investigation of each application and make its determination upon the basis of such investigation. The association argued that because the decision was made with the board convening on a conference call, due process was violated. The court noted that such investigation was made and that the association and other interested parties were afforded every opportunity to present such facts that could have had a bearing upon the ultimate determination. In addition to the conference call, the board met twice again on the matter, therefore, the proceedings met the requirements of procedural due process.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment in favor of plaintiff property owner in her action to contest the right of the district to issue general obligation bonds and to have Acts 259 and 643 of the 1973 Session of the South Carolina General Assembly declared unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The South Carolina Constitution was amended, adding Article VIII. Section 7 of that article provided that the General Assembly was no longer allowed to enact laws for specific counties. Nonetheless, after Article VIII was added, the Assembly enacted Acts No. 259 and 436 in the 1973 General Session, which created the recreation district commission and granted the commission the power to issue bonds. The property owner sued the commission to contest its right to issue the bonds and to have the Acts declared unconstitutional. The trial court entered judgment for the owner. The court affirmed. The court held that the intent in adding Article VIII was to remove the Assembly's power to micromanage county affairs and vest it in county governments. Nothing about Article VII prevented the creation of special purpose districts; it only vested that power in the counties. The fact that the Assembly had not enacted legislation to enact general laws establishing county functions did not give it the power to keep on passing special laws. Also, the Assembly did not retain the inherent power to carve out special districts. Article VIII, &sect; 16 gave it to the counties themselves.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A property owner, whose land was leased and used for manufacturing purposes, filed suit seeking a refund of property taxes paid under protest. The owner contended that the application of a 9.5 percent ratio in assessing her property for taxation rather than the 4.2 percent ratio used in assessing the property in the county by the local authority, resulted in the unequal and non-uniform taxation of properties of similar value in violation the equal protection guarantees of the State and Federal Constitutions. The court reversed the trial court's judgment for the owner and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court concluded that there was nothing that prohibited the General Assembly from classifying property according to its use so long as such classification was reasonable and not arbitrary, and the tax imposed was uniform on the same class of property. The court found a clear intent of the General Assembly to place in a separate classification all property used in manufacturing whether owned or leased to a manufacturer. The owner's property fell within this classification and the determination of its assessed value by the application of the 9.5 percent ratio was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with three counts of armed robbery. He pleaded guilty to each charge. He was sentenced under &sect; 16-333 of the Code. His request to the trial judge to be sentenced under the Youthful Offender Act (Act) was refused. He argued that the trial judge's failure to sentence him under the Act denied him the same benefits afforded other youthful offenders under the Act, and, therefore, he was not accorded equal protection of the law under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court found that it was implicit from the trial judge's finding that defendant would derive no benefit from being sentenced under the Youthful Offender Act because he had a lengthy criminal history, which included petty larceny, shoplifting, unauthorized use of motor vehicles, robbery with force, second degree burglary, and carrying a dangerous weapon. The trial judge's discretionary power to sentence defendant under the offense statute rather than the Act did not deny him equal protection because U.S. Const. amend. XIV permitted qualitative differences in sentencing and did not require that two persons convicted of the same offense receive the same sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers filed a complaint for declaratory relief against defendants, a county and a large corporation. The county had entered into an agreement with the corporation pursuant to which the corporation acquired the right to lease 100.62 acres of land for up to 99 years, with an option to purchase. The taxpayers contended the lease was invalid, and sought review of an adverse judgment of a South Carolina court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the terms of a lease, in lieu of cash lease payments, a corporation committed to placing certain capital improvements on the premises. Taxpayers contended that the transaction constituted a &quot;donation&quot; of State lands. After considering the pleadings, testimony, and arguments, the court concluded that the transaction was in the public interest and constituted a valid exercise of the county's discretion. The court determined that the transaction was based on fair and reasonable consideration because the county could properly consider the indirect benefits that would accrue to it as the result of the corporation's establishment within county boundaries, including prospective tax revenues from the improvements. Further, the court held that the South Carolina Constitution afforded no constitutional prohibition to the transaction because it applied only to lands held by the State in its capacity as sovereign proprietor. Nor did the court find that the county had violated any fiduciary duty it owed to its taxpayers and citizens in effectuating the transaction. Thus, the court approved the dismissal of the taxpayers' complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court adopted the judgment ordering that the taxpayers' complaint for declaratory relief against the county and the corporation be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

Acts 585 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were successors to trustees who initially leased the academy's schools to the public school district. Eventually, the predecessors of plaintiffs leased to defendants, in perpetuity, the academy's two school properties. 1971 S.C. Acts 585, the Act in controversy, purported to eliminate the provision for the appointment by the Governor of two academy recommended school commissioners, who were, instead, to be chosen by popular election. The Act also purported to repeal the 1795 statutory charter of the academy, and to transfer to the school district all real property to which the academy held title. The court found that the academy's 1795 statutory charter vested full control of the academy in their trustees and gave them the right to choose their successors. It unmistakably showed the private character of the corporation. The court concluded that the academy's charter was a contract protected against impairment by both the state and federal constitutions. Accordingly, the court held that so much of the 1971 statute as undertook to rescind the academy's charter was clearly unconstitutional as violative of S.C. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 5 and 17, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

Notwithstanding the fact that South Carolina did not require the material be utterly without redeeming social value, the trial judge charged that the jury had to so find. Defendant was given the benefit of the charge and could not be heard to complaint because the charge was more favorable to him than required.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An Oregon manufacturer distributed its products, including a coupler unit, through a Virginia distributor to southeastern states, including South Carolina. The manufacturer had no place of business in South Carolina but listed itself in local phone books and sold products there for over 15 years. The manufacturer also advertised in South Carolina. After a South Carolina resident was killed in an incident involving the alleged failure of the manufacturer's coupler unit, the manufacturer sent an agent to South Carolina to investigate. The administrator of the decedent's estate filed tort claims against the manufacturer in a South Carolina trial court, which denied the manufacturer's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. On appeal, the court examined &sect; 12-23.14 and found that the state had long extended the reach of its jurisdiction to the limits of due process. On these facts, the court found that the manufacturer had been &quot;doing business&quot; in the state, as the statute required, and that requiring it to answer claims in a South Carolina court did not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

In the process of escaping from a police pursuit, one of the co-defendants shot and killed a deputy. Defendant was convicted of felony murder. The court affirmed the conviction over defendant's objection that the common law felony murder rule was unconstitutional. The court noted that it was not considering or deciding whether any felony could form the basis for a felony murder conviction. However, in this case the felony was malum in se, and malice could be properly inferred from the actions. The court noted the inherent danger of breaking and entry of a private residence to commit larceny in the daytime. In addition, the court noted that the crime was committed by well-armed felons and concluded that the conviction under the felony-murder doctrine was fully justified under the circumstances of this case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act authorized the issuance by the state of bonds to obtain funds out of which loans would be made by the State to municipalities and special purpose districts to enable the local units to get maximum financial benefit from Federal programs for the construction of sewage, treatment, and disposal systems. Appellants claimed that the Act authorized the State to incur debt without an election, in violation of Article 10, &sect; 11, of the South Carolina Constitution. The lower court held that the bonds did not constitute a debt of the State within Article 10, &sect; 11, based on the special fund doctrine. On appeal, the court found the Act unconstitutional. The special fund doctrine did not apply because there was no fund established or set aside to pay the obligations without resorting to the levy of property tax. Instead, the Act authorized the levy of property taxes in participating special purpose districts. There was nothing to show that water pollution control, as set forth in the Act, was such a local improvement as would confer any special benefit on the property owners in the local units so as to justify the ad valorem tax as an assessment for a benefit conferred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court refused defendant's motion to dismiss the charge on the ground that the statute defining the crime of disorderly conduct was vague, indefinite, and overbroad. The trial proceeded, and after the taking of all of the testimony, the trial court announced that it was going to find defendant guilty and withhold disposition. Thereafter, the trial court issued a written order holding as a matter of law that defendant was guilty, and disposition was withheld until further order. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court erred in refusing to hold that the statute was unconstitutionally vague, indefinite, and overbroad. The court ruled that it was unable to consider the question presented. The court was confined to the consideration of questions presented after final judgment had been rendered. Defendant was not sentenced, and until he was sentenced, there was no final judgment. It was clear that defendant's appeal, not being from a final judgment, was premature, and thus it had to be dismissed. To create finality in criminal cases for purpose of appeal, it was necessary that conviction be followed by sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cable company sent a notification letter of its intention to carry via cable television (CATV) the signals of several television stations. They began construction of a CATV system. The company entered into 56 signed contracts with customers, made connections into 31 homes, and was providing actual service to nine homes. Subsequently, 1972 S.C. Acts 1083 was enacted, which purported to confer upon the county the authority to grant franchise licenses for the operation of CATV. The county filed an action seeking to enjoin the company from operating or maintaining a CATV system in the county. The trial court denied the county's request. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the Act was unconstitutional because it singled out the county from others in the state as an area in which it was unlawful to operate a CATV system without a franchise license. Any attempt to regulate the CATV business in the county, while leaving unregulated the other CATV businesses in the state was unconstitutional. The court also held that the public utilities had broadly defined rights-of-way, which authorized the stringing of the company's cables from the existing telephone poles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was uncontradicted that defendant performed an abortion on a 30-year-old woman, who was three months or less pregnant. Defendant argued, however, that &sect; 16-83 was unconstitutional in light of the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade. Under &sect; 16-83, any person who was convicted of causing a miscarriage or abortion was to be punished by imprisonment, by fine, or by both. In Roe, the Court had held that a state criminal abortion statute that excepted from criminality only a life saving procedure on behalf of the mother, without regard to the stage of pregnancy and without recognition of the other interests involved, violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Under Roe, a first trimester abortion had to be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician. In reversing the conviction, the court found it apparent that South Carolina Code &sect; 16-83 would not meet the requirements placed upon it by Roe and was, therefore, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The developers cleared trees and created a right-of-way along the existing ditches in order to use equipment to widen and deepen the ditches. The landowners sought an injunction, which the trial court granted. The trial judge found that the developers had acquired an easement by prescription only with respect to the existing ditches, but that the developer was not allowed to increase the burden of the easement on the landowners' property. The court affirmed, holding first that a statute allowing for the improvement of ditches on subservient property was void as an unconstitutional taking of private property under S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 (1895). Next, the court held that the injunction was proper because the developer had entered the landowners' property without consent, and had destroyed trees, created a right-of-way for equipment, and substantially widened and deepened the existing ditches. This constituted an additional servitude upon the landowners' property, and a trespass to the extent of the unauthorized use.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession for sale of marihuana.

Defendant next alleged that there was insufficient evidence to have supported the conviction. Again the court disagreed and held that the state adequately showed that defendant had dominion and control over the marihuana. Defendant further argued that the police had no probable cause to have stopped the truck in which defendant was a passenger. The court found that the truck was stopped based on a valid policy by the police agency to have investigated all rental trucks leaving a certain area at night.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A person contacted a police chief, telling the police chief that the person was aware of a plan to break into a safe. The police chief met with a safecracker, who had been approached by persons planning a safecracking. The safecracker became an informant for the police. A stakeout was set up at a store, where the informant entered with defendants. The dial from a safe, which was located in the store, was knocked off. The informant then left the store and defendants were arrested. Defendants admitted the allegations of the indictments and relied solely on the defense of entrapment. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. The court found that S.C.

The court found that the general charge to the jury as to entrapment correctly stated the substance of the defense of entrapment. The evidence did not warrant the conclusion that the police chief instigated, induced, or lured defendants to violate the law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">South Carolina enacted the Act as a means to make, insure, and guarantee loans to students to defray their expenses at any institution of higher learning. Because the student borrowers were permitted to attend any institution of higher learning, including those sponsored by religious organizations, the taxpayers sought a declaration that the Act was unconstitutional. The trial court found in favor of the Attorney General. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the Act did not violate S.C. Const. art. XI, &sect; 9 because the aid, whether direct or indirect to higher education, was in the form of loans to student borrowers rather than to any institution or group of institutions. Also, the court held that the Act did not violate the establishment clauses of the South Carolina Constitution or the United States Constitution. The Act was scrupulously neutral as between religion and non-religious purposes and as between various religions. The Act was simply an aid to encourage South Carolina residents in the pursuit of higher education, leaving all eligible institutions free to compete for their attendance and dollars.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction arose out of the showing of the motion picture &quot;Anomalies&quot; on two occasions at a theater in Darlington. This film, graphically depicted a variety of bizarre and &quot;anomalous&quot; acts of perverted sex behavior by naked men and women. The court held that the fact that whether the motion picture exceeded the community standard of candor was a question of fact to be determined by the jury and that it was implicit in the jury's verdict that the film was found to be utterly without scientific, educational, artistic, or other social value. The court noted, having viewed the film, that the court was not inclined to disturb this finding. The court held that the trial judge properly charged the jury that the State had to prove three things, one of which was that the motion picture was &quot;utterly without redeeming social value.&quot; Finally, in its affirmance of the conviction, the court held that although Code of Laws of South Carolina (1962) &sect; 16-414.9 lacked the constitutionally-required certainty demanded by due process of law, Code of Laws of South Carolina (1962) &sect; 16-414.1 through &sect; 16-414.8 were valid because these sections were severable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission assessed a deficiency in corporate income and license taxes against the taxpayer based upon the taxpayer's sales revenues, after determining that most of the taxpayer's business in the state was attributable to sales. Thus, the commission calculated the taxes using the formula under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 65-279.8 (1962) for taxpayers who were principally engaged in selling in the state. The taxpayer sought a refund claiming that it was exclusively in the manufacturing business. Thus, it was entitled to employ the formula under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 65-279.7 (1962), to determine the taxes based on its manufacturing revenues in the state rather than sales, under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 65-279.8 (1962). The circuit court rejected the master's recommendation for a refund and entered judgment against the taxpayer. The taxpayer appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed and ruled that 95 percent of the taxpayer's income derived from the state resulted from sales of its steel goods. Thus, although nationally the taxpayer was viewed as a steel manufacturer, the taxpayer was principally engaged in the state in sales, within the meaning of S.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Tax Board of Review determined that the taxpayer's real property had been assessed at 10 percent of its actual value while other real property in the county had been assessed at 5 percent, it ordered a reduction in the real property assessment, but not the personal property. On appeal, the taxpayer argued that the valuation and assessment methods violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions, as well as S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 65-64(17). Finding no constitutional or statutory provision prohibiting the assessment of real property at a different rate than personal property, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. In so doing, the court held that the law merely required a uniform and equal rate of assessment and taxation per classification, and that so long as all members of a certain class were taxed uniformly and equally, constitutional due process and equal protection guarantees were satisfied. Further, the taxpayer's failure to present evidence regarding the true valuation of the property to the Tax Commission was fatal to its attempt to establish that the book value method did not produce the proper valuation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The act authorized counties to issue revenue bonds to finance the cost of air or water pollution control facilities to be used by any industry.

The representative instituted an action contesting the constitutionality of the act. The circuit court sustained the validity of the act, and on review the court affirmed the decision. The court held that the act did not deprive property owners of property without due process of law in violation of the state and federal constitutions by permitting the expenditure of public moneys for the benefit of a private corporation. Further, the bond would be issued for a proper public purpose. The court found that the act was not too vague to be implemented because it contained definite standards to determine what constituted air or water pollution which could be remedied through the issuance of bonds pursuant to the act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence indicated that defendants went to a poker club with an intent to rob the patrons. The one that fired the fatal shot claimed self-defense; however, the jury rejected that contention. The other defendant claimed that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction. The court found no error in the convictions. The court found that each defendant was armed, that the second defendant also fired his gun, and that the second defendant started the getaway car while the shooter covered the escape. Thus, the second defendant was guilty as a principal. Because defendants were charged jointly, there were not entitled to severance as a matter of right. There was no showing of legal prejudice where the defenses were not antagonistic, the jury was clearly instructed that one defendant's guilt was dependent upon whether he was present aiding and abetting. The fact that the nontestifying defendant was denied the right to the closing argument to the jury was not a basis for a separate trial. Finally, the court rejected the argument that the death sentence was cruel and unusual punishment because the penalty expressed the public policy of the state.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4-91 and 4-215 and the permits he was issued. The Commission suspended the owner's beer and wine permit and his possession and consumption permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner operated a motel, which contained a lounge. The Commission issued the lounge a beer and wine permit and a possession and consumption permit. The owner was charged with selling liquor in violation of &sect;&sect; 4-91 and 4-215 and the permits. The Commission found him guilty and suspended the permits. It allowed the owner to pay a fine in lieu of the suspension. The lower court upheld the Commission's action. On appeal, the owner argued that a gift transaction occurred, not a sale, and he challenged the constitutionality of the statutes. The court held that the owner's purported gift of liquor to his customers was merely a subterfuge. The true nature of the transaction was a sale. Consideration passed to the owner in the form of the money. South Carolina Constitution, Art. 8, &sect; 11, together with S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4-31, relative to issuing licenses, and 4-91, afforded clear warning that the owner's conduct was wrongful. The scope and extent of regulations concerning intoxicating liquor depended solely upon the judgment of the legislature. South Carolina's enactments on the subject were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission determined that the location for which the applicant sought a retail liquor license was unsuitable for the sale of alcoholic liquors for the reason that such locality was not under proper police protection. The applicant argued that the Commission's decision was arbitrary and capricious and that &sect; 4-53(2) of the Code (S.C.), which gave the Commission its authority to grant or deny liquor licenses, was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. On appeal, the court found that the Commission's decision was supported by the evidence, which included testimony of a county sheriff and a deputy sheriff that the place where the applicant intended to locate his store could not be given adequate and proper police protection. In addition, the statute declared a legislative policy and established primary standards to govern the Commission in refusing an application for a license. Accordingly, the court concluded that the delegation of the authority to pass upon and either grant or refuse applications for retail liquor licenses under &sect; 4-53(2) was no an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.</SPAN></P>

The Authority proposed to issue $ 3,500,000 in bonds to pay debt of the college incurred for purposes of, inter alia, acquiring certain equipment and trailers used as educational plant and for reimbursement of a fund of the college for capital improvements; the college was to convey its campus to the State at no cost with a leaseback and with the rent to pay the bond debt. The court held that the Act neither advanced nor inhibited religion and that it did not foster excessive governmental entanglement with religion. Significant were, inter alia, that facilities used or to be used for sectarian instruction or as places of worship were excluded under the Act, and, by the agreement between the government and the college, the properties conveyed and leased back could not be used for sectarian instruction or as a place of worship or in connection with any programs of any school of divinity.</SPAN></P>

The county denied the exemptions, and the taxpayers paid the taxes under protest. They filed suit to recover the sums paid. The trial court ruled in their favor. The court held that the trial court erred in directing the county to refund the portion of the taxes derived from a levy assessed for a school district. The taxpayers were not entitled to the exemptions. The legislature did not intend to include school district taxes under the exemption limited to county and township taxes. The failure to specifically list school district taxes showed a clear intent to exclude them from the exemption. Article 10, &sect;&sect; 5 and 6, and article 11, &sect; 6, of the South Carolina Constitution recognized counties, townships, and school districts as separate and distinct political subdivisions, and each were authorized to levy taxes for educational purposes. The taxpayers were entitled to a refund of a portion of the taxes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, a resident of the Seventh Judicial Circuit of South Carolina, filed an action alleging constitutional defects in the structure of the State's circuit court system. A lower court (South Carolina) entered an order declaring that Article V, &sect; 13 of the South Carolina Constitution required the State's judicial circuits to be substantially equal in population. Appellants, the State Attorney General and the State Treasurer, sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court also declared that present population variations among the circuits offended the equal protection clause of the State Constitution. The resident cited no particular language of Article V of the South Carolina Constitution, the judicial article, to support his contention that the framers intended to require that the circuits have substantially equal populations. He based his theory of denial of equal protection on the premise that the circuit court was the only court in each circuit to handle judicial business above the level of magistrate, excepting probate. The court found that premise false because the State Constitution's Equal Protection Clause did not confine the legislature to the circuit court system as a means for providing adequate judicial service throughout the State. The court also found that the power to correct the imbalance in judicial circuits rested exclusively in the State legislature, as provided in Article V, &sect; 13 of the State Constitution. The court reversed, also finding that the resident did not have standing to question the validity of &sect; 15-129 of the 1962 Code (South Carolina), providing for the rotation of circuit judges among the circuits.</SPAN></P>

Based upon prior acquittals in the municipal court of the offenses of speeding and making excessive noise, the driver interposed the plea of double jeopardy as a bar to the prosecution. The trial court refused to sustain the plea. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the evidence that one was speeding or making excessive noise was not sufficient to convict one for failure to stop when signaled by any law enforcement vehicle by means of a siren or flashing light. The court held that the prohibition against double jeopardy did not apply when two separate and distinct crimes were committed in the same transaction or related acts even though the crimes were so closely connected in point of time that it was impossible to separate the evidence related to them. The court found that the prosecution was not for the same act and crime for which the driver was prosecuted in the municipal court and held that the trial court was correct in refusing to sustain the driver's plea of double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate brought this class action pursuant to &sect; 10-205 of the Code of Laws of South Carolina (1962), on behalf of all persons serving sentences of six months or more on the public works of or in county prison camps. Respondents were prison and county officials. The case challenged conditions of confinement on various state and federal grounds. The trial court (South Carolina) dismissed the action and the inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted on a guilty plea to a charge of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature and to four counts of armed robbery. He was assigned to a county public works camp pursuant to &sect; 17-554 of the Code of South Carolina. This action challenged that assignment on the grounds that the statute was unconstitutional and that he was deprived of equal protection because he was deprived of rehabilitation programs available in the state penitentiary. The court disagreed and affirmed the trial court's decision dismissing the action. The court held that the labor at the county camp did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The work performed by the inmate at the county camp did not differ from work performed in the private sector. The inmate had no right to serve his sentence in the state penitentiary. The availability of educational and rehabilitation programs varied throughout the prison system, but the inmate did not have a right of access to such programs. The sentencing judge exercised his discretion in sentencing the inmate to hard labor, and it was then appropriately delegated to other officials to determine where an inmate's sentence was to be served.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty of violating &sect; 16-552.1, and applied for post-conviction relief. The lower court denied the application, and defendant appealed. The judgment was affirmed. The court held that there was no merit to defendant's contention that the sentence imposed constituted cruel and unusual punishment within the meaning of Article I, &sect; 19 of the South Carolina Constitution and the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. The charge of unconstitutionality was addressed only to the sentence, not to the statute under which the same was imposed, and the court had no jurisdiction to disturb, because of alleged excessiveness, a sentence which was within the limits prescribed by statute unless the statute itself violated the constitutional injunction, Article I, &sect; 19, against cruel and unusual punishment, or the sentence was the result of partiality, prejudice, or pressure or corrupt motive. Furthermore, the lower court did not err in failing to appoint counsel in defendant's behalf upon receipt of his application because there was no constitutional obligation to do so where there was no question of law or issues of fact requiring a hearing.</SPAN></P>

After his conviction for riot, defendant alleged that the trial judge erred in not quashing the indictment on the ground that the applicable statute was vague, erred in refusing to enter a judgment of acquittal, and erred in the admission of certain exhibits. On appeal, the court found that defendant's exceptions were without merit. The court stated that the riot statute was not unconstitutionally vague and that contention was already rejected in another action. The court determined that the record contained a sufficient amount of evidence to conclude that defendant was involved in the riot and that the trial judge did not err in refusing to grant a directed verdict in his favor. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in the admission of an order that was delivered to another rioter that directed the mob to disperse because there was evidence from which the jury could conclude that there was concert of action on the part of defendant, therefore, the order was relevant to the prosecution's case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the denial of the trial court to grant his discovery motions resulted in the denial of due process and a fair trial. The court found this argument without merit. At common law, a defendant in a criminal case had no right to pretrial discovery; thus, there was no error in the trial court ruling denying discovery. Defendant alleged error on the part of the trial court in finding that the prosecution had an open file policy in the absence of factual evidence. The record showed that the prosecution made its file available to the defense counsel before the trial court judge and, thus, the policy in other cases was irrelevant. Finally, defendant contended that the trial court committed error in failing to grant a directed verdict of not guilty on the ground that it was conclusively proved that defendant was entrapped.A jury instruction on entrapment was given and the jury found the evidence did not support the finding. The court found that there was no showing of entrapment, as a matter of law, that would support a directed verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of operating certain gambling devices. Defendant appealed the trial court's judgment. The court found that the trial court correctly allowed the jury to say whether defendant was a person who was subject to &sect; 5-621 of the 1962 Code and whether the statute covered the machine in question. The court also found that a witness was properly allowed to testify at the trial even though he did not testify at a preliminary hearing. The court concluded that the wording of &sect; 5-621 gave a man of reasonable intelligence fair notice of which machines were proscribed and that the statute could not be used in a capricious or discriminatory manner. The court held that ambiguity and doubt made an attempted revocation of defendant's prior probation ineffective and that his vague and indefinite sentence had to run concurrently with his prior sentence instead of consecutively.</SPAN></P>

The counties brought an action against the state challenging the constitutionality of the legislation on the ground that the law was vague in its description of the territorial area within which the project was to be located. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the legislation and the counties appealed. The court ruled that the fact that an act was open to the criticism that it was vague, uncertain, and indefinite in some of its provisions did not render it void so long as it did not infringe some constitutional provision and was capable of execution in its essential provisions. Further, the court held that if a legislative intent could be determined with reasonable certainty a statute was not declared inoperative. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the judgment upholding the constitutionality of the legislation, concluding that the state was empowered to carve out a district from a territory of the state for the accomplishment of some public purpose.</SPAN></P>

The husband demurred to the complaint on the ground that the action was prematurely brought in that a 1969 amendment to the South Carolina Constitution, Article XVII, &sect; 3 of the Constitution, which allowed a divorce if the parties had been separated for three continuous years, was prospective in operation and applied only to separations that continued for three years after its adoption. The trial court overruled the demurrer. In affirming, the court was not persuaded that the decree appealed from involved a retrospective application of the amendment, which dealt with a condition or state of affairs between spouses. When the bill was filed on May 7, 1970, the Constitution authorized a divorce on the ground of continuous separation for a period of at least three years, which was the very condition that existed between the parties to the bill on that date.

The court disagreed. Riot was a common law offense in South Carolina, and the definition of the crime, as adopted by the court in State v. Connolly, had been consistently followed in the South Carolina decisions. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling appellants' motion for a severance. The charges arose out of the same facts, and there was no conflict in the defenses interposed. The trial court did not err by refusing to exclude from the courtroom the defendants who had pled guilty. These defendants were participants in the riot, and the identity of those participating was one of the main questions to be decided. The presence of these defendants for the purpose of identification by witnesses was justified. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to relieve the public defender from representation of one appellant. The record attested to the competent representation of appellant by the public defender both before and after the request that he be discharged.</SPAN></P>

Five of the defendants were also convicted of possession of weapons with which to facilitate an escape. They appealed from those convictions as well.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendants argued, inter alia, that the trial court improperly refused one defendant's motion for a new trial, thereby denying that defendant his right to a fair trial. In rejecting that argument, the court held that the motion for a continuance did not show how the refusal thereof was prejudicial. The moving defendant did not point to any specific testimony or other evidence that he could have produced had his motion been granted. The court held that the defendant was entitled only to a fair trial, not a perfect one. Defendants also complained of the trial court's denial of their motion for a severance. In rejecting that argument, the court found no demonstration of probable prejudice to defendants from the trial court's failure to grant separate trials. The charges arose out of the same uncomplicated facts, and there was no conflict in the defenses interposed. Moreover, the court found it significant that the jury was able to keep the facts separate as to the participation of each of the six defendants. In affirming the convictions, the court found no merit in defendants' remaining arguments.</SPAN></P>

The inmate alleged that his conviction could not have been upheld because a scheme under which he pled guilty was unconstitutionally coercive of guilty pleas. The court held that the lower court properly determined the action. The court held that court records were not required at the time of defendant's trial and conviction. At the hearing in the lower court, the State proceeded with its side of the action and presented all of the evidence it apparently had relevant to defendant's trial. Defendant did not testify or offer witnesses. The court agreed with the lower court that the official records of the office of the clerk of court were convincing that the proper procedures were followed in the indictment, the arraignment, the calling of the action, the impaneling of the jury, and the presentation of defendant's guilty plea. The court held that defendant's plea was valid.</SPAN></P>

The trial court resolved all issues in favor of defendants. On appeal, the taxpayer asserted that &sect; 18 was unconstitutional because it undertook to exempt privately owned property from taxation. The court stated that the constitutional challenge was without merit under the fundamental principle that the power of taxation rested in the legislature subjected only to constitutionally imposed limitations. The taxpayer invoked S.C. Const. art. X, &sect; 1, which required a uniform and equal rate of assessment and taxation of all property. The court stated that that mandate expressly excepted such property as might be exempted by law for municipal purposes. Case law held that the generation and transmission of electric power by the authority was a public and governmental function for the benefit of the people of the state. Because the property was an integral part of the system through which the authority performed that public function its exemption from taxation fell within the municipal purposes exception to the equality mandate relied on by the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

The Act was a valid exercise of legislative power and the officials and corporation were to be permitted to proceed with the proposed issuance of revenue bonds pursuant to the Act. Although it was true all legislative action was to have a public rather than private purpose, where the general public interest was the dominant interest served, there was no constitutional violation, even though the aid inured to the benefit of a private corporation. No public money was involved, the state's credit was not to be adversely affected, and there was no equal protection violation where the classification was reasonable.

The circuit court (South Carolina) entered a judgment for defendants. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act authorized the university to issue bonds to finance the expansion and improvement of the university's stadium. It also provided that to insure payment on the bonds, the board was to place in effect a special student fee upon regular full-time students attending the university. Plaintiffs alleged that the Act was unconstitutional in that the fee imposed thereunder was a tax, which had to be uniformly and equally applied. They also claimed that the fee imposed under the Act was unreasonable because it required all students to pay it regardless of whether or not they used the facilities. In affirming the circuit court's judgment, the court held that under S.C. Code &sect; 22-104 (1962), the board had the authority to fix tuition fees and other charges for students attending the university. The fact that the state was relieved of the cost of the proposed improvement to the extent of the students' contributions did not mean that the students were being taxed. Moreover, under &sect; 22-104, the board had the authority for charging special student fees; there was no requirement that the fees be charged only against those using the facilities made available to the students.</SPAN></P>

It ordered that he be remanded for resentencing in accordance with S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-72, as if he had been recommended by the jury to the mercy of the court. The ruling in effect held that the petitioner's constitutional rights were infringed by the combination of S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 16-72 and S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-553.4 (1962). The State challenged the vacation of petitioner's death penalty. The court reversed that ruling. Petitioner was tried under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-72 by a jury that found him guilty. It did not recommend mercy. The statute was not unconstitutional. Since the jury did not recommend mercy, the only sentence available to the trial court, by law, was death. The trial court erred in vacating the death sentence. Petitioner sought review of four issues. The court affirmed the trial court on each.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A tractor trailer and a train collided, causing the trailer's cargo to be spilled onto the street. Defendant was called to investigate the collision.

Defendant placed the liquor in the trunk of his car. The liquor contained the appropriate labels and federal tax stamps, but not South Carolina tax stamps. Defendant stated that he believed that the bottles were a matter for the Interstate Commerce Commission, but the local police chief disagreed, believing that the bottles were a matter for him. An argument ensued, and defendant was arrested for violating the town's prohibition ordinance and resisting arrest ordinance. Defendant was convicted by a jury and sentenced. On review, that conviction was affirmed. Defendant sought review. The court determined that the prohibition ordinance was invalid and void in light of the adoption of new liquor laws and that the resisting arrest ordinance was invalid as unconstitutionally vague and an infringement of due process and free speech.</SPAN></P>

Solomon and by the federal court's judgment in the owner's federal case against appellees, the owner argued that its factual showing as to discriminatory enforcement was stronger and required a different conclusion. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly found that there was a complete failure to show the necessary &quot;element of intentional or purposeful discrimination.&quot; The court further determined that the trial court properly relied upon the holding of Solomon to dispose of the owner's other challenges to the constitutionality of the Law. The court declined to overrule Solomon. Finally, the court held that the evidence amply sustained the factual findings made by the trial court with regard to the grant of injunctive relief, and that such relief was warranted under the provisions of the Law, &sect; 64-2.4, Code of Laws (1969 Supp.) (South Carolina).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction. He alleged that the sales of merchandise for which he was convicted were procured by entrapment. Defendant alleged that &sect;&sect; 64-2 through 64-2.2, 1969 Supplement to the Code of Laws (South Carolina), were unconstitutional as violative of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the South Carolina and United States Constitutions. Defendant was the store manager. The cashier was defendant's employee. The store was open for business on Sunday under a plan whereby sales were made in violation of &sect;&sect; 64-2 through 64-2.2. The cashier was doing exactly what she was employed to do. The court thought the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction. Defendant's entrapment allegation was not raised in the lower court. The question could not have been raised on appeal for the first time. Nevertheless, the court held that there was no merit in the allegation. An officer, as a customer, simply afforded the opportunity for an illegal sale in the manner previously contrived by the management of the store. The court held that &sect;&sect; 64-2 through 64-2.2 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The attorney filed numerous motions and demurrers, which were painstakingly considered by the panel and, with certain exceptions, overruled. These included an objection to the guardian ad litem on the ground of conflict of interest, which the panel properly held to be insubstantial, and on the ground that he was mentally competent to represent himself. After extended hearings, the panel filed a unanimous report finding that the evidence established beyond any doubt the lawyer's emotional and mental instability within the meaning of rule 4(e), and recommended that he be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law. The board unanimously adopted the findings and recommendation of the panel. The court indefinitely suspended the attorney from the practice of law in the state due to the attorney's mental illness. The court concluded that the attack on rule 4(e) for unconstitutional vagueness failed. The court found that the attorney was so affected by emotional and mental instability that he was incapable of exercising necessary judgment and discretion.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the fact that property acquired with public funds would by virtue of an agreement pass to the ownership of a private corporation and that the proposed transaction involved an exchange of property between the city and the corporation did not exceed the authority of the city nor violate any public policy.

After initially pleading not guilty, the inmate changed his plea to guilty to charges of manslaughter.

The circuit court dismissed the petition, and the inmate appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that the inmate's plea was freely, voluntarily and understandingly made and that he was aware at the time of the consequences of the plea and the possible sentence which might be imposed. Even though the appellant may have been reluctant to plead guilty to manslaughter there was nothing in this record to indicate other than that his decision to do so was a result of a considered judgment based upon the advice of competent and experienced counsel, in the light of existing facts and circumstances. The inmate could not prove that he had been coerced to plead merely by alleging that his counsel advised him that he could be sentenced to death if he stood trial because his counsel had a duty to advise him of this possibility.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the injunctive proceeding, and thereafter, a condemnation proceeding was tried before a jury resulting in an award to the landowner. On review, the court affirmed both lower court judgments. The landowner asserted that the condemnation proceeding was unnecessary and the use was not a valid public use. The court agreed that lands could not be condemned for other than a public use of the property. However, the court noted that historical and recreational purposes were recognized public uses. The court held that the constitutional requirements of eminent domain were satisfied if the condemnee had reasonable notice, reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present the claim or defense, and reasonable compensation for the property taken. Whether there was a necessity, a permanent taking, or a public use were primarily legislative questions, but there was a presumption that the use contemplated was a necessary, permanent, and public one.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 15-1095 et seq. (Supp. 1969). The father argued that the trial court was without jurisdiction under S.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother filed suit against the father alleging that he was the father of her illegitimate child. The mother sought a court order requiring the father to contribute to the support of the child and to reimburse her for hospital and medical expenses connected to the child's birth. The father made a special appearance to contest the jurisdiction of the trial court to determine paternity, asserting that he had a right to a jury trial in the court of general sessions under &sect; 20-303. The trial court found that it had jurisdiction to determine paternity without a jury, and it held that the father was the father of the illegitimate child. The trial court ordered the father to support the child. The father appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that the trial court correctly asserted jurisdiction under S.C. Code &sect; 15-1095 et seq. (Supp. 1969). If the father had been charged with a criminal offense under S.C. Code &sect; 20-303, he would have been entitled to a trial by jury as provided in S.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved for a directed verdict of not guilty on the ground that the State presented no evidence that a driver's license had ever been issued to him under &sect; 46-163 of the 1962 Code of Laws (S.C.), as amended, and accordingly, that he could not be guilty of the offense charged. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The record showed that there was evidence that a beginner's permit had been issued to defendant and that the case was submitted to the jury on the theory that a beginner's permit was a &quot;privilege to drive&quot; within the purview of &sect; 46-192.1 of the 1962 Code of Laws (S.C.), as amended. The court held that the appeal was clearly without merit. No one had an absolute right to operate a motor vehicle on a public highway. The operation was a privilege that was extended to individuals under various circumstances by state statutory provisions. The court found that, when the various pertinent provisions of the law were read in conjunction, the words &quot;license to drive or privilege to do so&quot;, appearing in &sect; 46-192.1 of the Code clearly included any and all privileges under state law, including the privilege extended by a beginner's permit.</SPAN></P>

The issue was whether &sect; 47-353 of the 1962 Code of Laws was unconstitutional, conflicting with Article 8, &sect; 2, of the South Carolina Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While a majority of those voting favored incorporation, a majority of the qualified electors did not cast ballots. Article 8, &sect; 2, of the South Carolina Constitution, had to control, and it was clear, plain, and unambiguous. It required a majority of the qualified electors to consent to incorporation, but it gave the Legislature the right to prescribe how consent was to be ascertained. Respondents, who attempted to uphold the constitutionality of &sect; 47-353 of the 1962 Code of Laws, contended that all qualified voters who absented themselves from an election were presumed to assent to the expressed will of the majority of those voting. The court noted that Article 8, &sect; 2, did not require an election, but a majority of those expressing themselves favorably on the question of incorporation, if less than a majority of all qualified electors, could not require incorporation. To the extent that &sect; 47-353 of the 1962 Code of Laws permitted incorporation on the actual consent of less than a majority of the electors residing and entitled by law to vote within the proposed area of incorporation, it was unconstitutional, and the attempt to incorporate was null, void, and of no legal effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate contended that his sentence of 21 years imprisonment, which followed his plea to a charge of rape, was illegal because the plea was involuntarily entered. The penalty for rape was death unless a jury recommended mercy. However, under &sect; 17-553.4 of the Supplement to the 1962 Code of Laws, a trial court was permitted to accept a plea of guilty in lieu of a recommendation of mercy by a jury. The lower court denied the inmate's request for a writ of habeas corpus, and the court affirmed. The court found that the mere fact that the inmate's plea was taken under &sect; 17-553.4, which was subsequently declared unconstitutional, did not automatically make the plea coerced. The facts showed that the inmate's fear of the death penalty did not deter him from a trial because he claimed that he entered his plea based on counsel's statement that he would not serve any time. The court rejected the inmate's argument that his counsel was incompetent. The inmate did not charge that he was misled by any statement of the trial court. In light of his trial counsel's statements in court as to his plea, his testimony that counsel advised him differently in private conferences was not convincing.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings, which was filed by the Board and the Attorney General, and dismissed the taxpayers' action. On appeal, the court affirmed the circuit court's dismissal of the action. The court held that the bonds authorized by the Bond Act qualified as debt, under the Special Fund Doctrine, and thus, the constitutional provision, which required a vote by the electorate, was not applicable. The court noted that, under the Special Fund Doctrine, the general assembly was authorized to issue debt, without the necessity of a vote by the electorate, provided that the repayment of the indebtedness did not require the levy of a property tax.

Const. art. III, &sect; 34(IX).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state legislature amended a state statute to remove the maximum business license fee for cities with a population greater than 90,000. This had the effect of benefiting only one city in the state which then raised its business license tax in response to the amendment. Plaintiff insurance companies paid the fees under protest and sued the defendant city claiming that the statute violated the state and federal constitutions. The lower court found that the statute violated both the state and federal constitutions and defendant city appealed. The court affirmed, saying that the 1965 amendment to S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 47-407, although general in form, was special legislation in its effect in violation of S.C. Const. art III, &sect; 34(IX). That provision of the state constitution prohibits enactment of a special law where a general law could be made applicable. The court said that classifications of cities must bear a reasonable relationship to object of the legislation and that removing the cap for cities with populations over 90,000 was completely arbitrary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling that the amended statute was invalid under the state constitution as being special legislation and returned the statute to its pre-amendment state under which plaintiffs were entitled to a refund of license fees for the amount paid in excess of $ 2,500.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statutes in question set forth the punishment for murder in relation to a defendant's guilty plea. The question was whether the provisions of the statutes rendered the death penalty for murder applicable only to those defendants who asserted their rights not to plead guilty. Upon review, the court found that under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-52, a defendant who pled guilty, as well as one who pled not guilty and was found guilty by a jury, could escape the death penalty only after a jury heard the matter and recommended mercy. Thus, &sect; 16-52 was constitutional. However, under the provisions of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-533.4, a defendant could escape the death penalty by entering a guilty plea but risked the imposition of the death penalty by asserting his right to a jury trial. Thus, &sect; 17-533.4 was unconstitutional where the death penalty was involved. The court concluded that the provisions of the two statutes were severable. The court held that the choice between life imprisonment and the death penalty had to be left to a jury in each case, in accord with S.C. Code Ann. 16-52, regardless of how a defendant's guilt was determined.</SPAN></P>

A trial court (South Carolina) ruled that &sect; 11 of the Act was invalid. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act consolidated eight existing school districts in the county into a single county-wide school district, that was to be known as the county school district. That school district was to be co-extensive in area with the county and would include the eight districts. Section 11 provided that the county school district was not to assume any bonded indebtedness of the present school districts. Section 11 also stated that its provisions were not an essential inducement to the enactment of the Act. If &sect; 11 were stricken, the county would assume the bonded indebtedness of the existing districts and a uniform tax levy would be imposed throughout the county. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly ruled that &sect; 11 was invalid. S.C. Code &sect; 21-114.3 (1962) provided that upon consolidation of two or more school districts, all property and assets of the districts forming the consolidated district became the property of the consolidated district and all liabilities of the consolidating districts became the obligations of the consolidated district.

The trial court found the Act, permitting the district to impose front foot assessments against properties abutting water lines, was constitutional. The property owners appealed. The court upheld the trial court's judgment with respect to the Act. The court reasoned that the underlying purpose for the establishment of the districts was for public improvement purposes; therefore the imposition of front foot assessments against abutting properties to defray the cost of installing water lines was not unconstitutional. The court dismissed the appeal with respect to other issues raised by the property owners because there was no showing that any right of the property owners or the classes to which they belonged was adversely affected by the legislative provisions cited. The court reasoned that the property owners lacked standing to litigate the issues relating to the alleged unconstitutionality of provisions which gave the district the power to require connection by all properties to the public water system.</SPAN></P>

Relying upon the 1963 amendment, the Commission rejected the return, allowed one exemption for $ 800, and assessed a tax on the net income reported by the trustee. The trustee alleged that the amendment was unconstitutional because it allowed resident beneficiaries an $ 800 exemption while the net income for nonresident beneficiaries was allowed one $ 800 exemption regardless of the number of beneficiaries involved. The court reversed and held as follows: (1) although denominated a tax on the fiduciary, the practical operation and effect of the statute was the exaction of a tax from the beneficiary; (2) the challenged provision of the statute was to be construed as a withholding tax device, rather than as a tax on the fiduciary; and (3) nonresident beneficiaries were afforded equality of treatment under the tax statutes because they were taxed at the same rate and were allowed the same exemption, fairly prorated, as resident taxpayers.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant contended that his death sentence under &sect; 16-72 violated the prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment under Article I, &sect;&sect; 5, 19 of the Constitution of South Carolina and the Eighth and Fourteenth Amends of the Constitution of the United States when the rape victim survived. Defendant's death sentence under &sect; 16-72, Code of 1962, did not violate the South Carolina and United States Constitutions' prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment because the jury was justified in refusing to recommend mercy when the offense was of great atrocity and the record was barren of mitigating circumstances. Section 16-72 lawfully expressed the public policy of the State, and the wisdom of the policy was a legislative question, not a judicial one.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board investigated the optician's office and notified the optician it intended to suspend his license, and the optician appealed. The Board found that the optician was guilty of seven alleged violations in the way he operated. The optician filed a writ of certiorari to the common pleas court, and the court found that the optician had violated a discount advertising prohibition, allowed a non-licensed person to participate in the business, and violated Board Rule C, which prohibited operation under another name, and not as a sole owner. Both parties appealed. The court affirmed the common pleas court determinations except as to the rule. No bias by the Board was proved. The statutory provisions were proper exercises by the legislature of its license and police powers, but the Board could not adopt a substantive rule for suspension of a license for other than the statutory reasons contained in S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 56-1077. The court remanded the case to the Board for reconsideration of the penalty since the maximum suspension was based on the determination that the optician had violated all seven of the Board's charges and the courts had invalidated five.</SPAN></P>

On the Act's effective date and before, the merchants sold one or more brands of milk for less than what they charged for other brands. The court held that the merchants were real parties in interest because the merchant's transactions were with their distributors, not with the latters' producers; transactions between the merchants and their distributors imposed no restrictions on the right, manner, or price to customers; title passed from the distributors to the merchants by the express terms of sales and invoices accompanying them; the merchants alone had to bear a loss resulting from destruction of, or damage to, the milk occurring after delivery to them; title passed to a purchaser subject to revesting in the seller in the event of returned goods; and ownership of the right sought to be enforced qualified the merchants as real parties in interest. The issue was the right to sell milk at whatever price the merchants chose. The merchants' interest in the validity or invalidity of the Act qualified them as real parties in interest under &sect; 10-207 of the 1962 Code.

The liquor was purchased from licensed retail liquor dealers. Law enforcement officers raided the clubroom, confiscated 47 bottles of alcoholic liquors, and preferred criminal charges against the bartender for violation of &sect;&sect; 4-91, 4-95, and 4-96. The club filed an action to restrain enforcement of the statutes on the grounds that they were inapplicable to its activities and were unconstitutional. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the club, and defendants appealed. The court reversed, holding that the club contended that it was a private club and, as such, could sell liquor to its members and guests without a license if the liquor was legally acquired, but the statutes contained no such exception. It was undisputed that the club had in its possession alcoholic liquors solely for the purpose of sale and was selling such liquors to its members and guests without a license from the State to do so.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court had declared the apportionment of the South Carolina Senate under Article III, &sect; 6, unconstitutional, and approved as an interim measure a plan of reapportionment increasing the number of members of the Senate from 46 to 50. The court applied the rule that a statute could be constitutional in part but unconstitutional in another part, and if the invalid part was severable from the valid, the latter could stand while the former was declared void. The rule was applicable to a section of a state constitution, which was partially invalid because of conflict with the Federal Constitution. One of the basic functions of a state constitution was to provide for the composition of the legislature, including the number and apportionment of members of the two branches. Article III, &sect; 6, remained an effective and valid part of the Constitution for the purpose of determining the size of the Senate.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the trial judge erred in holding that appellant restaurant, merely because it operated a billiard or pocket billiard table described in &sect; 5-655, was a &quot;billiard room&quot; within the meaning of &sect;&sect; 5-501 et seq.; thus, the statutory regulations applicable to billiard and pocket billiard rooms in &sect;&sect; 5-501(6) and 5-513 were inapplicable to the restaurant and similarly-situated businesses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission determined that expansion of the existing sewer system, which served only 25 percent of residents, was necessary for public health. It proposed to extend sewer lines to serve nearly all residents. To pay for the expansions the Commission proposed to issue bonds and raise revenue through a district wide ad valorem tax, a service charge against all properties using the sewer system, and an assessment per foot, payable over a 10-year period, against properties abutting the collection laterals. Corner properties were to be assessed on the longer side only. The property owners brought an action arguing that the imposition of frontage assessments was arbitrary and unconstitutional. The trial court found in favor of respondents, and the property owners appealed. The court held that the General Assembly had authority to authorize the Commission to impose frontage assessments and an ad valorem tax. The Commission's method of distributing the burden of the improvements was more equitable than a district-wide assessment. There was no merit in the contention that the owner of a vacant lot should not be subjected to the frontage assessment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not err in allowing the original indictment against defendants to go to the jury. Defendant A testified about his prior guilty plea. Defendants consented that the original indictment should be sent to the jury under appropriate instructions. A solicitor's comment did not place his reputation for veracity against that of defendant A.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, freeholders and taxpayers, sought an injunction to prevent defendants, the county board of education and the county auditor and treasurer, from issuing bonds for school purposes authorized under Act No. 581 of the Acts of the General Assembly of South Carolina for 1965. The trial court (South Carolina) granted defendants' demurrer and the taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the taxpayers' complaint was subject to demurrer. The taxpayers argued that the constitutional amendment under which the Act No. 581 was passed was unconstitutional. Amendment of Article X, &sect; 5, Ratified February 10, 1956 permitted the county to incur indebtedness for school purposes in an amount not exceeding fifteen percent of the assessed value of all taxable property in the count and excluded that indebtedness from the aggregate debt limitation imposed by &sect; 5. The taxpayers contended the language of the proposed amendment, which had appeared on a ballot submitted to taxpayers, was not the same as that passed by the legislature. The court found that the wording of the amendment on the ballot was sufficient to describe the amendment fairly to voters. The court also found it was a reasonable assumption to believe voters read the ballot and it was more important that statement of the issue to be voted, not that posted in the polling places, be clear to voters. No irregularities in the election warranted invalidation of the legislation nor did a resulting uneven apportionment of taxes among communities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Criminal, Juvenile, and Domestic Relations Court of York County, South Carolina, entered a judgment on a verdict finding defendant guilty on a charge of having uttered a fraudulent check in violation of &sect; 8-176 of the 1962 Code of Laws of South Carolina. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the seller had a custom of dealing wherein defendant would give the seller a check on a Friday as a promise to pay for liquor, which defendant then illegally sold over the weekend. On the following Monday, defendant would give the seller cash from the sale of the liquor, and the seller would return the check to defendant. On one occasion the seller deposited the check, which a bank refused to pay due to insufficient funds. Defendant was charged, arrested, and tried for having uttered a fraudulent check. The only witness who testified was the seller. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, the judgment was reversed. The evidence, as stated above, proved that the check in question was a mere promise to pay, rather than a check within the purview of &sect; 8-176, so the presumption of fraud that arose from &sect; 8-177 of the 1962 Code of Laws of South Carolina was inapplicable. Without the presumption of fraud, the testimony of the seller did not constitute substantial evidence that reasonably tended to prove defendant's guilt, or that allowed fair and logical deduction that defendant was guilty. Thus, a directed verdict of acquittal should have been rendered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff resident appealed an order of the circuit court (South Carolina), which granted judgment in favor of defendant city in an action for an injunction to prevent the fluoridation of the city water supply. The resident contended that the fluoridation unduly infringed upon his upon individual liberty under S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 5 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and that it violated his equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the state board of health filed a rule regulating the addition of fluoride to public water supplies, the city held a public hearing and concluded that its water supply should be fluoridated. The resident filed an action for an injunction to prevent the city from fluoridating the water supply. The resident contended that fluoridation was not beneficial and was in fact harmful to his arthritic condition. The trial court granted judgment in favor of the city. The resident appealed and contended that fluoridation unduly infringed upon his individual liberty under S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 5 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and that it violated his equal protection rights. The court affirmed and held that the entire weight of authority in the country was against the resident, as it had been shown that after years of research and study, fluoridation of water supplies was of tremendous health benefits to the public. The court found that the U.S. Supreme Court had repeatedly denied certiorari in such fluoride cases for lack of a substantial federal question. The court held that the state and city had proper police powers to protect the public health, and such action was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
