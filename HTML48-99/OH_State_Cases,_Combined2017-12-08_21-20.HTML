</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Relator, the People of the State of Ohio on behalf of a voter, filed a petition with the court praying for a writ of mandamus to issue to respondents, the members of a county board of elections, ordering them to take such steps as were necessary to enable them to provide an adequate number of voting compartments for the voters in the county. The board demurred to the petition, claiming that it did not state a valid cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reviewed applicable statutory law pertaining to elections in order to render its judgment. It addressed the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3501.29, 3507.06, and 3507.14 and found that there was no repugnancy or conflict between any of the election-related provisions. The court found that &sect; 3506.14 did not place discretion in the board to determine the number of voting machines to be used in each precinct, independently of the duties enjoined by &sect;&sect; 3501.29 and 3507.06. The board was required to determine the number of machines to be used in each precinct by applying the standard set forth in &sect; 3501.29, which provided for one voting machine for every 100 qualified electors and, on the basis of that ration, to determine the number of machines necessary to accommodate the number of qualified electors in each precinct. The court further found that the legislature intended to apply the same standard respecting voting machines as it prescribed for paper ballots. The court held that the board could use its machines on hand, along with the paper ballots, or provide the use of both in any of the precincts in order to provide adequate means for voting in county elections.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Respondents, the directors of the Union County agricultural society, sought review of a judgment entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Union County (Ohio), which found that Amended House Bill No. 164, as enacted by the 101st General Assembly of Ohio, was unconstitutional. The trial court had overruled the directors' demurrer to relator taxpayers' petition challenging that provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The 101st General Assembly enacted Amended House Bill No. 164, which provided for the election of a board of directors for the Union County agricultural society. After an election, the taxpayers challenged the constitutionality of that legislation. The trial court overruled the directors' demurrer and entered a judgment finding the legislation unconstitutional after they failed to otherwise plead. The directors appealed from that decision, which was affirmed. Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26 required the uniform operation throughout the state of all laws of a general nature. In that regard, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 1711 set forth the requirements for membership in county agricultural societies and the method by which their directors were chosen. Moreover, such societies existed in almost every Ohio county. Furthermore, the constitutionality of an act was determined by the nature of its subject matter, as opposed to its form. While the method of selecting the directors of county agricultural societies may have been nonrepresentative, that fact did not warrant legislation that was applicable to a single county. Therefore, Amended House Bill No. 164 violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant, a decedent's natural son, sought review of the judgment of the Probate Court of Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which held that the son was not an heir of the decedent because he had been adopted by another and could not inherit from the decedent. Appellee estate administrator was also a party to the action to determine the decedent's heirs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The administrator commenced an action to determine the heirs of the decedent, who died intestate. The son claimed to be the sole heir at law, notwithstanding the fact that he had been legally adopted by his adoptive father during his childhood. The probate court held that the son was not an heir. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 8030, which provided that an adopted child could inherit from its natural parents, did not apply even though it was in effect at the time of the adoption. Instead, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3107.13, under which the son could not inherit from the decedent because he was adopted, applied because it was in effect at the time of the decedent's death. The court rejected the son's contention that &sect; 3107.13 did not apply to children who had been adopted prior to the effective date of &sect; 3107.13. Section 3107.13 was meant to apply to all adopted children, regardless of the time of their adoption. Applying &sect; 3107.13 was not an improper retrospective application because it did not change or affect existing rights of the son as to inheritance where there were no rights of inheritance until the death of the decedent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff car dealer appealed the decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County (Ohio), which entered a judgment in favor of defendants, members of the Motor Vehicle Dealers' and Salesmen's Licensing Board, the Director of the Department of Highways, and the Ohio Attorney General (state agencies). The car dealer sought a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1317.08.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The car dealer challenged the constitutionality of the Ohio Installment Sales Act (Act), Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1317, which did not permit a car dealer to retain any part of the sale price as a finance charge. Car dealers routinely sold installment sales contracts to financing companies at a discount because the car dealers could not afford to sell cars and finance the sale. In ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the trial court found in favor of defendants. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court. Initially, the court determined that the trial court had jurisdiction over the action and that defendants were proper parties to the proceeding. As to the substantive issue, the court held that the Ohio legislature had the right to regulate installment sales and set percentage rates in installment sales and financing agreements as part of it police power to protect consumers. Because the Act was reasonably related to the object sought to be accomplished and had a real or substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, and to the general welfare, the Act was validly enacted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff concrete company appealed from the judgment of the trial court (Ohio) that was entered in favor defendants, a city and its officials, and which dissolved a temporary restraining order in an action for injunctive relief alleging that Reading, Ohio, City Ordinance No. 918-1954, which imposed weight restrictions on certain traffic, violated the equal protection provisions of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The ordinance was passed as an emergency measure due to damage that had been caused to city streets as the result of vehicles weighing more than 20,000 pounds. The company's trucks weighed more than that, and when its employees were arrested for violation of the ordinance, it sued to enjoin its enforcement. The company argued that the ordinance was discriminatory because it regulated only through traffic, allowing overweight vehicles if the transportation had a beginning or ending point in the city. A judgment was entered against the company. It appealed, but because it failed to file an appeal bond, only questions of law were considered. In reversing, the court ruled that, although a municipality had the police power to regulate streets and highways, and keep them in repair, equal protection required that any classifications be reasonable. The ordinance's restriction on traffic passing through the city, while allowing local overweight traffic, was a purely arbitrary classification, and therefore it was invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment was reversed, final judgment was entered for the company, and the cause was remanded for execution of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Relator employers brought an original action in mandamus on their own behalf and on behalf of all employers of labor amenable to the Ohio Workmen's Compensation Act, public as well as private. The employers attacked the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4123.341, 4123.342, pursuant to which additional contributions were exacted from public and private employers for defraying administrative costs of respondent Ohio Industrial Commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employers contended that premiums or collections were only authorized for the purpose of providing and paying compensation to workmen or their dependents for injuries, death, or occupational diseases occasioned in the course of employment and that collections for the commission's administrative expenses were not authorized. The employers sought an order requiring the commission to refund all monies collected in excess of the legal rates of premium that were determined according to the constitution. The court found that Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 35 empowered the legislature to enact laws establishing a workmen's compensation fund. A fundamental axiom of constitutional law was that an express grant of power impliedly included incidental powers necessary and proper for carrying into execution the express power. Therefore, in the absence of constitutional limitations, the legislature had the discretion to provide for the payment of the commission's administrative expenses by levying a contribution upon the employers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff automobile operator sought review of a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Huron County (Ohio), which was entered upon the jury's verdict in favor of defendant railroad company in an action to recover personal injuries resulting from a collision between a train operated by the railroad and the automobile. The collision occurred upon the tracks of the railroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">At trial, there was conflicting testimony as to whether flashing devices were signaling or whether the warning whistle or bell was sounding as the operator approached and drove the vehicle upon the tracks. On review, the operator assigned error to the common pleas court's decision to strike a certain ordinance from the petition. The court disagreed, noting that there was evidence that the ordinance was an unreasonable exercise of the police power. However, the court then found that when the jury instructions relating to contributory negligence were considered together with the general charge of the court on the subject, undue emphasis was accorded the defense of contributory negligence, which was to the prejudice of the operator. Moreover, the general charge improperly charged that the operator had an absolute duty as a matter law to see the approaching train and avoid a collusion. It had been for the jury to determine whether the operator was guilty of contributory negligence in failing to exercise ordinary care in operating the automobile upon the tracks of the railway under the circumstances as they were shown to exist at that time. The court accordingly reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the amending ordinance, which reclassified the property in question for industrial uses, was a valid exercise of legislative authority. The court held that the rezoning at issue was on a debatable matter, was not arbitrarily done, and was a valid exercise of the police power vested in the city. Finally, the court held that the trial judge was correct in holding that the rezoning at issue did not constitute a spot zoning in the generally accepted meaning of that term.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The nonprofit corporation applied for a permit to build a synagogue on its land, which was subject to certain residential zoning restrictions. The application was denied by the city building and planning commission and the denial was sustained by the zoning board of appeals. The nonprofit corporation sought a writ of mandamus from the court to order the city officials to issue the permit, claiming that the city officials' action in denying the permit was arbitrary and unreasonable and violative of the nonprofit corporation's constitutional rights. The court granted the writ to the nonprofit corporation and ordered the city officials to issue the permit for the erection of the synagogue. The court ruled that the zoning restrictions prohibiting construction of the synagogue bore no substantial relation to the public health, safety, or welfare of the community and was thus unconstitutional. The court concluded that the city officials' refusal to issue a special permit to the nonprofit corporation for congregational purposes, pursuant to the zoning restrictions of the ordinance was an abuse of discretion and also a violation of the nonprofit corporation's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">One defendant, a conservancy district, appealed on questions of law and fact from a judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Franklin County (Ohio). Plaintiff railroad brought its action on its own behalf and on behalf of all owners of real property in Franklin County, which sought to enjoin the collection of a levy of three-tenths of a mill on the assessed valuation of property within the conservancy district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The railroad filed a petition that sought to enjoin the collection of a levy on the assessed valuation of property within the conservancy district. The trial court enjoined the collection of the tax and ordered defendants, a county treasurer and auditor, not to take action to collect the levies. In spite of the injunction, 70,000 county residents voluntarily paid the tax, and the railroad paid its tax under protest. None of the taxpayers brought an action for recovery within one year pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2723.01. The railroad sought to recover the taxes paid by it and the county residents. The conservancy district filed a counter-petition that sought to recover the taxes paid. The trial court made the injunction permanent and did not order payment of the taxes. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The tax was illegal, but the court found that the failure of the taxpayers to file an action for recovery waived their right to injunctive relief because they voluntarily paid the illegal tax and had not used the only effective method of recovery. The taxes held by the treasurer were held by him as agent for the conservancy district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court remanded the case to the trial court for an order that dissolved the injunctive relief previously granted and an order that the treasurer held the voluntarily paid property taxes as an agent for the conservancy district.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was nothing per se unreasonable in the provisions of the ordinance. Further, the court ruled that since the ordinance was valid the owner had conducted a sale with out a license and rendered himself liable to its penal provisions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The residents brought an action against the city to enjoin the city from collecting charges from the users and payers of water rent for the use of a nonexisting sanitary sewage system and sanitary sewage disposal plant. They also asked that the city be enjoined from discontinuing the water supply to the inhabitants of the city for failure to pay such rents and charges. Judgment was entered in favor of the residents. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. The court determined that the city could not adopt an ordinance fixing rates and charges to be paid and then take no further steps in the completion of the proposed improvement for an indefinite time. The court held that, as a result, the city did not have the authority to compel the payment of such rates and charges for services the residents would not receive within the foreseeable future. The court stated that the petition stated a good cause of action for injunctive relief because of the unreasonable delay of the city to take appropriate steps towards the completion of the proposed improvement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the judge's motion to strike, finding the petition to be frivolous. The attorneys appealed. On appeal, the court held that the trial court was without jurisdiction to control the future acts of the trial judge, that the issues presented for declaratory judgment did not set forth any legal controversy or the violation or threat of violation of any legal right, nor would a declaration terminate a controversy or remove any uncertainty, and that the petition failed to set forth a cause of action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The parties were married in 1943. The wife commenced an action in the New York court for separation from bed and board from the husband. The husband left New York in 1945 before the court's award of alimony was served on him. In 1952 the wife obtained a judgment in the same New York court for alimony past due and owing. The wife then filed a lawsuit in the trial court to enforce the New York judgment against the husband who possessed certain property in Ohio. The trial court ruled that the New York judgment could be enforced against the husband. The husband sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the service of process in the wife's New York lawsuit to enforce the award of alimony past due and owing on the husband's New York attorney in the original action was valid. The court found that the husband's attorney-client relationship had never formally been severed even though seven years had lapsed. The court held that the New York court proceeding in 1952 was merely a continuation of the prior action and the trial court properly granted the wife's application to enforce the collection of the alimony past due and owing.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance was passed as an emergency measure by the City council and apparently contained no definitions of the terms &quot;residential&quot; and &quot;business.&quot; The oil company filed a petition for writ of mandamus alleging that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court held that the ordinance, which provided that no business should be located within the designated residential zone except upon the approval of the planning commission, was unconstitutional.

The court also found that the fact that texts and maps of each proposed zoning change were available for inspection was advertised in a newspaper of general circulation, and that a total of three public hearings were held on each proposed change before the board voted to amend the zoning ordinance. The court held that such procedure constituted substantial compliance with the statutory requirements and cured any defect in the procedure related to the availability of texts and maps for examination. The court also held that the board had discretionary power as to the manner in which amendments to the original zoning ordinance could be amended, and that it did not abuse that discretion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The motion to dismiss was based upon defendants' contention that the court did not have jurisdiction to grant a declaratory judgment in the first instance. Defendants argued that the court only had appellate jurisdiction in a declaratory action. The court agreed with the argument of defendants. The court determined that original jurisdiction was conferred to it by Ohio Const. art. VI, &sect; 6 (1945) and that its jurisdiction was further defined by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2501.02. The court reasoned that the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.02, was a remedial act and did not change any substantive rights of the parties or enlarge the jurisdiction of the court over subject matter and parties. The court observed that an action for a declaratory judgment was not included in Ohio Const. art. VI, &sect; 6 (1945), which prescribed the original jurisdiction of the court in quo warranto, mandamus, habeas corpus, prohibition and procedendo. The court concluded that it had no jurisdiction to entertain an original action filed in the court for a declaratory judgment because such jurisdiction was not conferred either by the constitution or by statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The parties were involved in a pending divorce action. The wife filed a motion seeking payment of certain expenses of suit. The common pleas court ordered the husband to pay the wife $ 400 toward the wife's attorney fees as temporary alimony. The husband apparently failed to pay the amount and was found in contempt of court by the common pleas court. The common pleas court ordered that the husband be imprisoned for 10 days and fined $ 200 whereupon the husband appealed the common pleas court's temporary alimony order. After the husband filed his appeal, the wife filed a motion seeking an order requiring the husband to pay a reasonable amount for expenses of suit related to making a defense to the appeal. The court held that an order finding the husband guilty of contempt for failing to pay temporary alimony was reviewable on questions of law. The court also rejected a claim that it had the inherent power to award the wife reasonable expenses of suit for the appeal. The court held that it had no jurisdiction under Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 6 to grant the wife's requested relief. The court therefore denied the wife's motion without reaching the merits of the husband's appeal.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the provision as to the classification of directors was general in character but the provision prohibiting the attempt to restrict cumulative voting by code regulation was specific.

The truck driver appealed from the decision contending that the city ordinance was unconstitutional because it was an unreasonable and arbitrary exercise of police power contrary to Ohio Const. art.

The court found that the garage-base was located in a factory-zoned district and the ordinance unreasonably deprived the factory of the use of the property without due process of law, and deprived the factory of the right to use the public streets and highways in a reasonable manner. The court stated that if the ordinance provided some other reasonable outlet for ingress and egress to the garage-base, then there would not be an unreasonable and arbitrary exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

The court held that an order refusing bail or requiring reduction of excessive bail pending trial on the merits was interlocutory in character and could not be reviewed upon appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The remonstrators contended that the board's action could not take effect because a majority of the qualified electors residing in the territory, who had voted in the last general election of 1953, had remonstrated within 30 days against it. The board contended that the &quot;last general election&quot; within the meaning of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3311.26 was the election of 1952. As the 1953 election had not taken place before the board's action, the court adhered to its ruling that the 1952 election was last general election. No deduction for the deaths or removals of voters was permitted. The court found that the board did not abuse its discretion in reaching the conclusion that a majority of the qualified electors in the 1952 election had not remonstrated. The court also rejected the remonstrators' contention that a published notice of the board's action did not comply with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3311.27. While the notice did not reproduce verbatim the resolution, it contained the resolution's substance. The remonstrators failed to meet their burden of proof that the board's action was unreasonable and arbitrary or that it, to their prejudice, failed to follow the law.</SPAN></P>

The court further noted that the constitutionality of &sect; 13453-1 was supported by Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 9 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2949.02, 2953.10.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was arraigned on an indictment charging her with murder in the second degree. After the jury's guilty verdict, defendant's bail bond was continued in effect. The court determined that there was no such thing as absolute, fixed, and determinate punishment for life where one had been convicted of murder in the second degree, but that imprisonment was only until legally released. The court found that in dealing with the problem of crime, the state had abandoned fixed determinate punishment in favor of the humane principle of correction and return to society in all cases except treason and murder in the first degree. The court ruled that the suspension of execution and admission to bail rested in sound judicial discretion in the light of all the facts presented and the administration of justice, a strong consideration being that an accused should not suffer the penalty for crime until by the due processes of law it was determined that he had a fair trial free from prejudicial error. Allowing the application, the court held that in the exercise of its discretion, defendant was entitled to suspension of execution and admission to bail.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants were charged with contempt for refusing to respond to certain questions, after having been duly sworn as witnesses before a duly constituted session of the Commission.

I, &sect; 10, and the U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV. The court concluded that the act that created the Commission was constitutional because it did not invaded a field of government in which the United States had paramount authority under the U.S. Constitution. The court found that the adjournment of the General Assembly had no effect upon the power of the Commission. The court reviewed each count to determine whether defendants had invoked their privilege from answering, the Commission still required an answer, defendants, knowing that an answer was required, had refused to answer, and the answer would not have incriminated them. The court held that on some counts that trial court erred in finding some defendants guilty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer was an attorney who practiced law in the city, and he filed an action on behalf of himself and others similarly situated alleging that the city's earned income tax ordinance was unconstitutional based on equal protection grounds. The taxpayer asserted that the ordinance created two classes of taxpayers and that the classification was unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious, and discriminatory. The trial court ruled in favor of the taxpayer, and the court reversed. The court held that the difference in the treatment of the taxpayers who derived income from different sources was not pro se prohibited discrimination, and the classes were not so similar that they had to be treated precisely the same way. The ordinance's method of determining net profits was fair and practical, and it showed no intent to discriminate. The distinction between wages and net profits was a valid basis of classification and did not constitute unconstitutional discrimination. Thus, the ordinance was enforceable, and the trial court's judgment enjoining collection of the tax was unwarranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee, the Ohio State Racing Commission, sought an order consolidating appeals from the decision of a common pleas court (Ohio), which adjudged that certain rules adopted and amended by the Commission had been done so according to law and that they were reasonable and lawful. The Commission also requested that appellants' appeals be dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Commission submitted two reasons why the appeals should be dismissed. First, the Commission argued that the Administrative Procedure Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.11, did not authorize an appeal from an adverse decision rendered by the common pleas court upon a duly perfected appeal questioning the validity of rules adopted by the commission. Second, the Commission contended that even assuming that &sect; 119.11 did authorize an appeal, the statute was unconstitutional because it extended the court's appellate jurisdiction to nonjudicial matters. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.12 provided for appeals from adjudicative orders of boards and commissions to the courts. The court further found that an appeal authorized under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.11 was not unconstitutional because the common pleas court passed upon the legality and reasonableness of the rules adopted by the racing commission. The court held that these types of actions by the common pleas court were recognized as judicial functions. The functions authorized by &sect; 119.11 on review were judicial actions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant challenged a judgment of conviction of the crime of being found in a state of intoxication within the city in violation of Cleveland, Ohio, Municipal Code &sect; 13.1516, entered upon a finding by the trial court (Ohio) without the intervention of a jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, defendant contended that he had to be guilty of the crime in a public place in order to be found guilty. Defendant was arrested in his home. The police officers went to defendant's home to investigate a traffic accident. The court noted upon examining the history of the legislation dealing with intoxication that for more than 100 years it was the law of the State of Ohio that any one &quot;found&quot; in a state of intoxication was guilty of a misdemeanor. The place where defendant was found in a state of intoxication was of no importance. The court held that the plain language of &sect; 13.1516 clearly provided the intention of the legislature. The plain words of the ordinance, &quot;any person, who was found in a state of intoxication,&quot; did not indicate that, when such unlawful act, as thus defined, was committed in the home of defendant, such conduct was not to come within the prohibition. Here the harm provided against was being found in a state of intoxication. One who, by the use of intoxicating liquor, destroyed his reason and self-control, and who thereby became a potential danger to himself and those about him, came clearly within &sect; 13.1516.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants, the Division of Wildlife, Department of Natural Resources, and its predecessor executive and administrative officers, appealed a declaratory judgment of a common pleas court (Ohio) in favor of plaintiff and cross-petitioners, commercial fishermen, that construed Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 1427, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1533.45. An appeal on questions of law and fact was dismissed and the appeal was retained for determination on questions of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The issue was whether the phrase &quot;any net whatever&quot; as prohibited in Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 1427 included a seine, a weighted net. The fishermen had invested money in seines which could not profitably be operated, laid out, or pulled from the shores without laying them within prohibited areas. The court said there was sufficient ambiguity in &sect; 1427 for the admission of evidence to ascertain whether it was the intent of &sect; 1427 to prohibit the use of seines. After reviewing the statutory history and from an analysis of several other sections of the act, it was apparent that in certain instances the term &quot;net whatever&quot; was intended to include &quot;seine&quot; and that in several instances a seine was excepted from the term &quot;net;&quot; but, nevertheless, there was sufficient ambiguity to receive evidence relating to the intention of the legislature. For 38 years, no effort was made by the officers in charge of the enforcement of the provisions of &sect; 1427 to prohibit the use of seines in the prescribed area. The prayer for injunctive relief was merely incidental to obtaining a declaratory judgment and full and complete relief was afforded by the entry of the declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment was modified by the elimination of all provisions therein for an injunction and, as so modified, the judgment was affirmed. The temporary injunction issued by the court was dissolved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Relator son filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel defendant state hospital superintendent to admit the son's mentally incompetent father. A county probate court had found the father to be mentally ill and a danger to the community and ordered his involuntary commitment to the hospital pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5123.23. The superintendent filed a demurrer that challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 5123.23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The son filed the action after the superintendent refused to obey the commitment order. The superintendent demurred to the application and asserted that &sect; 5123.23 was void and violated the Fourteenth Amendment and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 2; art. II, &sect; 26; and art. IV, &sect;&sect; 1, 7. The court noted that the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5123.23 had been challenged previously. In one case, an Ohio appeals court had upheld the constitutionality of the statute and that opinion was affirmed by the Ohio Supreme Court because six votes were not available to declare the law unconstitutional as required by Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 2. In a different case from a different appeals court, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5123.23 was found to be unconstitutional, and that decision was upheld by only five members of the Ohio Supreme Court, which was allowed to uphold an appellate court's finding of unconstitutionality by fewer than six votes under Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 2. Given the ambiguity of the precedent, the court held that it was not bound by any precedent, could decide the constitutionality issue, and found the statute void. It nevertheless ordered that a writ could issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was cited for having violated the noise ordnance of the city. He was operating his vehicle on the streets of the city until he was stopped because his vehicle had a dual exhaust system that amplified the sound caused by his vehicle's exhaust. The standard equipment had been removed. At trial, the officers testified that the vehicle made a loud and excessive noise, which annoyed and disturbed them. Further, the officers testified that the noise would have annoyed others on the street. Following defendant's conviction, he appealed. On review, defendant asserted that the ordinance was void for vagueness in violation of the Due Process Clause. The court disagreed, finding instead that the operating of sound-amplifying devices conflicted with people's quiet enjoyment of their homes and property and with safe and legitimate uses of the city streets. Therefore, the court concluded that the sound was constitutionally subject to regulation or prohibition by the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owners operated a bar in which they sold prophylactics by means of a coin-operated vending machine located in a restroom on their premises. Defendants sought to issue a citation to the owners based on the allegation that the sale of the prophylactics constituted a failure to maintain decency and good order on the owners' premises. The owners then filed a petition to permanently enjoin the Board and the Department from issuing the citation. The trial court sustained defendants' demurrer, dissolved a temporary injunction, and dismissed the owners' petition. On appeal, The court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the Board was expressly granted the power promulgate rules, regulations, and orders for the conduct of any retail business authorized under permits issued pursuant to the Ohio Liquor Control Act. The court found that under the Act the owners were entitled to a hearing to present evidence in support of their contention. The court concluded that the Act provided the owners an adequate remedy at law and that the owners, because they had failed to exhaust their remedies, were not entitled to the injunction sought.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged with selling a condom, a violation of the Ordinance. The trial court sustained defendant's demurrer to the indictment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected defendant's contention that the Ordinance on its face was unconstitutional. Although Toledo, Ohio, Ordinance 17-10-8, &sect; 2 provided that the Ordinance did not affect regular practitioners of medicine or druggists in their legitimate business, there was no evidence that the classification was unreasonable. The court also held that the complaint, upon its face, stated a valid cause of action under the Ordinance. It charged defendant with selling, offering for sale, and exhibiting an article known as a condom intended for the prevention of conception, and the Ordinance prohibited the selling, offering for sale, or exhibiting an article or thing intended for the prevention of conception. The Ordinance also did not violate the Conflict Clause of the Ohio Constitution. However, the court determined that proof of intent was necessary to make out the offense charged, yet the city failed to allege in the affidavit such intent as required by Ohio Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed from the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Paulding County (Ohio) committing him to a state mental hospital for observation and examination under Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 13451-20, following a jury verdict finding him guilty of an attempt to commit rape of a female under the age of 16 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">An indictment alleged that defendant raped or ravished a 13-year-old girl. The jury found him not guilty of rape, but guilty of attempt to commit rape as therein charged. That offense was one of the classes of offenses listed in &sect; 13451-20, which required a mental health examination before sentencing. Accordingly, a commitment order was issued, while defendant's motions for arrest of judgment and for a new trial were denied. Defendant appealed, claiming the evidence was insufficient and his commitment was contrary to due process. In affirming, the court ruled that the commitment order conformed to &sect; 13451-20 and, that statute being a reasonable and humane one to provide for treatment of mentally ill persons, rather than penal servitude, it did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Also, on a charge of rape under Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 12414, a jury was authorized to find an accused guilty of attempted rape under Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 12415, pursuant to Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 13448-2. Lack of consent by the complaining witness was not an essential element of an offense under Ohio Gen. Code &sect;&sect; 12414 or 12415, and it was not necessary to allege or prove lack of consent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The commitment order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed from a judgment entered by the Police Court of the City of Cleveland Heights, Ohio, which found him guilty of opening his hardware store on a Sunday, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3773.24.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, defendant asserted that his hardware business was operated as a &quot;necessity&quot; under the savings clause of &sect; 3773.24, which prohibited Sunday business activities other than those of necessity and charity. Defendant further asserted that &sect; 3773.24 was unconstitutional and that his equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2 were violated. The court rejected defendant's contentions. The State made out a prima facie violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3773.24, and defendant failed to establish that his business activities constituted a &quot;necessity&quot; by the greater weight of the evidence. The statute was not unconstitutional because such laws fell within the police power of the states. Furthermore, the fact that defendant was prosecuted while other business owners were not did not amount to an equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff sought review of an order from a common pleas court (Ohio), which refused to permit him to withdraw his oral motion to dismiss his case without prejudice. The action had been one for personal injuries claimed to have suffered by plaintiff in an automobile accident because of the negligence of defendant administratrix's decedent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Among plaintiff's assignments of error was his contention that the administratrix had waived the right to invoke the benefit of Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 10509-112, which addressed the time period by which plaintiff had to file his claim, by answering and going to trial without asserting the failure of the creditor to conform to the statute. On review, the court initially noted that as the action had been dismissed on plaintiff's own motion without prejudice, it could not be said that the refusal of the trial court upon its interpretation of &sect; 10509-112 to reinstate the case would preclude the instituting of a new action by him. The court then held that contrary to plaintiff's contention, the great weight of authority was that the administratrix could not waive the nonclaim statute of limitations under which claims had to be presented. Moreover, the statute was constitutional, despite plaintiff's assertions to the contrary. Accordingly, the trial court acted correctly in refusing to allow plaintiff to withdraw his motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Montgomery County, Division of Domestic Relations (Ohio), which convicted him of violating Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 1639-45. The charge was that defendant did act in a way tending to cause the delinquency of three minor children under the age of 18 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant contended that &sect; 1639-45 was unconstitutional. The court determined that the statute had uniform operation throughout the state and did not violate Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26 for lack of uniformity. The fact that some courts in the state gave the statute a strict construction and that other courts gave it a liberal construction or were harsh or lenient in its application did not render the statute void for lack of uniformity. The court found that the language of Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 1639-45 had to be necessarily general in its terms; many different acts of an individual might tend to cause delinquency in a child. The court affirmed and concluded that the statute was not void for uncertainty because it described the offense with reasonable certainty. The mere fact that a penal statute was so framed as to require a jury upon occasion to determine a question of reasonableness did not make it too vague to afford a practical guide to permissible conduct. The test was whether the language conveyed sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Municipal Court of Toledo (Ohio) that found him guilty of violating Toledo, Ohio, Traffic Code &sect; 21-6-8, which prohibited the reckless operation of vehicles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The complaining witness and defendant resided in adjoining properties. The complaining witness parked her vehicle on the street in front of defendant's premises. Later in the same day, defendant parked his motor vehicle in front of his own property and in doing so pushed complainant's motor vehicle forward to provide adequate space. No violent force was directed against the vehicle of complainant and no damage inflicted. It may be inferred from the evidence that the front bumper of defendant's vehicle came in contact with the rear bumper of complainant's vehicle. Defendant was found guilty of reckless operation of a vehicle. On appeal, defendant argued that ordinance was unconstitutional. The court held that if there was another error assigned upon which it could satisfactorily dispose of the case and rest its judgment, the alleged unconstitutionality of the act was regarded as immaterial. Further, no person was endangered in his life or limb and no property damaged. There was no evidence of any violent or uncontrolled contact with complainant's motor vehicle. The charge laid in the affidavit was wholly unsupported by the evidence, and no violation of the ordinance was shown.</SPAN></P>

Appellees, a Board of Education of Roundhead Local School District and a local parent and teacher organization, were the opposing parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants argued that the trial court improperly exercised its jurisdiction in hearing the appeal. It also contended that Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 154-46e was constitutional. The court found that the trial court properly had jurisdiction of the appeal. Appellants acted as a licensing agency when it granted, and later revoked, the high school charter. Such adjudications were appealable to a trial court under Ohio. Gen. Code &sect; 154-73. However, the court agreed with the trial court and it found that Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 154-46e was unconstitutional. The court affirmed. The statute purported to give appellants arbitrary authority to exercise in their uncontrolled discretion. There were no statutory provisions for determining the method of chartering high schools. The statute was an improper delegation of legislative power. Law-making was a sovereign power that was only conferred upon the legislative branch of the government. The statute did not come within the exception to the general rule, which allowed administrative regulations to be established for police regulation for the public safety and general welfare.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In two cases consolidated for review, appellant club challenged orders of the Common Pleas Court of Mahoning County (Ohio) entering judgments for appellee housing authority, finding that the Ohio Housing Law was valid and constitutional, that the authority had the power to appropriate land owned by the club for low-income housing, and granting a limited injunction that allowed possession after the land was rezoned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In the appropriations' case, the trial court found that the authority complied with all the provisions of the Ohio Housing Authority Law, Ohio Gen. Code &sect;&sect; 1078-29 to 1078-50, and that it had the right to appropriate the land. The land in question was vacant land. The club argued that the trial court erred in finding that the authority had the right to appropriate the land and to allow the assessment for compensation to be made. The club contended that the authority lacked the power of eminent domain and to appropriate land for low-income housing. The court disagreed and affirmed. Although the trial court erred in allowing the club to protest the right to appropriate in the appropriation action, the club was not barred from the election of remedies' doctrine from prosecuting the injunction action. Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 1078-34a gave a housing authority special powers of appropriations over property within its territorial limits. The authority was not required to establish a public purpose as a condition precedent to exercising the right of eminent domain. The statute was constitutional. There was evidence that the authority reasonably exercised its authority of eminent domain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The ward had several life insurance policies and before he was adjudged incompetent he changed the provisions so that his wife, who later became his guardian, would receive a lump sum payment with the balance paid out over a period of 10 years. After the ward was adjudged incompetent, the guardian petitioned the probate court to change the provisions of the policy so that she would receive a lump sum payment of the entire proceeds of the policies upon the death of the ward. The guardian asserted that the ward's estate was exhausted and she would have to pay the premiums from her own funds. The probate court denied the insurer's demurrer and ordered that the policy be changed. On appeal, the court found that the guardian had no right or power to maintain an action against her ward for relief which was solely for her own personal benefit. The court found that the probate court did not have jurisdiction over the action because its jurisdiction was limited to the management of the ward's estate and the relief sought by the guardian had nothing to do with the management of the ward's estate.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment that the ordinance in question was void and enjoined its enforcement. From that judgment, the city took this appeal. The court found the trial court erred in finding the legislation was a proprietary function, as the legislation lay in the field of the police power. However, even though it was a reasonable regulation under the police power, the ordinance still needed to be constitutional. The ordinance was not constitutional because no policy was established or standards fixed for the guidance of the solicitations advisory board and the city commission. The ordinance operated as a censorship of the society, was a denial of liberty without due process of law, and was a denial of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

Further, the court held that the parents were exempt from service in a civil action until a reasonable time passed in which to leave the jurisdiction after the conclusion of the trial. The court also held that the law by clear language conferred jurisdiction upon the juvenile court.

As such, defendant argued that he should not have been convicted because there was no proof that he had knowledge of the fact that he had possession of undersized fish. The court agreed, reversed the convictions, and discharged defendant. The court opined that when the statute defined an offense regardless of scienter and where the means of knowledge were available to the accused, knowledge was not an essential element to support conviction but that when the charge of violating a statute was not in terms of scienter and the means of knowledge were not at hand or the circumstances were such that the accused was not bound to know that his action was criminal, knowledge of the fact was essential to support a conviction. The court reasoned that in this instance it could not have been assumed that the legislature intended to denounce as criminal the possession of small fish by a person such as defendant who did not have knowledge of the undersize or the means of acquiring such knowledge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant insurance company appealed from a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County (Ohio) awarding plaintiff wife all right, title, and interest owned and possessed by defendant husband in certain insurance policies and granting full and complete control and ownership thereof, together with all rights under the policies in a divorce action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff filed for divorce. Defendant husband was not personally served with a summons, nor did he enter his appearance. Constructive service was obtained. At the time plaintiff filed her action she had in her possession two separate policies of insurance between defendant husband and defendant insurance company. Plaintiff filed a supplemental petition stating that she was continuing to pay the premiums thereon. Plaintiff also asked to be awarded all the right, title, and interest owned and possessed by defendant husband in and to the polices. Defendant insurance company appealed from the judgment that awarded plaintiff both policies. The fact that plaintiff, the beneficiary, had the policies in her possession did not enlarge her rights therein. No right became vested in plaintiff until the death of the insured. Plaintiff had the right to keep the policies in force by continuing payment of the premiums, so that she may benefit from any rights that may become due at a future date under the policy terms or by a decree of a court having proper jurisdiction. But, such benefits did not come upon terms subsequently imposed by a court, where the insured was not before the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the part of the decree that substituted plaintiff for defendant husband in the contracts of insurance between defendant husband and defendant insurance company because plaintiff could only benefit from the contract as agreed upon between the insurer and the insured and not upon terms subsequently imposed by the court, where defendant husband was not before the court either by personal service or by his voluntary appearance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The business purchased 100 acres of land located within the village. After the purchase, the business commenced operations for the striping and removal of loam and topsoil for commercial purposes. The village effectuated an amendment to an existing ordinance which, in essence, required the business to obtain a permit for its operations, to provide detailed information on its business plan, and to post a bond. The business challenged the amendment on constitutional grounds. The trial court denied the business relief. On review, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. In reaching its decision, the court concluded that the village's amendment to the ordinance in question was a valid and constitutional exercise of police power, that the ordinance bore a reasonable relation to the health, safety, convenience, prosperity, and welfare of the village, and that a decree should accordingly be entered in favor of the village.</SPAN></P>

In reversing the trial court, the court found that the trial court improperly took on a legislative role in that its review of the village's ordinance should have been limited to determining whether its enactment was unconstitutional. The court found that the ordinance was a proper exercise of the village's police powers and concluded that the trial court was without jurisdiction to determine that the area in question would be classified as an industrial use.</SPAN></P>

The licensee contended that Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 6064-3a, upon which the Board based its authority to promulgate the minimum price regulations, was unconstitutional and void because it delegated legislative authority to the Board without establishing a standard by which the authority might be exercised. The licensee also asserted that the Board's price regulation was invalid because it was arbitrary and unreasonable. The court on appeal affirmed the trial court's judgment based on the presumption in favor of the validity and the constitutionality of &sect; 6064-3a and the disputed Board regulation drafted pursuant to that section, and giving weight to the broad power granted by the legislature to regulate traffic in intoxicating beverages. The court also held that by providing that the Board could determine minimum prices, that was tantamount to the legislature declaring that there should be minimum prices for the sale of wine.</SPAN></P>

The agents of the electors asserted that the incorporation proceedings had priority over the annexation proceedings. The court affirmed both judgments and held as follows: (1) even if the residents were vested by Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 3532 with the right to maintain the action, the amended petition failed to state a cause of action because the facts pleaded did not present an occasion for the exercise of judicial power; (2) the agencies at issue in the petition were not exceeding the authority given them under the Ohio Constitution and the statutes; (3) the agents' petition was fatally defective because the allegation that the annexation proceedings were commenced prior to the incorporation proceedings had not been adjudicated; and (4) the petition presented a case of a clash between two agencies of the state without furnishing any basis for deciding which had the prior right to proceed.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that there was no competent evidence adduced to support the finding of the referee as affirmed by the Board. The decision of the referee was unlawful, unreasonable, and against the manifest weight of the evidence, and no prejudicial error was committed by trial court in reversing the decisions of the referee and the Board. The court also found that the record disclosed a denial of due process due to the failure of the referee to comply with Ohio Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The biological mother gave birth to the child about three months after her first husband divorced her. Eight months later she married her second husband, who claimed to be the father of the child. About one month later, appellees, the biological mother and her second husband, signed a permanent surrender of the child. Two months later, the agency placed the child in appellants' home and five months later their petition to adopt was filed. The court held that appellees' surrender was revocable and had been revoked because a withdrawal of consent to adopt could be made at any time prior to the actual order of adoption. Although appellants had a significantly greater income than appellees, the court found that there had been no showing that appellees were unfit and that the adoption, consequently, had not been shown to be in the child's best interest. Because the next friend's report was not offered in evidence, there was no demand for its production in the probate court, and it was not a part of the record in the probate court, the court concluded that it had no authority to order it made a part of the record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;I BELIEVE THE JUDGMENT OF THE TRIAL COURT SHOULD BE REVERSED AND THE CAUSE REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO OVERRULE THE DEMURRERS AND FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS ACCORDING TO LAW.  COURT UPON RECOMMENDATION OF THE COUNTY BOARD OF REVIEW BY ENTRY DATE FEBRUARY 18, 1949, FORFEITED SAID LOT TO THE STATE OF OHIO FOR NON-PAYMENT OF REAL ESTATE TAXES WHICH FORFEITURE WAS WITHIN THE TWO-YEAR PERIOD PRESCRIBED BY 5718 GC.  THE PETITION FURTHER ALLEGES THAT THE DEFENDANT, NICHOLAS DARASH, BY DEED DATED MAY 4, 1949, BECAME THE PURCHASER OF SAID LOT AT THE COUNTY AUDITOR'S FORFEITED LAND SALE AND THAT SINCE THAT TIME HE HAS CLAIMED TITLE ADVERSE TO THE PLAINTIFF AND REFUSES TO RELINQUISH POSSESSION.  THE PLAINTIFF'S PRAYER ASKED THE COURT TO DECLARE THE RESPECTIVE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES TO PARCELS I AND II AND ASKS THAT ITS TITLE BE DECLARED TO BE SUPERIOR TO THAT OF THE DEFENDANT, NICHOLAS DARASH.  THE PETITION WAS FILED MARCH&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  27, 1951.  DEFENDANTS, THE COUNTY AUDITOR AND DARASH, FILED SEPARATE DEMURRERS TO THE PLAINTIFF'S PETITION.  THE DEMURRER OF THE COUNTY AUDITOR WAS GROUNDED ON THE CLAIM THAT THE ACTION WAS NOT BROUGHT WITHIN THE LIMIT OF TIME PROVIDED BY 5762-1 GC.  THE DEMURRER OF THE DEFENDANT, DARASH, WHILE NOT CLEARLY SETTING FORTH THE GROUNDS RELIED UPON, BY ITS BRIEF INDICATES THAT HE CLAIMS THAT THE ACTION IS BARRED BY THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND SECOND, THAT THE ALLEGATIONS OF THE PETITION UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO STATE A CAUSE OF ACTION.  THE COURT SUSTAINED BOTH DEMURRERS AND ENTERED JUDGMENT FOR THE DEFENDANTS AND BY ITS APPEAL, THE PLAINTIFF CLAIMS THE FOLLOWING ERRORS: &quot;1. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN SUSTAINING THE DEFENDANT'S DEMURRERS ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE ACTION WAS NOT BROUGHT WITHIN THE TIME SPECIFIED FOR BRINGING SUCH ACTIONS &quot;2. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN SUSTAINING THE DEMURRER OF DEFENDANT NICHOLAS DARASH ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE ACTION WAS A COLLATERAL ATTACK ON THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS &quot;3. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN SUSTAINING THE DEMURRER OF APPELLEE DARASH ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS DID NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OF THE CAUSE&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  OF ACTION &quot;4. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN SUSTAINING THE DEMURRER OF APPELLEE DARASH ON THE THEORY THAT THE PETITION FAILED TO STATE A CAUSE OF ACTION.  &quot; SO FAR AS PARCEL NO. 2 IS CONCERNED, BY THE ALLEGATIONS OF THE PETITION, THE TAXES BECAME DELINQUENT IN 1932, SUCH DELINQUENCY WAS PROPERLY PUBLISHED AND ALL SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURAL STEPS LOOKING TO FORFEITURE AND SALE OF FORFEITED LANDS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PARCEL FOLLOWED WITHOUT DEVIATION THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE APPLICABLE STATUTES.  SO AS TO PARCEL NO.  2, NO CASE IS STATED IN THE PETITION.  AS TO PARCEL NO. 1, WHICH IS THE REAR END OF THE LOT (PARCEL NO. III), THE PLAINTIFF FAILED TO PAY THE TAXES DUE AFTER 1945 AND IT WAS THEN CERTIFIED DELINQUENT BY THE COUNTY AUDITOR IN 1947.  PART SECOND: TITLE I. TAXATION CHAPTERS 14 AND 15, 5704 TO 5773 GC, PROVIDE THE MANNER IN WHICH PUBLIC AUTHORITIES SHALL PROCEED TO CORRECT DELINQUENT REAL ESTATE TAXES.  SEC. 5704 GC IN PART PROVIDES: &quot;IMMEDIATELY AFTER EACH AUGUST SETTLEMENT, THE COUNTY AUDITOR SHALL MAKE AND CERTIFY A LIST OF DUPLICATE THEREOF OF ALL THE DELINQUENT LANDS IN HIS COUNTY.  &quot; *** THE SECTION FURTHER PROVIDES THAT, WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS HERE NOT IMPORTANT, IT SHALL BE HIS&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  MANDATORY DUTY TO CAUSE A LIST OF THE DELIQUENT LANDS TO BE PUBLISHED, AFTER A &quot;DISPLAY NOTICE&quot; HAS FIRST BEEN PUBLISHED.  ACCORDING TO THE ALLEGATIONS OF PLAINTIFF'S PETITION, PARCEL NO. 3 (WHICH WAS PARCELS NO. 1 AND 2 COMBINED) WAS CERTIFIED DELIQUENT IN JULY, 1947, BUT NO PUBLICATION AS PROVIDED BY 5704 GC WAS MADE.  SEC. 5718 GC PROVIDES IN SUBSTANCE THAT AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF TWO YEARS THE COUNTY AUDITOR SHALL MAKE A DUPLICATE CERTIFICATE OF EACH DELINQUENT TRACT OF LAND UPON WHICH THE TAXES, ASSESSMENTS, PENALTIES AND INTEREST HAVE NOT BEEN PAID SHOWING THE AMOUNT DUE AND STATING THERE &quot;THAT THE SAME HAS BEEN CERTIFIED TO THE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY AS DELIQUENT.  &quot; TWO METHODS ARE PROVIDED FOR DEALING WITH REAL ESTATE UPON WHICH THE TAXES HAVE BECOME DELINQUENT, THAT IS FIRST BY FORECLOSURE AND SECOND BY FORFEITING SUCH LANDS TO THE STATE AND A SUBSEQUENT AUDITOR'S SALE THEREOF.  SEC. 5718-1 GC IN SUBSTANCE PROVIDES THAT BEFORE DELINQUENT LANDS ARE CERTIFIED TO THE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY AS PROVIDED IN 5718 GC THE COUNTY BOARD OF REVISION SHALL EXAMINE THE LIST OF DELIQUENT LANDS AND IF, IN THEIR JUDGMENT, CERTAIN PARCELS THEREOF WILL NOT BRING ENOUGH AT FORECLOSURE TO PAY THE&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  TOTAL TAX CHARGED AGAINST IT AND THE COSTS OF FORECLOSURE, THEN SUCH BOARD SHALL CAUSE SUCH LAND TO BE OMITTED FOR FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS.  SEC. 5718-1A GC PROVIDES THAT A LIST OF OMITTED LANDS SHALL BE MADE BY THE AUDITOR AND FILED WITH PROSECUTING ATTORNEY WHO SHALL FILE AN APPLICATION IN THE COMMON PLEAS COURT SETTING FORTH THE ACTION OF THE BOARD AND PRAYING FOR AN ORDER FIXING A DATE FOR A HEARING OF OBJECTIONS TO THE ACTION OF THE BOARD AND UPON HEARING TO SEEK AN ORDER CONFIRMING THE ACTION OF THE BOARD AS TO OMITTED LANDS AND FORFEITING SUCH LANDS TO THE STATE OF OHIO.  SEC. 5718-1B GC PROVIDES FOR THE PUBLISHING OF NOTICE AT THE TIME SUCH APPLICATION WILL BE HEARD AND IN WHICH THE NAMES OF THE OWNERS SHALL BE SET FORTH AS PROVIDED BY 5704 GC, THE FORM OF THE NOTICE AND THE NUMBER OF PUBLICATION BEING SET FORTH IN THE STATUTE.  SEC. 5718-1C GC PROVIDES FOR THE HEARING OF SUCH APPLICATION BY THE COURT FOR THE PURPOSE OF HEARING ANY WRITTEN &quot;LEGAL OBJECTIONS&quot; FILED WITH THE COURT OR ORAL &quot;LEGAL OBJECTIONS&quot; PRESENTED BY PERSONS ATTENDING THE PROCEEDING AND *** &quot;IF IT APPEARS THAT SUCH PROCEEDINGS WERE REGULAR AND IN CONFORMITY WITH LAW, THE COURT SHALL SO FIND AND SUCH FINDING&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  SHALL NOT BE COLLATERALLY ATTACKED.  THE COURT SHALL THEREUPON CONFIRM THE ACTION OF THE BOARD OF REVISION AND SHALL ORDER SUCH LANDS FORFEITED TO THE STATE OF OHIO.  SUCH LANDS SHALL THEREUPON BE FORFEITED TO THE STATE OF OHIO AND DISPOSED OF AS PROVIDED BY CHAPTER 15 OF THIS TITLE.  &quot; *** THIS SECTION ALSO PROVIDES THAT THE TERM &quot;LEGAL OBJECTION&quot; AS USED ABOVE SHALL INCLUDE: &quot;THAT THE LISTS PROVIDED FOR IN 5704 AND 5718-18 GC, HAVE NOT BEEN PUBLISHED ACCORDING TO LAW.  &quot; THIS SECTION ALSO PROVIDES FOR AN APPEAL FROM THE ORDER OF FORFEITURE AS IN ALL OTHER CIVIL ACTIONS.  THE PLAINTIFF'S PETITION AS ABOVE SET FORTH ALLEGES THAT UPON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE COUNTY BOARD OF REVIEW THE COMMON PLEAS COURT OF CUYAHOGA COUNTY ORDERED PARCEL III FORFEITED TO THE STATE OF OHIO FOR NON-PAYMENT OF REAL ESTATE TAXES.  SUCH AN ALLEGATION INCLUDES BY NECESSARY IMPLICATION THAT SUCH ORDER WAS MADE BY A COURT THAT HAD ACQUIRED JURISDICTION OF THE PROCEEDING AS PROVIDED BY 5718, 5718-1, 5718-1A, 5718-1B AND 5818-1C GC, AND THAT THE COURT IN MAKING THE ORDER MUST HAVE FOUND ALL PROCEDURAL STEPS HAD BEEN TAKEN AS PROVIDED BY LAW.  THE ORDER OF FORFEITURE CONSTITUTED A JUDGMENT OF THE COURT.  SUCH&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  JUDGMENT CAN NOT BE COLLATERALLY ATTACKED.  (SEC. 5818-1C GC.  ) THE DEFENDANT'S DEMURRER ADMITS ALL ALLEGATIONS OF THE PETITION WELL PLEADED.  THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE TRUTH OF CONTRADICTORY ALLEGATIONS ARE ADMITTED.  THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT ORDERING FORFEITURE OF THE LAND WHEN CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF THE FACTS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT SUCH JUDGMENT AS PROVIDED BY STATUTE IS IN DIRECT CONTRADITION OF THE ALLEGATION THAT THE CERTIFICATE OF DELINQUENCY WAS NOT PUBLISHED AS PROVIDED BY 5704 GC.  IF THE LEGAL EFFECT OF OMITTING THE FIRST PUBLICATION UNDER 5704 GC, WAS TO VOID ALL SUBSEQUENT STEPS IN DEALING WITH DELINQUENT LANDS, THEN THESE TWO ALLEGATIONS OF FACT CAN NOT BE RECONCILED.  THE COURT COULD NOT FIND, UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, THAT THE PROCEEDINGS WERE REGULAR ( 57181C GC) AND IN CONFORMITY WITH LAW.  THE JUDGMENT WHICH CAN NOT BE COLLATERALLY ATTACKED MUST, THEREFORE, STAND AS THE PLAINTIFF'S CLAIM AND THE ALLEGATION OF THE FAILURE TO PUBLISH A LIST OF THE DELINQUENT LANDS AFTER CERTIFICATION CAN NOT BE CONSIDERED AS ADMITTED BY DEFENDANT'S DEMURRER.  THIS BEING TRUE, PLAINTIFF'S PETITION DOES NOT STATE A CAUSE OF ACTION.  IN THE CASE OF LEWIS AUDITOR V. TAYLOR, 18 O. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C. C. 443, THIS PRINCIPLE OF LAW WAS CLEARLY DETERMINED.  THE ACTION WAS TO ENJOIN THE COLLECTION OF CERTAIN ASSESSMENTS PUT AGAINST THE PLAINTIFF'S PROPERTY, THE PROCEEDS TO BE USED FOR CERTAIN IMPROVEMENTS.  THE PETITION ALLEGED THAT THE ASSESSMENTS WERE MADE UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF AN ACT OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF OHIO WHICH, IT WAS ALLEGED, WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  THE ANSWER ALLEGED KNOWLEDGE THAT THE IMPROVEMENTS WERE TO BE MADE AND ASSESSMENTS WERE TO BE MADE AGAINST PLAINTIFF'S PROPERTY AS PROVIDED BY THE ACT AND IF THE ACT WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL THE PLAINTIFFS HAD KNOWLEDGE THEREOF.  THE SUPREME COURT HAD PREVIOUSLY HELD AN ACT SIMILAR TO THE ONE IN QUESTION TO BE CONSTITUTIONAL.  A DEMURRER WAS FILED TO THE ANSWER AND THE QUESTION OF WHAT ALLEGATIONS OF FACT IN THE ANSWER WERE ADMITTED BY THE DEMURRER WAS PRESENTED.  THE COURT SAID ON PAGE 446: &quot; WE MAY SAY HERE BEFORE WE GO TO THE DISCUSSION OF THE MERITS OF THE QUESTION ARGUED BY COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFFS IN ERROR ON THE QUESTION OF ESTOPPEL, THAT THE CLAIM IS MADE BROADLY HERE THAT UP UNTIL THE DECISION OF THE SUPREME COURT IN HIXSON V. BURSON, UNDER THE PRIOR DECISION OF THE SUPREME COURT IN THE HIBBS CASE, 35 OH ST, 458, THAT&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THIS ACT AND SIMILAR ACTS WERE CONSTITUTIONAL UNDER THE DECISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE.  NOW, HOW IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A PARTY, WHETHER A LAWYER OR NOT, TO KNOW THAT AN ACT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL WHEN THE SUPREME COURT HAS HELD THAT A SIMILAR ACT, ONE EXACTLY LIKE IT, IS CONSTITUTIONAL, IS A MATTER THAT THIS COURT IS NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE.  PROBABLY IT IS ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS WHICH JUDGE SHAUCK SAYS CAN ONLY BE ANSWERED BY A COURT OF LAST RESORT.  56 OH ST, 396. &quot;WE THINK THAT THE ALLEGATION OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF AN ACT WHICH THE SUPREME COURT HAS HELD TO BE CONSTITUTIONAL IS NOT AN ALLEGATION OF FACT, AND IS NOT ADMITTED BY DEMURRER.  &quot; *** COMING NOW TO THE CLAIMED ERROR IN SUSTAINING THE DEMURRER BECAUSE THE ACTION WAS NOT BROUGHT WITHIN THE LIMIT OF TIME PROVIDED BY 5762-1 GC.  THIS SECTION PROVIDES: &quot; IN ALL CASES WHEREIN REAL PROPERTY IN THIS STATE IS OR HAS BEEN SOLD UNDER AND BY VIRTUE OF THE PROVISIONS OF CHAPTER 14 OR 15 OF THIS TITLE, NO ACTION SHALL BE COMMENCED, NOR SHALL ANY DEFENSE BE SET UP TO QUESTION THE VALIDITY OF THE TITLE OF THE PURCHASERS AT SUCH SALE FOR ANY IRREGULARITY, INFORMALITY OR OMISSION IN THE PROCEEDINGS RELATIVE TO THE&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  FORECLOSURE, FORFEITURE OR SALE, UNLESS SUCH ACTION BE COMMENCED OR DEFENSE SET UP WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE DEED TO SUCH PROPERTY IS FILED FOR RECORD OR ONE YEAR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS ACT, WHICHEVER IS LONGER.  &quot; IT IS THE CLAIM OF THE PLAINTIFF THAT THIS SECTION HAS NO APPLICATION BECAUSE ALL OF THE PROCEEDINGS SUBSEQUENT TO THE CERTIFICATION OF DELINQUENCY OF PARCEL 3 IN 1947 ARE VOID FOR THE ALLEGED FAILURE TO PUBLISH NOTICE OF THE CERTIFICATE OF DELINQUENCY OF SAID LOT AS PROVIDED BY 5704 GC.  THIS SECTION PROVIDES IN PART THAT &quot;IT SHALL BE MANDATORY UPON THE COUNTY AUDITOR TO CAUSE A LIST OF THE LANDS ON SUCH DELINQUENT LAND LIST AND DUPLICATE TO BE PUBLISHED&quot; AS THEREIN PROVIDED.  ASSUMING FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS DISCUSSION THAT THE ALLEGATION IN PLAINTIFF'S PETITION THAT THE AUDITOR FAILED TO PUBLISH PLAINTIFF'S LOT DESIGNATED AS PARCEL NO. 3 AS CERTIFIED DELINQUENT IS ADMITTED BY DEFENDANT'S DEMURRER, DOES SUCH FAILURE DESTROY THE VALIDITY OF ALL SUBSEQUENT PROCEEDING EVEN THOUGH ALL SUCCEEDING STATUTORY PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN LITERALLY FOLLOWED? THE FIRST STEP TO SUBJECT PROPERTY TO THE PAYMENT OF UNPAID TAXES ASSESSED AGAINST IT IS PROVIDED BY 5704 GC REQUIRING&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THE AUDITOR AFTER EACH AUGUST SETTLEMENT TO CERTIFY IN DUPLICATE THE LIST OF LANDS UPON WHICH THE OWNERS, OR THOSE RESPONSIBLE THEREFORE, FAILED TO PAY HIS TAXES.  SUCH DUTY BEING ENJOINED BY LAW, EVERY OWNER IS CONCLUSIVELY PRESUMED TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LEGAL STEPS THAT WILL FOLLOW THE FAILURE TO MEET HIS TAX OBLIGATIONS.  A PUBLICATION OF NOTICE OF THE LIST IS NOT NECESSARY FOR HIS INFORMATION.  HIS OWN FAILURE TO ACT CREATED THE DELINQUENCY.  IF THERE IS ANY PURPOSE TO BE SERVED BY REQUIRING A PUBLICATION OF SUCH LIST, IT MUST BE FOR THE INFORMATION OF THE PUBLIC AND NOT THE PROPERTY OWNER.  THE CERTIFICATION OF THE DELINQUENT LIST OR ITS PUBLICATION HAS NO DIRECT EFFECT ON THE OWNER'S TITLE THAT HAD NOT BEEN CREATED BY DEFAULTING IN THE PAYMENT OF TAXES.  AFTER PROPERTY HAS BECOME DELIQUENT, ONE OF TWO METHODS IS PROVIDED FOR TO ENFORCE THE TAX LIEN, THAT IS EITHER BY FORECLOSURE OR BY CAUSING THE LAND TO BE FORFEITED TO THE STATE AND THEN SOLD IN A FORFEITED LAND SALE BY THE AUDITOR.  THE COUNTY BOARD OF REVIEW IS CHARGED WITH DETERMINING WHICH METHOD WILL BE USED AS TO EACH PROPERTY CERTIFIED DELINQUENT.  IF THE BOARD DETERMINES THAT UPON FORECLOSURE THE PROPERTY WILL NOT&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  SELL FOR AN AMOUNT SUFFICIENT TO PAY THE TAXES AND COSTS OF FORECLOSURE, IT IS AUTHORIZED TO OMIT SUCH LANDS FROM THE LIST CERTIFIED TO THE COUNTY PROSECUTOR FOR FORECLOSURE AND THE COURT PROSECUTOR IS REQUIRED TO PRESENT SUCH LIST IN A PROCEEDING IN THE COMMON PLEAS COURT SEEKING AN ORDER OR JUDGMENT FORFEITING SUCH LANDS TO THE STATE.  NOTICE OF THE TIME AND PLACE OF THE HEARING AND THE NAMES OF THE OWNERS OF THE PROPERTY MUST BE PUBLISHED AS REQUIRED BY 5704 GC.  THE COURT ACQUIRES JURISDICTION IN THE PROCEEDING FILED IN COURT BY THE PROSECUTOR BY VIRTUE OF SUCH PUBLICATION OF NOTICE.  THE COURT HAVING ACQUIRED JURISDICTION, ITS JUDGMENT BECOMES FINAL UNLESS APPEAL IS TAKEN.  THE STATUTES PROVIDE THAT AFTER JUDGMENT OF FORFEITURE, THE AUDITOR CAN NOT DISPOSE OF THE PROPERTY WITHOUT ANOTHER PUBLICATION OF THE LIST OF FORFEITED LANDS TO BE SOLD, THE NAMES OF THE OWNERS, THE TIME AND PLACE OF THE SALE AND THE AMOUNT OF THE DELINQUENCY.  IF FORECLOSURE IS THE METHOD USED TO ENFORCE THE TAX LIEN AGAINST THE PROPERTY ON THE DELINQUENT LAND LIST, IT IS PROVIDED BY 5718-3 GC THAT THE ACTION SHALL PROCEED THE SAME AS AN ACTION TO FORECLOSE THE LIEN OF A MORTGAGE REQUIRING EITHER PERSONAL&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  SERVICE OR CONSTRUCTIVE SERVICE.  IT IS THEREFORE, EVIDENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE DID NOT INTEND THE FIRST PUBLICATION OF THE DELINQUENT LAND LIST AT THE TIME THE LAND WAS CERTIFIED DELINQUENT AS JURISDICTIONAL.  FAILURE TO MAKE SUCH PUBLICATION EVEN THOUGH DESIGNATED AS &quot;MANDATORY&quot; DOES NOT INVOLVE THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSES OF EITHER THE STATE OR FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.  THE PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THE PLAINTIFF TO HIS LAND CAN NOT BE DISTURBED UNTIL NOTICE IS SUBSEQUENTLY GIVEN EITHER IN AN ACTION TO ORDER A FORFEITURE OF TO INSTITUTE A FORECLOSURE PROCEEDING.  THE SUPREME COURT IN THE CASE OF MILLER V. THE LAKEWOOD HOUSING CO., 125 OH ST 152 IN CONSIDERING THE EFFECT OF FAILURE TO PUBLISH THE LIST OF PROPERTY CERTIFIED DELINQUENT UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF 5704 GC BEFORE IT WAS AMENDED AUGUST 11, 1943, TO PROVIDE THAT PUBLICATION OF THE LIST SHOULD BE MANDATORY, HELD BY PARAGRAPH 3 OF THE SYLLABUS: &quot;UNDER THE FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS ON DELINQUENT LANDS PRESCRIBED BY THE PRESENT CODE, THE PUBLICATION BY A COUNTY AUDITOR OF THE LIST OF DELINQUENT LANDS IN HIS COUNTY, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF 5704 GC, IS NOT MANDATORY.  &quot; AND THE COURT SAID ON PAGE 161 &quot;WHETHER A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  IS MANDATORY OR DIRECTORY DEPENDS ON ITS EFFECT.  IF NO SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS DEPEND ON IT AND NO INJURY CAN RESULT FROM IGNORING IT, AND THE PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATURE CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED IN A MANNER OTHER THAN THAT PRESCRIBED AND SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME RESULTS OBTAINED, THEN THE STATE WILL GENERALLY BE REGARDED AS DIRECTORY; BUT, IF NOT, IT WILL BE MANDATORY.  THIS IS THE RULE USUALLY FOLLOWED IN THIS STATE IN DECIDING WHETHER STATUTORY PROVISIONS CONSTITUTE CONDITIONS PRECEDENT WHOSE OMISSION INVALIDATES FURTHER ACTION UNDER THE STATUTE IN QUESTION.  &quot; THE PROCEDURE FOR DEALING WITH DELINQUENT LANDS EXCEPT FOR THE AMENDMENT TO 5704 GC AND THE PROVISION FOR FORFEITING LANDS TO THE STATE WHEN FORECLOSURE IS IMPRACTICAL IS NOW THE SAME IN PRINCIPLE AS WHEN THE FOREGOING CASE WAS DECIDED.  AND, ON PAGE 163 OF THE OPINION THE COURT SAID: &quot;UNDER THE NEW STATUTE, THE OLD TAX SALE IS ABOLISHED AND REGULAR FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS, FORBIDDEN TO BE BEGUN UNTIL TAXES ARE DELINQUENT FOUR YEARS, ARE PROVIDED IN LIEU THEREOF, WITH MARSHALING OF LIENS AND DUE PROCESS BY PERSONAL SERVICE UPON THE LANDOWNER.  SECS. 5717 AND 5718 GC.  AS THE STATUTE NOW STANDS, NO RIGHT OF THE TAXPAYER IS PREJUDICED&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BY THE FAILURE OF THE OFFICER TO PUBLISH THE LIST AND NOTICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH 5704 GC, BECAUSE NOT THE TAXPAYER RECEIVES AMPLE JEOPARDIZED BY THE SALE, BUT THEY ARE NO LONGER NECESSARY FOR THE PROTECTION OF THOSE RIGHTS.  &quot; WE MUST CONCLUDE, THEREFORE, THAT PROCEEDINGS SUBSEQUENT TO THE ALLEGED FAILURE TO PUBLISH THE CERTIFICATE OF DELINQUENCY WERE NOT VOID.  THE OMISSION, IF IN FACT THERE WAS SUCH, SHOULD HAVE BEEN PRESENTED UPON THE HEARING OF THE APPLICATION TO FORFEIT SUCH LANDS.  WE MUST FURTHER CONCLUDE THAT BECAUSE THIS ACTION WAS FILED MORE THAN ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF THE SALE, THE PROVISIONS OF 5762-1, SUPRA, GC, APPLY AND THE DEMURRERS OF BOTH DEFENDANTS MUST BE SUSTAINED BECAUSE IT WAS NOT COMMENCED WITHIN THE TIME PROVIDED THEREIN.  FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS, THE JUDGMENT OF THE COMMON PLEAS COURT IS AFFIRMED.  EXCEPTIONS.  ORDER SEE JOURNAL.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants, a city and its officials, challenged judgments of a common pleas court (Ohio) that permanently enjoined the levying and collecting of income taxes from appellee taxpayers under the provisions of certain ordinances on the ground that the ordinances were repugnant to the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayers' action sought to enjoin the collection of an income tax by the city under two different local ordinances. The first ordinance levied an annual tax of three-tenths of a percent on compensation and net profits of residents and nonresidents within the city. A tax of one percent was levied on the net profits of corporations having an office or place of business in the city. The second ordinance levied an annual income tax of seven-tenths percent upon the net profits of corporations earned as a result of business activities conducted in the city. The court's finding and judgment were the same as that of the common pleas court, and it remanded the cause to that court for execution and for costs and further necessary proceedings. The court stated that because there was apparent no reasonable basis for distinguishing the different rates as between natural persons and corporations, the first ordinance violated Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. For similar reasons, the second ordinance was also held to violate the taxpayers' constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court agreed with the judgments of the common pleas court that permanently enjoined the levying and collecting of income taxes pursuant to two of the city's ordinances and the case was remanded to that court for execution for costs and further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The landowner contested an assessment for a water line that ran by her farm, which had no buildings, for a subdivision. She contended the assessment was an unlawful taking of property for public use in violation of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 19 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The landowner contended the improvement was of no value to her and that the assessment, made upon a front-footage basis, was void. The commissioners proceeded on the theory that the landowner by her conduct was estopped to attack the assessment because she agreed to pay it over five years instead of three. Since the evidence failed to show that the landowner agreed to the assessment in consideration of the extension of the time of payment and that the commissioners were prejudiced by her silence, this contention was overruled. In any event, she was not estopped to contest an assessment in excess of the benefits conferred. The court held that, although no violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV was presented, the landowner's evidence showed the tentative assessment was made according to the front-foot rule without consideration or determination of the actual benefit conferred upon the landowner's property by the proposed improvement and the proposed improvement was of no substantial benefit to the landowner's property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The motion for a directed verdict was overruled and the cause continued for the purpose of taking testimony on behalf of the commissioners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff owners appealed from a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), in favor of defendants, Mahoning Valley (Ohio) Sanitary District, its directors, and the Auditor of Mahoning County, in the owners' action to declare unlawful and enjoin the certification and collection of a special assessment. They argued that defendants were without authority to levy the assessment for purposes other than the payment of bond retirement and interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The evidence showed that the District was organized to supply water for public use. The District's construction cost was financed by the sale of serial bonds maturing over a period of years; the principal and interest payments thereon were paid from the proceeds of annual tax levies on property in the city where the owners lived. Pursuant to Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 6602-78, the directors fixed the annual levies at 10 percent over the amount needed for payment of the bonds and interest. As a result, there was an unexpended cash balance in the District's bond retirement fund in excess of the amount needed to pay maturing bonds and interest. The District asserted that in accordance with a resolution it had adopted, the excess funds were to be used for making improvements to the District. On appeal, the court held that pursuant to &sect; 6602-78 and Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 6602-89, the directors were specifically authorized to transfer the excess fund into the District's maintenance fund, which was to be used for any legitimate objects of the District. The court concluded that the statutes, which were constitutional, imposed upon the directors a mandatory duty that the court was not permitted to enjoin.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">At the conversion meeting, 51 percent of the votes cast were in favor of conversion.

The dissenting shareholders claimed to be entitled to the fair value of their shares under Ohio Gen. Code &sect;&sect; 8623-72, 693-1. The dissenting shareholders argued that if they were denied relief in their first two claims, then the plan of conversion must be held unconstitutional, as constituting a taking of the dissenting shareholders' property without due process of law and impairing the obligations of their contracts as shareholders. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) the conversion plan was not fraudulent and was legally carried out under the guise of Ohio Gen. Code &sect;&sect; 9660-1, 9660-2; (2) the withdrawable share account in the amount of $ 135 was not only adequate but fairly could be considered high; (3) it was competent for the state to consent to and provide for the conversion of a state association into a federal association; and (4) &sect;&sect; 9660-1, 9660-2 were exclusive, complete, and controlling and not repugnant to the state or federal constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owner was notified that his building permit had been suspended, together with permits covering seven other properties, under an emergency ordinance. After all of the permits except the owner's were restored, the owner filed suit. At trial, the issue was whether the owner had made provisions to prevent water from accumulating in his cellars, as required by ordinance. The owner proffered testimony showing the terrain of the surrounding territory as bearing upon the possibility of complying with the ordinance. The trial court rejected the testimony, and the owner appealed. The court held that the trial court erred in rejecting the testimony because, if the general territory and terrain surrounding the owner's premises showed that others similarly situated were able to comply with the ordinance, such evidence would strongly favor the owner's contention that he could likewise conform to the requirements of the ordinance, as did the other permittees whose permits had been restored. The court further held that it would not pass upon the validity of the emergency ordinance because the village was not made a party defendant to the action as required by Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 12102-11.</SPAN></P>

The court found that bingo was a lottery and that those who conducted such games were in fact conducting a lottery in that such licensees sold the chance to win a prize for a stipulated consideration. The court found that about 40 bingo parlors had been issued licenses and less than three per cent of the gross receipts were given to charitable beneficiaries. The court held that neither the Legislature of the state nor the council of a municipal corporation had the power to authorize for any purpose, charitable or otherwise, the right to conduct a lottery or sell lottery tickets in direct conflict with the constitutional provision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Board's charge asserted that the osteopath induced a doctor's patient to go to an unlicensed practitioner for treatment, which treatment was illegal. The osteopath was charged with a violation of Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 1275 for having a professional connection with the practitioner. The Board suspended the osteopath, and the common pleas court affirmed. The osteopath appealed. The court held that the patient's testimony was adequate to sustain the violation of &sect; 1275. The osteopath asserted that a Board member's conduct during his hearing was prejudicial. The member had passed a note to the Board's counsel, seeking clarification of testimony. The court found that the note was not passed secretly and did not indicate any bias by the member and that the information sought was germane to the matter before the Board. The osteopath was not prejudiced because the member could have addressed the same inquiry to the witness aloud. The court denied the osteopath's assertion that the hearing process was unconstitutional. The Board's failure to serve the osteopath with a certified copy of suspension order was not prejudicial because he had notice of the action and his potential remedies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The ward applied to the trial court to have her guardianship terminated, alleging that the guardian was appointed on the ground of physical and mental incompetency, and that, while she was physically ill and required medical and nursing service, she was not mentally incompetent and was capable of looking after and taking care of her property. The trial court denied the application, and the ward appealed. The court held that the refusal to grant the application was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court noted that the trial court did not fully appreciate the influences that must have actuated the ward in signing the consent to the appointment of the guardian. The court also noted that, almost continuously from the date of the appointment, the ward refused to cooperate with the guardian, who ostensibly was named upon her request, and that such failure to cooperate was utterly inconsistent with the thought of consent as contemplated by Ohio Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After a will was successfully contested, appellants, the attorneys for the contestees, filed a motion for the allowance of attorney fees under Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 12082. The attorneys appealed an order and judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Tuscarawas County (Ohio), which overruled the motion. Appellee contestant-beneficiaries contended that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The contestant-beneficiaries argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it would deprive them, without due process of law, of a vested property right. On appeal, the court reversed the overruling of the motion for fees. The court stated there was no natural right to inherit property. The right to inherit property was a creature of statute. The court further stated that the validity of a will was presumed, and anyone who attacked the will could not complain of the will being defended or the costs of the defense being taxed against the estate. The statute did not interfere with the jurisdiction of the probate court. The statute simply gave the common pleas court authority to assess fees and costs. The probate court approved the payment of such costs. The statute did not limit the allowance of fees to the attorneys for the legal representative of the estate. The statute allowed fees to attorneys defending a purported will. The fact that the attorneys received compensation from the contestees did not preclude an allowance under the statute. The motion for fees was not filed prematurely because the proceeding in which the services were rendered was complete.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The lower court found that the ordinance did not unlawfully invade the sovereign power of the state and was not preempted by any state law. The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court. Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect; 8 provided that the state could impose a uniform or graduated tax. In addition Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 13 set forth that the state could limit the power of the municipalities to levy taxes. The court noted that the state had not passed an income tax, although authorized to do so, and consequently the state had not preempted the field of taxation. The tax as applied did not unreasonably discriminate between taxpayers merely because it was levied and collected from taxpayers that worked in the city on each payday. A board of review that was created by the ordinance did not violate the meaning of the City of Youngstown, Ohio Charter &sect; 88 and so it did not require a referendum vote because that board merely assisted the director of finance in the assembly of information necessary for levy and collection of the tax. In addition, the ordinance did not unlawfully delegate to an administrative official the duties of the city's council and its director of finance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The administrator brought an action against the relatives of a decedent under the provisions of Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 10506-67, which provided for the recovery of assets in an estate where a person was concealing, embezzling, conveying away, or in possession thereof. By virtue of that section, the probate court was empowered to determine the title to such assets. The question in the instant case related to a car, which was taken in the decedent's name and which was claimed by one of the relatives by reason of a gift inter vivos. The probate court entered a judgment in favor of the administrator. On appeal, the relatives contended that the trial court erred in holding that there was not a valid gift inter vivos. The court held that: (1) there was not a valid gift inter vivos of the car; (2) it was essential to the validity of a gift inter vivos that a transfer of the property in question be executed for the reason that there being no consideration therefor, no action would lie to enforce it; (3) to execute a gift inter vivos, there had to be a delivery of the subject thereof; and (4) in the instant case, the decedent did not irrevocably give up dominion and control over the chattel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants, an engineer and a conductor of a train, had blocked passage over a street for more than 10 minutes in violation of the ordinance. On appeal from their convictions, defendants contended, among other things, that the ordinance violated Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3 because it invaded the area of legislative power that was assumed by the Ohio General Assembly in enacting Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 7472 and that the ordinance violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 because it placed a limitation on interstate commerce. The court held that the City had not usurped the General Assembly's function. The court assumed that the City's council was aware of &sect; 7472 when it enacted the ordinance and, thus, intended to prohibit a different situation; the ordinance applied to trains that &quot;remained&quot; on a track while &sect; 7472 applied to trains that &quot;blocked&quot; the track. However, the court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional as an interference with interstate commerce.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The prisoner was convicted of the offense of felonious assault, and he was adjudicated as a mentally ill person. He was sentenced to imprisonment for not less than one year nor more than 10 years. Under the statute, a trial court was to submit a convicted defendant to an examination for a determination of his mental condition. The court held that a finding under the statute that a person was mentally ill, a mentally deficient offender, or a psychopathic offender constituted a final order on the matter. The court also determined that &quot;mental illness,&quot; as used in the statute, was used in the broadest sense as comprehending all types of mental diseases and mental deficiencies. The court held that the lower court that made the commitment was vested with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction over the release of the prisoner. The court held that the question of whether the prisoner was to be released was solely within the discretion of the public officers designated in the statute to care and monitor the prisoner. The court denied the prisoner's petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant Department of Liquor Control challenged a judgment by the Common Pleas Court of Franklin County (Ohio) in favor of appellee cafe operator in the operator's action for declaratory judgment that Ohio Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The cafe operator was the holder of a liquor permit. The Board of Liquor Control, however, revoked the permit and immediately entered the cafe and seized liquor. The Board intended to sell and dispose of the liquor. The operator filed an action seeking declaratory judgment that Ohio Gen. Code &sect;&sect; 6064-28 and 6064-40, which authorized the taking and disposition of the liquor, were unconstitutional. The trial court upheld this contention and decreed that the operator was entitled to have the liquor returned to him or to recover the fair value thereof. The court affirmed on appeal. The court noted that the liquor was legally manufactured and acquired. Under the law, legally acquired liquor did not become contraband or a nuisance per se upon the revocation or cancellation of a permit. The court found that the operator had a property right in the liquor at the time it was seized of which he could not have been deprived except according to law. The court held that the statutes in question violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the takings clause of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff prevailed in a personal injury action against defendant. The trial court granted defendant's motion for a new trial and plaintiff appealed. Defendant moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 12223-7 provided for appellate review of judgments and final orders, arguing that the order granting the new trial was not a final order. Plaintiff argued that a constitutional amendment effective January 1, 1945, permitted the legislature to enlarge the jurisdiction of courts of appeal and that the legislature had amended Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 12223-2 to extend the court of appeals' jurisdiction to orders granting new trials. The court noted, however, that plaintiff's petition had been filed in October 1946 and that the amendment to &sect; 12223-2 had not become effective until September 1947, so that the amendment was not applicable. The court stated that by judicial construction of Ohio Const. art IV, &sect; 6 (1912), in effect before the amendment of 1945, orders granting a new trial were not considered final orders from which an appeal could be taken. The court dismissed plaintiff's appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city's ordinance prohibited the sale of certain commodities in the parks, streets, sidewalks, and alleys of the city. On appeal, the court held that Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 3634 did not confer upon the city the power to enact the ordinance under consideration. The ordinance was not in harmony with Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 3672 because it violated the property right of the company, which was constitutionally protected against unwarranted and arbitrary interference by legislative bodies. The company's right to pursue its occupation was protected by Ohio Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 16, and by the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution. It could not have been successfully urged that the ordinance came within the police power granted to municipalities under Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3. The court concluded that the ordinance was unreasonable in that it destroyed a lawful business instead of attempting to regulate it. There was no evidence that prohibition as distinguished from regulation was essential to the public welfare. The court further concluded that the means adopted were not reasonable and appropriate to the professed end.</SPAN></P>

Defendants argued that the proof offered in support of the motion failed to show that a fair and impartial trial could not be had in the original county and sought a writ of prohibition against the current court and its judge. Respondents demurred to the petition in prohibition because the allegations thereof did not constitute a cause of action. The court overruled the demurrer and granted the prohibition. The court held that Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 13427-1, so far as it provided for a change of venue upon application of the state without the consent of the accused, was unconstitutional.

While in Ohio, defendant violated the terms and conditions of his parole resulting in a warrant for his arrest as a parole violator being issued in Illinois. The warrant was served on defendant in Ohio, and he was taken into custody by the sheriff. He petitioned the court for a writ of habeas corpus, which was denied. Defendant, on appeal, argued that &sect; 108-1 was unconstitutional. Illinois was not seeking defendant's return under the state extradition statutes. The court held that since the act applied uniformly to all parolees from states that were party to the compact, defendant could not complain that the statute deprived him of the equal protection of the laws.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The validity of plaintiff insurance company's proceeding for mutualization was attacked by defendants as dissenting minority shareholders. The action came before the appellate court for trial de novo on petition of plaintiff for a declaratory judgment. Although defendants contended that the shares held in a voting trust should have been voted by the trustees rather than the shareholders for a majority vote, the court found that the trustees did not have the power to destroy the beneficial ownership by sale. Since the majority of shareholders adopted the plan and voted down defendants' resolution for a different share price, the court concluded there was no fraud or illegality involved in the plan's adoption. Therefore the court denied defendants' request for equitable relief but declared that defendants had the statutory right to obtain the fair cash value of their shares.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The administrator brought an action against the insurer to recover death benefits under the insured's life insurance policy. There was evidence that the beneficiary named in the policy intentionally and feloniously killed the insured. The trial court entered a judgment for the administrator. On appeal, the court affirmed and rejected the insurer's contention that the administrator could not recover because the policy was not surrendered. If the insurer intended that the surrender of the policy was a condition precedent to recovery, it should have stated so in positive language. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to justify a holding that the killing was intentional and felonious. The beneficiary was barred from recovery and the administrator had the right to recover for the benefit of the estate. The trial court committed no error when it admitted into evidence the record of the criminal case in which the beneficiary pleaded guilty to manslaughter. The record of the coroner's inquest was admissible under Oh. Gen. Code &sect; 2855-11.</SPAN></P>

The corporation was arranged so that if a person paid annual dues they could receive discounted legal services from a list of participating attorneys. The bar association sought an injunction to prohibit what it characterized was the unauthorized practice of law, which the court granted. The court held that the corporation's plan was to provide prepaid legal services as contemplated by Model Code of Prof'l Responsibility DR 2-103(D)(6), which was not registered with the Supreme Court of Ohio, as required by that section. The court held that the corporation and each of its facets constituted the unauthorized practice of law by a corporation and they further constituted unauthorized activities by attorneys in violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The RTA proposed to extend bus service, and the bus companies sought injunctive relief on the ground that the expansion would cause financial harm. The taxpayer based his claim on the alleged illegal expenditure of tax revenues. The court overruled the motion and declined to grant injunctive relief. The court held that (1) the Miami Valley Regional Transit Authority (RTA) had a clearly established legal right to extend the bus service pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 306.31, (2) the RTA proposal did not constitute any expenditure of tax dollars, let alone an illegal expenditure, (3) it was not necessary for the RTA to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUC)) because the RTA was not subject to either the regulations or the jurisdiction of PUCO, (4) the taxpayer failed to show either a clear legal right to the requested preliminary injunction or that he would suffer irreparable damage if the injunction was not granted; and (5) the bus companies were not entitled to damages because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 306.36(B), which dealt with the power of an RTA to appropriate land by eminent domain, did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs, individual police and fire department employees, asked the court to issue a permanent injunction to restrain enforcement of Cleveland, Ohio, Ordinance 2350-74 (1974). The ordinance provided for the retirement of members of the police and fire divisions who attained the age of 65 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The complaint charged that the ordinance conflicted with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.34 and was unconstitutional. The court found that there was no question that the ordinance conflicted with &sect; 124.34, which provided that a city official's tenure was solely dependent on his good behavior and efficient service. The question then was whether an ordinance at variance with state law was per se unconstitutional. According to the court, the answer depended upon whether the ordinance was an exercise of the power of local self-government or an exercise of local police, sanitary and other similar regulations. Here, the court found that the ordinance was an exercise of the power of self-government and that therefore, the City had the power to enact the ordinance. In summation, the court held that the ordinance was an exercise by a charter city of its powers of local self-government and not a police regulation, and, therefore, was valid and effective even though it was at variance with state law. In addition, the ordinance did not violate the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of the state of Ohio, and was therefore, a constitutional enactment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court denied the request for a permanent injunction against enforcement of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed that &sect; 2917.11(A)(2) was unconstitutional because utterances must be confined to fighting words. The court did not find any Ohio statutes or decisions differentiating fighting words from other non-fighting but otherwise offensively coarse or unwarranted and grossly abusive words. Section 2917.11(A)(2) swept within it ordinary political expression and could be used to repress free speech. The court did not find any social value or social utility in &sect; 2917.11(A)(2).

The court determined that the proceedings complied with the minimal standards of due process. According to the court, the requirements of a more formal determination of facts were not involved because the students admitted to having a part in unauthorized hazing. The court noted that defendants' action was not arbitrary or capricious.

After a person was arrested without a warrant, he was to be brought, without unnecessary delay, before a court or magistrate having jurisdiction of the offense. The court held that the common practice of holding arrested persons for up to 72 hours before their initial appearance was unconstitutional. The court instead adopted a 12-hour rule subject to the facts and circumstances of each particular case. As such, every suspect arrested without a warrant and without charges having first been filed against him had to, within 12 hours after the arrest, be either formally charged, brought for an initial appearance. or be given the opportunity to have bail set.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued that &sect; 1513.16(B)(5) was unconstitutionally vague because the term substantial was not defined in the statute and because it was subject to different interpretations by administrative officials. The State contended that absolute precision or certainty was not required in passing the statute, and it was not necessarily void because it was susceptible to different interpretations, or had a meaning that was difficult to ascertain. The court dismissed the complaint. The court held that &sect; 1513.16(B)(5) was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite because it failed to satisfy recognizable standards of action. The court found that the word substantial appeared to be subject to so many variables of weather, waters, and variations in opinions, and viewpoints of enforcers of the statute, that it could not and did not furnish an applicable and meaningful standard of conduct. The court also found that &sect; 1513.16(b)(5) was unconstitutional because it failed to comply with due process requirements under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution for the reason that enforcement resulted in the taking of private property without compensation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the ordinance was unconstitutional in that it violated his right of freedom of expression guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

The court found that alcohol could be addicting so that one who had become addicted to it could become an involuntary drinker, that this addiction-chronic alcoholism was universally accepted medically as a disease, and that the symptoms appeared as a disorder of behavior characterized by unwilled appearances in public with actions inconsistent with the norm. The court specifically found that that chronic alcoholism was a disease and not a crime, and that to jail defendant, a diseased person, would be cruel and unusual punishment. Accordingly, the court found that Dayton, Ohio Rev. Code Gen. Ordinances &sect; 931-1 relating to habitual intoxication was unconstitutional and invalid.</SPAN></P>

The court first noted that the proposed child day-care center did not qualify as an educational use, public library or museum, which was a permitted use. The court pointed out that the child day-care center was not regulated by the Ohio Department of Education and that there was no requirement that the administrator or staff members hold teaching certificates. The neighboring property owners also contended that their operation fell within the category of home or office occupation, which did not violate the restrictions of the zoning ordinance. The court pointed out that office occupation meant a professional occupation of a resident on the premises such as a physician, surgeon or dentist. The court further noted that accessory use meant the subordinate use of property that was incidental to the main use of the premises. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 713.13 allowed the residential property owners to bring this action without exhausting administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that he had been charged with violating an unconstitutional law. The issue before the court was whether the mere possession of an alcoholic beverage, which was clearly not an inherently dangerous substance, in a city park, without any conduct by defendant that would indicate an intent to consume the alcoholic beverage in the park, could be made a crime by a city ordinance. The court determined that the city council had enacted an ordinance that prohibited the mere possession of an alcoholic beverage in a city park without requiring proof of an intent to consume the alcoholic beverage in the park while both state statutes and city ordinances permitted the sale, purchase, and possession of an alcoholic beverage everywhere else in the city. The court concluded that the city ordinance was improper because it did not require that possession of an alcoholic beverage in a city park either be knowingly done or done with intent to consume the alcoholic beverage in the park.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the motion to dismiss and held that the selling of subscriber names did not make out an invasion of privacy action. The court found that the selling of the names was a lawful act. The court also found that the class representative admitted that his action did not fall into the category of invasion of privacy torts. The court further found that that an unjust enrichment claim could not be based upon the lawful act of selling names and addresses. The court also determined that the instant action was not a proper class action under Ohio R. Civ. P. 23. Lastly, the court found that the claims were not typical of the other members of the class; that the class representative, a prominent lawyer, could not adequately represent the class; that the class representative's interest was not coextensive with that of the other members of the class; and that the individual members of the class did not have complete identity of interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The keywords of the ordinance in question were &quot;offensively coarse utterances.&quot; Although there were no Ohio court interpretations of this definition, the court noted that the dictionary definition for &quot;course&quot; was that which was offensive to a person of good taste or moral principles. The court further noted that although the proscribing of &quot;fighting words&quot; was clearly constitutional, the issue revolved around whether speech other than &quot;fighting words&quot; might possibly be included in the language proscribed by &sect; 648.04(a)(2). The court concluded that the ordinance was overbroad. The court held that in certain fact situations an utterance could be made which would not immediately cause a breach of the peace or inflict injury and yet would still be offensive to a person of moral principles and good taste. Consequently, the court reasoned that a law-abiding person might refrain from exercising his First Amendment rights under threat of this ordinance for fear of a penalty being applied for expression actually protected. Therefore, the court held that &sect; 648.04(a)(2) was overbroad because the same words might or might not be &quot;fighting words&quot; in different surroundings of time and place.</SPAN></P>

He had, by an unwarranted and unconstitutional delegation of powers from the legislature, exercised authority that was not his to accept not the legislature's to give.

Marketers filed a motion to dismiss and contended that the act applied to deceptive and unconscionable practices directed only to in-state consumers. The court denied the motion to dismiss and held that the act did apply to out of state consumers. The court found that the act was applicable to out of state consumers because it did not extend beyond the constitutional limitations on local legislative power, had not been preempted by any federal legislation, and did not impose an undue burden on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The plaintiff son of testator filed a motion for a declaratory judgment and construction of a will, asserting that a will provision was invalid because it violated the son's constitutional right to marry, and was against public policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The testator placed a provision in his will which provided that his two sons would receive a portion of his estate only on the condition that they each marry a Jewish girl whose both parents were Jewish, within seven years of the testator's death, and if the condition was not fulfilled, the share would pass to the State of Israel. Plaintiff son filed a motion for declaratory judgment and construction of the will, asserting that the condition violated his constitutional right to marry, and was unenforceable as contrary to public policy. The court rejected the son's premise that the condition violated the federal or state constitutions, because the provision did not restrict his constitutional freedom to marry, but only enforced the testator's restriction upon his son's inheritance. The court held that the right to receive property by will was a creature of the law, and not a natural right or one guaranteed or protected by either the state or federal constitutions. Further, the court held that the provision did not violate public policy because it constituted a partial restraint on marriage, which was a reasonable restriction, and was therefore, valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The board rejected the recommendation of the referee that the superintendent not be terminated and terminated his contract. The court held that: (1) Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 3319.01; (5) although there was questionable conduct on the part of the superintendent, it did not show misconduct of a sufficiently serious nature to justify termination of his contract Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayers were married couples. They sought to have several sections of the income tax law declared unconstitutional. The court granted defendants summary judgment, ruled that the income tax law was constitutional, and held that (1) Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5754.01(A), 5707.03(A) and 5707.04(A) were constitutionally valid because persons subject to the income tax were not subject to the tax imposed under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5707.03 and the intangible property tax imposed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5707.04 was excluded from taxable income under the income tax; (2) the fact that the intangible property tax imposed a different rate of taxation than found in the income tax did not violate equal protection; (3) the formula used to determine business done within the state found in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5747.21 was valid because it was based upon a uniform, fair, and practical standard; and (4) the requirement that married couples filing joint federal tax returns also file joint state income tax returns did not create a constitutionally impermissible classification of taxpayers because it was not palpably arbitrary and it did not constitute invidious discrimination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff elector sought a peremptory writ of mandamus to compel defendants, city, the secretary of state, a county board of elections, and the attorney general, to include the name of a withdrawn candidate for mayor on the general election ballot. The city cross-claimed against the board to force the listing of the withdrawn candidate on the ballot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Seven candidates ran for mayor in the primary. The board, as required by Cleveland, Ohio, Charter &sect; 10 (1971), listed the two most successful primary candidates as general election candidates. When one of the candidates withdrew, the board removed his name from the ballot. The elector sued to prevent the general election with only one candidate. The city cross-claimed against the board. The board replied that the candidate had a right to withdraw. The court found that the board had no discretion to accept the candidate's withdrawal. Because there was no procedure for withdrawal in the general election in Cleveland, Ohio, Charter (1971), but the charter incorporated state law, the default procedure of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3513.31 became applicable. Because &sect; 3513.31 failed to prove for a withdrawal, it was an invalid deprivation of the rights of the electors, which made it nugatory and without effect. Because &sect; 3513.31 was invalid, the act it was passed to replace, 1892 Ohio Laws 119, codified as Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 5000, remained unaffected and valid. Therefore, the charter had incorporated the &sect; 5000 procedure for the nomination of candidates to fill the vacancy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court ordered the board to employ the prior state statutory procedures for the nomination of candidates to fill the vacancy in the general election.</SPAN></P>

The city filed suit to compel the landowners to donate a portion of their land for the future widening of the street. The landowners filed a motion to dismiss, which the court granted, finding that what was questioned was the right to demand land and public improvements from a single owner for widening an existing and busy street in an old section of town as a condition to permitting any new construction other than a garage or outbuilding. Such an action was a taking and was unconstitutional as a taking without compensation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Ohio Legislature amended Ohio Rev. Code Ann. tit. 37 to delete the Air Pollution Control Board and to establish the position of Director of Environmental Protection as an independent agency of the State government. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3704.03 provided that the Director could adopt standards for the State as a whole or for various areas of the State. The State alleged that the landowner had violated Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3704.05(G) by allowing open burning on his property. On appeal, the court held that the Ohio Legislature unlawfully delegated a portion of its authority to make law to the Director. The enactment of the statutes creating and empowering the Director to become a law unto himself was unconstitutional. Further, the &quot;regulations&quot; adopted by the Director under the guise of that authority were unreasonable and lacked the ability to be uniformly enforced. Therefore, the landowner had not received the protection afforded to him by the Ohio Constitution and the United States Constitution with respect to due process. Accordingly, Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">It was only the 4 service station plazas operated by the corporation for which the Commission had been notified of the intent to limit the sale of gasoline and diesel fuel by the individuals using those facilities. Although the agreement did not explicitly require the corporation to sell to every customer all the gasoline and diesel fuel the customer desired, such a term was implicit in the requirement that the corporation service all of the needs of the customers utilizing the facilities it operated. Therefore, it followed that if the corporation refused to supply all of the needs of the consuming public at the facilities in question, there was a breach of the contract. The court further found that the attempted rationing or restricting of sales, in derogation of the parties' legal obligations to the public in maintaining the service station facilities, constituted an irreparable injury. In issuing the injunction, the court concluded by finding that the Commission had shown it lacked an adequate remedy at law, given that it would be inequitable for the corporation to determine unilaterally whether, or to what extent, it would perform.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant moved to quash the affidavit as being based upon an ordinance that was unconstitutional and void by reason of it being vague and indefinite. Defendant claimed that as used in the ordinance in question, &quot;reasonable and ordinary control&quot; was not defined so as to enable the ordinary citizen to determine what was or was not a violation. The court found that the ordinance in question simply prohibited the operation of a motor vehicle without exercising reasonable and ordinary control over such vehicle. The phrase, without exercising reasonable and ordinary control, as used in the ordinance, meant that one was required to operate his vehicle in the same manner as would a reasonably prudent person under similar circumstances. Section 2131.33, containing that phrase, was a precise and narrowly drawn ordinance, delineating its reach in words of common understanding, evincing a legislative judgment of Columbus City Council (Ohio) that certain specific conduct be proscribed. The court found that the ordinance under which defendant was charged was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The employees brought an action to have Rule IV declared invalid. The court held that Rule IV was unconstitutional and void.

The court held that a retroactive rule violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 and U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court further held that Youngstown, Ohio, Civ. Serv. Comm'n R. IV violated the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The right to travel was a part of the liberty of which a citizen could not be deprived without due process of law. The court determined that defendants produced no evidence of any kind from which it could determine the reasonableness of Rule IV.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city passed the Ordinance that provided for tap-in charges for the water system. The owners brought an action to challenge the Ordinance. The court granted a temporary restraining order, which was later made a preliminary injunction. The city then moved to dismiss the complaint. The court overruled the city's motion and made the preliminary injunction permanent. Evidence showed that the charge was greatly in excess of the cost to the city of supervising connections to the water line. In addition, the mayor indicated that the charge bore some relationship to the overall debt of the city's water system instead of bearing a substantial relationship to the cost of making the connection. The court also found that the Ordinance was discriminatory based on the waiver of the charges for certain properties. The discrimination was even more glaring as to vacant lot owners, who were given no opportunity to avail themselves of the waiver. The city was also estopped, based on prior conduct, statements, and representations made to various residents within the project, from levying a tap-in fee against the owners of lots and lands within the district.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The motorist was arrested for driving under the influence. He refused to submit to a chemical test, but later pled guilty. The Bureau suspended his operator's license, and the motorist appealed the suspension. The court overruled the demurrers. The suspension violated the due process guarantees of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. The court noted that in an earlier decision it had made the same determination, which the Ohio Attorney General had adopted, but the decision was never appealed. Because the Ohio Supreme Court had never directly decided the issue, the court found that its earlier rationale remained applicable. The court reviewed the decisions and comments upon its earlier ruling and declined to change its position. The court found that there was no proof that the motorist had the capacity to make a rational decision to refuse the test because of his intoxication. In addition, the court found that the administrative penalty of the license suspension constituted factual double jeopardy and a penalty in excess of the criminal penalty assessed for the guilty verdict without any determination that the motorist was a threat to public safety.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">An attorney's former client filed a disciplinary complaint against the attorney, in which she asserted false and defamatory statements. The bar association's investigation into the client's allegations revealed no professional misconduct on the part of the attorney. Thereafter, the attorney filed a defamation action against the client. After reviewing the law relevant to defamation in Ohio and other states, the court found in favor of the client and dismissed the attorney's complaint. The court concluded that the disciplinary proceeding against the attorney was considered a judicial proceeding, such that the client had an absolute privilege to make her allegations, whether they were false or not. Where a defendant had such absolute privilege, he or she was protected from liability even though defamatory statements were made with actual malice, in bad faith, and with knowledge of their falsity. Thus, the court held that because the client's statements were related to a judicial function, that of conducting attorney disciplinary proceedings, her communication was absolutely privileged even if the attorney had been harmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant filed a plea in abatement in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio). Defendant was arrested for possession of a harmful intoxicant, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.50(A). Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.99(N), defendant was treated as a subsequent offender and was indicted for possession of a harmful intoxicant, a felony for which the penalty upon conviction was imprisonment for from 1 to 10 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant had pled guilty twice previously to possession of a harmful intoxicant. Defendant was at all times indigent and appeared without counsel and without waiving counsel. The court sustained the plea in abatement and dismissed the case. Gideon established the rule that the right to counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment was applicable to the states by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, making it unconstitutional to try a person for a felony in a state court unless he had a lawyer or had validly waived one. The prior convictions of misdemeanors did not come within the purview of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.50(A), which imposed a mandatory duty upon the trial court to appoint counsel for an indigent accused. The court held that when an allegation of prior convictions of the misdemeanor of possession of a harmful intoxicant was used to enhance punishment, it effectively became a &quot;serious offense,&quot; which required that the records of the prior convictions show that defendant was represented by counsel, or advised of his right to counsel and waived his right to counsel, before it could be used in the subsequent prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The worker was injured and awarded temporary total disability benefits, but later received a 50 percent permanent partial disability award. The worker died, and the widow applied for death benefits under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.59. The Administrator denied the claim. The widow brought suit. The Administrator moved for summary judgment on the basis that there was no jurisdiction. The court denied the motion, noting that earlier judicial decisions had held much of &sect; 4123.59 invalid and holding that the remaining portion of &sect; 4123.59 was also invalid because it set up illogical classifications between partial and full disability where the injury caused the worker's death. The widow had a right to file the death claim under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 35, and the portion of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.59 that remained violated that right by setting up a statute of limitations that operated unequally, and therefore, was invalid. Because the right was constitutional, the widow had a right of action if she was able to prove that the injury to the worker caused his death, regardless of any provision in &sect; 4123.59. The court retained the case for a trial on the merits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court construed the motion for summary judgment as a motion to dismiss and denied the motion. The court declined to remand the case and retained the matter for a trial upon the merits.</SPAN></P>

The Director had applied to determine boundary lines of properties titled to the landowners but claimed by the State, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 123.611. The landowner filed a motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The lands in question abutted a reservoir constructed in 1832 to provide water to the navigable canal system that was then being developed. The State might have appropriated some of the lands in issue, but the lands so appropriated were not described by metes and bounds. The landowners took the position that res judicata prevented the State from relitigating an issue that they believed was previously decided against the State. The court denied the landowners' motion for summary judgment. The previous ejectment action brought by the State, in which the court ruled in favor of the landowner, had not decided the question of title to the contested land. It was evident that the land under the waters of the reservoir, which was part of the lands at issue, could not be titled in the landowners. The parties needed to recover on the strength of their own title and not on the frailties of the title of the adversary. The landowners' objections to the constitutionality of the procedure under &sect; 123.611 were mooted by the State having submitted the title question to the court in its counterclaim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff, a wife on behalf of herself and others similarly situated, instituted a declaratory judgment action seeking a determination that the requirement of a year's residence to file for divorce from defendant husband as provided in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3105.03 violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The wife and her minor children left the matrimonial home in a sister state, moved to Ohio, and declared that she intended to make her home in Ohio. The court found as a matter of fact that the wife had the necessary physical presence and animus manendi to make her a domiciliary. Noting that the undisputed testimony showed that the husband followed the wife to Ohio and threatened to kill her, the court further found that forbidding the wife to file for divorce on the ground that she had not yet attained a year's residence arose to a penalty on her having exercised the constitutionally protected right to travel. The court ruled that the wife's litigation was properly maintainable as a class action under Ohio R. Civ. P. 23. The court further ruled that an exceptional test, which asked whether the challenged classification promoted a compelling governmental interest, applied. The court determined that none of four distinct state interests, reconciliation, jurisdiction to grant a valid decree, administrative convenience, and not being a party to the hardship incident to surreptitiously obtained divorces, justified the one-year residency requirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court declared that the statutory provision requiring plaintiffs in actions for divorce and annulment to have been residents of the State of Ohio for at least one year immediately before filing their petitions, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court first determined that neither the First Amendment of the United States Constitution nor the Ohio Constitution could be construed as inhibiting a legislature from proscribing the commercial exploitation of a purported act of sexual intercourse. The court next found that no search warrant was necessary because the evidence filled the theatre as the films were projected upon the screen. The court also found that, according to prior case law, the First Amendment did not require a prior judicial determination of obscenity as long as the seizure was followed by a prompt institution of judicial proceedings to determine the issue of obscenity. The films were obscene because the dominant theme of the films appealed to the prurient interest in sex; the material was patently offensive; and the material was utterly without redeeming social value and contrary to the standards imposed by Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In competitive bidding for a public improvement project, bidders were required to submit affirmative action assurance plans to the city pursuant to Dayton, Ohio, Code of Gen.

City officials awarded part of the project to the lowest bidder and part of the project to a bidder with a higher bid but a better record of affirmative action compliance. Taxpayers filed an action to enjoin city officials from awarding any of the project to the higher bidder. The court entered a temporary restraining order and considered the merits. The court held that the ordinance was a proper exercise of the city's police power under Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 7. Nor did the ordinance violate competitive bidding. Government contracts were not secured to the lowest bidder, but to the lowest and best bidder. Capacity to assure a performance that complied with anti-discrimination laws was a part of the standard of a best bidder. Failure to give such assurances when specified was a lawful ground for the low bid's rejection. The ordinance did not give uncontrolled discretion to city officials.

The court agreed and concluded that the intent of the legislature in adopting &sect; 3375.50 was to provide needed funds for law libraries through fines, forfeitures, and penalties collected by municipal corporations for violations of ordinances that were similar to state statutes. Thus, in counties that did not have municipal courts, the police courts, mayor's courts, and county courts performed the same duties and functions, and it was reasonable to assume that the legislature meant to include those courts within the provisions of &sect; 3375.50.

The court differentiated between speech about the flag and conduct towards the flag. The court held that under recent free speech law, the statute was a constitutional regulation of conduct that did not significantly infringe on the First Amendment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In support of his motion to suppress, defendant argued, inter alia, that (1) the seizure was not preceded by an adversary hearing to determine whether the materials seized were constitutionally protected under the First Amendment; and (2) his arrest was invalid as a matter of law. In support of his motion to dismiss, defendant argued, inter alia, that the materials upon which the charges were based were constitutionally protected. Upon review, the court found defendant's arguments without merit. Defendant's arrest was valid. Defendant committed the alleged crime in the presence of the arresting officer who performed his duty as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2935.03. No search was necessary. The evidence filled the theatre as the film was projected upon the screen. The location of the film was open and apparent. The film, in the presence of defendant and immediately following his arrest, was voluntarily turned over to the arresting officer. Under the facts of the case it would have been ridiculous to require a search warrant to seize the film. The film seized was hard core pornography, and constituted obscenity that was not constitutionally protected speech or press.</SPAN></P>

The court sustained her motion to dismiss. It found that the congregating ordinance was unconstitutional. The ordinance violated due process in that the language was vague to the point that it lacked ascertainable standards of guilt and failed to give one fair notice of what acts were prohibited and would be punished. It violated one's right to free or peaceful assembly. To meet constitutionally acceptable standards, the ordinance had to prohibit not only congregating but also a course of criminal conduct on the part of those congregating. Addressing the incidence of and the increase in prostitution, gambling and narcotics was a legitimate area of concern for a municipality which could, by means of a properly drafted and constitutional ordinance, be made the subject of legislation limiting the exercise of certain First Amendment rights (including that of free assembly), in the valid exercise of a municipality's police powers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The board's assessment was a preliminary one, which was specifically limited to preliminary expenses pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 6117.251 and did not purport to divide any funds, land acquisition, or construction costs. The resolution levying the assessment was passed by the board following the failure of a petition to annex the area containing the landowners' property for the purpose of connecting the area's sanitary sewers with the surrounding city's sewerage treatment plan. The landowners appealed the assessment, and the court held that the board did not abuse its discretion in determining to build a treatment plant, which improvement was necessary for the public health, convenience, and welfare, and thus, the special assessments were valid. The court determined that the preliminary engineering, financial and legal work was of a necessary and beneficial nature to no one except the landowners and meant an increase in money value and a potential or added use and enjoyment of the landowners' property. The court thus concluded that as the special assessments levied were not in excess of the benefits received, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 6117.251 was therefore constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found in favor of the board's decision to build a treatment plant and thus approved the special assessments levied against the landowners' property.</SPAN></P>

According to uncontroverted testimony of the officers, the film depicted sodomy and acts of sexual intercourse and various sexual acts. Defendant provided the prices for the films and also had additional films of a similar nature. The informant purchased the films from defendant and the codefendant with money advanced by the police. On appeal, defendant complained that there was no prior adversary hearing on the question of obscenity. He also argued that &sect; 2905.34 was unconstitutional. The court held that: (1) because the prosecuting officers had procure the films by purchase, the dealer would suffer no injury if the films were later held not to be obscene; (2) because defendant had sold the films it became society's concern rather than a private right; (3) the Ohio Supreme Court had consistently upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 2905.34.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed, and found portions of the municipal ordinances unconstitutional and violative of Ohio Const. art.

Defendant's claim that he did not possess the requisite criminal intent was not a valid defense because his act was intentional rather than accidental. His mistake or lack of knowledge of what the statute said was not a recognized defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff, the Ohio Director of Highways, filed a petition with the court to appropriate defendant landowner's property pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 163. The summons was served on the landowner, who filed a motion requesting leave to file an answer. The landowner stated that his attorney had not filed an answer within the time set forth in the summons, and prescribed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 163.08, due to the attorney's inexperience.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The landowner was his attorney's first client after being admitted to practice. The attorney stated that while he read the answer date in the summons, he had never read &sect; 163.08; however, he was acquainted with the practice of the judge to grant a party's first request for leave. By the time he discovered &sect; 163.08, the answer date had passed. Section 163.08 mandated that no extension of time for the filing of an answer was to be granted to a defendant whose property was the subject of a petition for appropriation by a public agency. Although the court ruled in favor of the Director, it perceived the rule to be an extremely hard one that was far from universally well know, even among attorneys. Feeling that it was bound by precedent, the court held that the statute deprived the court of jurisdiction to extend the time for an answer. Further, the summons gave no fair warning to the landowner of the consequences of his failure to answer within the time allowed. The court also noted that the landowner did not make an &quot;informed and intelligent waiver&quot; of his right to have a jury assess the compensation due him as guaranteed by the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court awarded judgment to the Director and granted his petition. The court overruled the landowner's motion for leave to file his answer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff landowners filed an action against defendant city for a declaratory judgment on the issue of the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance. The landowners also filed an appeal from the action of the city council's decision to decline the application of the landowners for a change in existing zoning ordinances. The actions were consolidated for trial and the city filed a motion for a directed verdict in each case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The landowners sought a declaration that an ordinance affected an unconstitutional taking of their property, claiming that their property was unreasonably zoned for residential rather than business use. Subsequently, the city repealed the ordinance at issue and substituted in its place a new zoning code. The city council denied the landowners' application for a change in the existing zoning ordinances, engendering the landowners' appeal. The city's motion for directed verdicts in both actions alleged, inter alia, that the declaratory judgment action was moot. The court overruled the motion, noting that the landowners' property was subject to the same restrictive conditions under the new ordinance and held that the codification did not render the action moot. The court dismissed the appeal because the city council's refusal to change their zoning ordinances was a non-appealable legislative act under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2506. The court then entered a judgment for the city in the declaratory judgment suit, holding that the landowners failed to meet their burden to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that the zoning classification was unreasonable or arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was arrested based on information given to a detective by a informant who had been assaulted by defendant. He contended that the arrest warrant was invalid and was issued without a finding of probable cause. The court overruled defendant's motion to quash, finding that he had entered his appearance by waiving reading of the indictment, which waived all defects. The failure of the warrant to comply with the technical requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2935.18 did not prejudice defendant. Because the affidavit supporting the warrant alleged only the statutory description of the offense charged, the warrant was not issued upon a finding of probable cause. Further, the court held that, under the circumstances, the arresting detective had no probable cause and no reasonable ground to arrest defendant. There was no corroboration of the informant, who had a reputation for being a prostitute and a narcotics user. The detective had no prior association with her as an informant, there was nothing to indicate that she had a good reputation for truth and veracity, and due to defendant's assault upon her, she could not be considered disinterested in the outcome of the case.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the ordinance had a real and substantial relation to the public safety, as numerous subjects would want to change their sex identity in order to perpetrate crimes. In defendant's case, his conduct was the result of an irresistible impulse or a loss of will power rather than a deliberate act or violation of the provisions of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Complainant third-party candidate for United States Senator for Ohio initiated a proceeding under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3517.13 to challenge the nominating campaign practices of defendant major party candidate for the same office. The complaint charged the major party candidate with violation of Ohio's Corrupt Practices Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3517.08 to 3517.13. The court considered whether the section was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The section directed the court to conduct a summary investigation. If the court found that an accused candidate was in willful violation of the statute or had filed a false statement of campaign receipts and expenditures, the court was to transmit the decision and evidence so that prosecution could be initiated. The court determined that the section was a penal statute. The court ruled that the section violated the doctrine of separation of powers and was unconstitutional and void. The court noted that the judge who found a violation and ordered prosecution would ordinarily be the same judge that ultimately tried the case upon prosecution. The court concluded that the legislature intended the directions given by the court under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3517.13 to be mandatory, leaving no prosecutorial discretion. The court added that viewing the directions of the court as merely advisory could result in a conclusion that the section involved no infringement by the court on the powers of the executive department and was therefore constitutional. However, the court held that the subject of the proceeding was not then a &quot;justiciable matter&quot; within the meaning of the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The Bureau ordered that his license be suspended after he refused to submit to a chemical test. The driver sought review contending that Ohio Rev.

The court found that the right to operate a motor vehicle on a public street was not an unrestrained right but a privilege that was subject to reasonable regulation under the state's police power. The court further determined that physical tests like the Breathalyzer were real evidence and were not communication testimony that was protected by the privilege against self-incrimination. The court held that testimony regarding such tests was not subject to exclusion by reason of the failure to advise the person of his Miranda rights. The court found that the implied consent statute had not violated the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination clause or the Fourth Amendment search and seizure provision and further determined that the Bureau was permitted to suspend the driver's license for refusing to consent.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant urged the court to quash the affidavits for the arrest warrants for the reason that defendant was entitled to a prior judicial adversary hearing before the arrest warrant or the arrest took place. The court determined that the rules of the court did not provide for prior judicial adversary proceedings. The court explained that defendant requested action that was not regularly or ever accorded to an accused person in Ohio. The court noted that the procedure requested by defendant would have placed the court in the position of a law enforcement officer or agency. The court concluded that any person arrested under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.34 had every legal protection and right to prove his innocence. The court determined that its decision deprived no citizen of his or her constitutional rights of free speech or freedom of the press because the accused was entitled to his day in court and such rights were preserved by &sect; 2905.34. The court found that there was probable cause to support both affidavits so far as a violation of the Ohio obscenity statute was concerned.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Mayor's Court of New Boston (Ohio), which found him guilty of a violation of New Boston, Ohio, Ordinance 1976, relating to the regulation of parking on certain streets.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant challenged the validity of the ordinance. The court allowed the appeal because the right of appeal from a mayor's court to a court of common pleas had not been abrogated. The court determined that the ordinance was invalid because it not only attempted unconstitutionally to vest ungoverned and unbridled discretion in the safety director by failing to provide standards or criteria for his guidance, it also created rights in residents of a certain area superior to other citizens of the city. The court explained that the ordinance absolutely discriminated against all persons who were not residents of the city by making it an offense for them to park in the area. The court noted that no valid justification for the classification existed because it merely granted a parking right to residents in contravention of the well established rights of the general public. The court concluded that ordinances, in order to be valid, had to be general in their nature and impartial in their operation, and those which made an act penal if done by one person and not so if committed by another could not be sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant builder sought review of the decision of appellee board of adjustment (board) denying a building permit to the builder for the erection of a modern twelve-building apartment complex, the building of which was to be accomplished with funds provided under the Rent Supplement Act of 1965 and amendments thereto.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Builder was denied a permit to build an apartment complex by the building and zoning supervisor of the City of Lima, Ohio. Following public hearings, the board affirmed that denial. On appeal, the court examined the history of civil rights legislation and found the action of the board to be illegal because it was based upon superficially plausible reasons lacking a basis in general equitable principles and the prohibition against deprivation of rights provided by 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court found 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 to be a valid exercise of the power of Congress with present undiminished force, and that the denial of the permit was based upon an attempt to prevent minorities from moving into the area in which this low income housing project was to be built. The court stated that the board was free to hear any objections from any person in interest, it could not weigh objections whose effect was to deny a builder's constitutional right to private property on what the court called the meretricious ground of a risk of lowered property values. As a remedy, the court devised a scheme by which certain percentages of the units in the project would be reserved for minorities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court stated that it hoped it had examined the situation with sufficient thoroughness, care, and perception that the solution at which it arrived would constitute one small step for better housing in Lima, and a giant leap for better housing in Ohio and the United States. The court reversed the board's decision and remanded the case for proceedings based upon the court's direction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant filed a demurrer, challenging Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19, the drunken driving statute. Defendant claimed that the statute was unconstitutional as being an unreasonable interference with the private rights of the individual and having no reasonable relationship to the health, welfare, and safety of the general public.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued that &sect; 4511.19 dealt with a traffic matter and was unreasonable because it prohibited the act of operating a vehicle on public or private property, if under the influence of alcohol. He argued that the statute should have been modified to prohibit the act on highways and streets. The court overruled defendant's challenges. The section was modified and amended numerous times. The legislature meant that if a person was under the influence, he or she was not to operate a vehicle on highways and streets, private property where the public was usually invited, or private property where the public was not invited. The words, &quot;under the influence of alcohol,&quot; meant that defendant must have consumed some intoxicating beverage in such quantity that its effect on him was to adversely affect his actions, reactions, conduct, movements, or mental processes, in such manner as to deprive him of the clearness of intellect and control of himself that he would have otherwise possessed. Section 4511.19 was a reasonable restraint on defendant's actions, was not capricious, and did not violate his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
