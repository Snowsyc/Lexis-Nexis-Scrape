<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff judge and defendant state pension board of trustees stipulated, in Superior Court of the State of Delaware, in and for Sussex County, to certification of questions to state's highest court in plaintiff's action challenging the constitutionality of a 1998 amendment to Del. Code Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 5605, regarding judicial pension plans.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff judge contended that an amendment to the State Judicial Pension Act was invalid because it violated Del. Const. art. XV, &sect; 4 by diminishing an &quot;emolument&quot; of his judicial office. By amending Del. Code Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 5605(b), in 1998 to include a date certain when members of a closed judicial pension plan were required to exercise their option to participate in a revised judicial pension plan, the legislature diminished an emolument of judicial office unequivocally granted by a 1983 amendment: the right to participate in the revised plan at any time prior to the conclusion of active judicial tenure. The amendment violated Del. Const. art. XV, &sect; 4 by diminishing plaintiff's vested right to make that election. Plaintiff's execution of a pension election form pursuant to the unconstitutional amendment did not constitute waiver of plaintiff's vested right concerning the election.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Court held that amendment diminished plaintiff's vested right to elect, at any time, to participate in one of two judicial pension plans, violating constitutional provision prohibiting diminishment of emolument of judicial office, and that plaintiff's execution of election form pursuant to unconstitutional amendment did not constitute waiver of vested right.</SPAN></P>

If the sentence was imposed as the statutory minimum penalty for a habitual offender, then defendant was entitled to a hearing. If the sentence was not intended as part of a habitual offender sentence, Del. Sup. Ct. Admin. Directive 76 required the trial court to give reasons for its deviation from the sentencing guidelines.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death, appealed a decision from the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, which denied his motion for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. The superior court denied his motion for postconviction relief, and defendant appealed. Defendant asserted numerous claims alleging ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and on direct appeal, in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VI. The court affirmed the denial of postconviction relief, finding that defendant had failed to demonstrate any error of law or abuse of discretion requiring reversal. The court found the majority of defendant's claims procedurally barred under Del. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 61(i)(3). In the ineffective assistance context, defendant challenged the trial court's ruling that he not argue or discuss the facts surrounding the murder during allocution at the penalty phase. The record clearly established to the reviewing court that defendant had consciously decided he was not going to present mitigating circumstances at the penalty phase. Grounding its decision solely on Rule 61(i)(3) and the Delaware death penalty statute,&nbsp;Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4209(c)(2), the court found that defendant was not prejudiced by the trial judge's overbroad limitation on allocution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that defendant failed to demonstrate any error of law or abuse of discretion requiring reversal, and affirmed the lower court decision denying defendant's request for postconviction relief. The case was remanded to the trial court for the purpose of setting a new execution date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his convictions, by the Superior Court in and for Kent County (Delaware), of unlawful sexual contact and attempted unlawful sexual intercourse with his niece. Appellant asserted that Delaware's tender years statute,&nbsp;Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 3513, used to introduce out-of-court statements made by his niece, violated the Confrontation Clause of the U.S. Constitution and Del. Const. art. I, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's convictions for unlawful sexual contact and attempted unlawful sexual intercourse with his niece. The trial court, pursuant to Delaware's tender years statute,&nbsp;Del Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 3513, admitted out-of-court statements made by the four-year old niece to her mother, a pediatrician, and the police. The court rejected appellant's argument that &sect; 3513 was unconstitutional because it violated the Confrontation Clause of the U.S. Constitution and Del. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The court found that &sect; 3513's requirement of a judicial determination of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness rendered it constitutional. The court further found that the statute was constitutionally applied in appellant's case when the court concluded in a closed hearing, outside the presence of appellant, that the child was competent to relate what is true and what is false and demonstrated a persistent refusal to testify because of fear or similar reasons. The court also found that the state's formal notice of its intent to introduce the child's statements on the day of trial was sufficient when appellant was aware of the statements and was not prejudiced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's convictions. The court found that the tender years statute was not unconstitutional when it required a judicial determination of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. The court found that the statute was constitutionally applied in appellant's case and that the state's notice of the intent to use the statute, given the day of trial, did not prejudice appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State appealed the decision of the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court that Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 4177 was void as it was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. The cases involved driving while intoxicated charges against two criminal defendants, who had been in traffic accidents and alleged that after, rather than before, the accidents they consumed alcohol.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed a ruling by the appellate court, which held Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 4177 void for overbreadth and vagueness. The ruling involved two separate cases in which defendants were involved in accidents, alleged that they consumed alcohol after the accidents, and were arrested after they tested above .10 for blood alcohol concentration (BAC). The court held that as &sect; 4177 did not require the state to prove, as an element of the offense of driving while intoxicated, that the defendants had a BAC of .10 or greater when they drove, as compared to after they drove, it was unconstitutionally overbroad and void for vagueness. The court held the legislature intended &sect; 4177 to prohibit intoxication only while driving and, therefore, the state was required to prove intoxication while driving. The court held &sect; 4177's provision of an affirmative defense, which allowed a defendant to prove that his BAC was .10 or over because he consumed alcohol after he drove, impermissibly shifted to a criminal defendant the burden of disproving an element of proof and, therefore, violated the due process clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court that the driving while intoxicated statute was void for vagueness and overbreadth as the legislature intended to proscribe intoxication while, not after, driving. The court held an affirmative defense violated a defendant's due process rights as it shifted from the state the burden to prove that the defendant was intoxicated when he drove.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A shareholder in a Canadian corporation filed an action against a Delaware corporation, seeking to enjoin the Delaware corporation from acquiring a minority shareholder's interest in the Canadian corporation and from implementing any changes in the Delaware corporation's transfer pricing polices or otherwise undermining the Canadian corporation's profitability. The lower court granted the Delaware corporation's motion to dismiss the shareholder's action. On appeal, the court found that the equitable relief sought by the shareholder could only be granted in the courts of Canada, as those courts were defined in &sect; 2 of the Canada Business Corporations Act (Act). The court explained that it was the intent of the Parliament that actions brought under the Act be brought only in the courts of Canada.

Defendant confessed to police and his identity was later confirmed through testing. Defendant stood trial on various charges arising from the incident and a jury found him guilty of all counts. The trial proceeded to the penalty phase and the same jury recommended the death penalty. The lower court concurred and defendant appealed. The court affirmed the holding of the lower court and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court held that the lower court had not abused its discretion by denying severance and that where evidence of one crime would have been admissible in the trial of another crime, there was no prejudicial effect in having a joint trial. The court held that defendant's sentence of death was proportionate when compared with the sentences imposed in Delaware's universe of cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling of the lower court, which convicted him on three counts of murder first degree, two counts of burglary second degree, one count of unlawful sexual penetration first degree, one count of unlawful sexual intercourse first degree, one count of arson first degree, and one count of aggravated harassment and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred by failing to grant his motion for severance, denying his motion for a continuance, allowing improper statements to be made before the jury, not requiring the jury to determine which co-defendant was the accomplice and which was the principal, and finding aggravating circumstances. Defendant contended that his pending felony theft charges were inadmissible and that the imposition of the death penalty was arbitrary and capricious and disproportionate. The court disagreed with defendant and affirmed both the conviction and the sentence imposed. The court held that defendant was not denied any specific trial rights or prejudiced by a joint trial. Moreover, the court held that no error occurred as a result of the denial of defendant's continuance motion because defendant waited until the actual day of trial before intimating that he wanted a new attorney. Finally, no prejudicial statements were made before the jury regarding the prosecutor's comments. Thus, defendant was not prejudiced during the guilt or innocence phase of the trial, and no abuse of discretion occurred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner prosecution sought a writ of mandamus that would direct the family court to set aside its award of attorney fees and costs against the prosecution for its failure to promptly and voluntarily produce all properly discoverable Brady material to a juvenile against whom the prosecution had initiated delinquency proceedings. The family court had refused to consider the prosecution's untimely response to the juvenile's motion for fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution initiated delinquency proceedings against a juvenile accused of unlawful sexual conduct. The juvenile requested certain Brady materials from the prosecution, which the family court determined in camera was relevant and discoverable evidence. The prosecution resisted production and the family court granted the juvenile's motion to tax the prosecution with attorney fees and costs for the juvenile's efforts to compel discovery. The prosecution argued that the family court went beyond its jurisdiction in awarding attorney fees because Family Court Criminal Rule 16(f) (the rule) did not authorize such an award. The court agreed and granted the writ of mandamus. The court noted that without mandamus, the prosecution would have had no means of redress available at law because it was not given a statutory right to appeal the grant of attorney fees under Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 1053. The court rejected the juvenile's argument that the language &quot;other such order&quot; in the rule granted the family court the power to award fees and noted that under the canon of ejusdem generis, general language following a more specific enumeration was not to be construed in its widest sense.</SPAN></P>

The prisoner sought a writ of mandamus requiring the warden to deduct from his four-year sentence the good time credits he had earned while serving that sentence. The trial court granted the writ. On appeal, the court reversed. The computation method the prisoner sought and ordered by the trial court would lead to the unreasonable result of conditionally releasing the prisoner from his sentences imposed after the Act only to have him immediately reincarcerated to serve out the remaining time left on the sentences imposed before the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The family court awarded custody of the minor child to her father. When the father died, the mother filed a motion to modify the outstanding custody order, and the stepmother filed her own petition for custody. The family court determined that it was in the child's best interest to remain with the stepmother. On appeal, the mother challenged the validity of the stepparent custody statute. The court affirmed and held that the stepparent custody statute was the most recent expression of legislative intent in the limited circumstance where a stepparent sought custody after the death of the natural custodial parent. The court concluded that the statute superseded the more general statutory provisions that gave preference to natural parents unless the child was dependent or neglected. The court found that the statute adequately protected the natural parent's right to due process because it did not sever the natural parent's relationship with the child and permitted the natural parent to seek modification of custody at any time. Moreover, the statute modified a natural parent's rights only in cases where the other natural parent had custody of the child prior to his or her death.</SPAN></P>

The lease on the liquor store ended, and the liquor license applicant sought to move the liquor store approximately 1,500 feet.

The liquor license applicant commenced suit and challenged the constitutionality of the statute. The trial court affirmed the Commission's decision. The liquor license applicant sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held: (1) the minimum distance requirement of the Liquor Control Act, while arbitrary at times and not the best way to promote public welfare, was rational in light of the record; (2) the Liquor Control Act did not involve a suspect classification, thus, the proper level of review was whether the legislative decision in enacting the Liquor Control Act was rationally related to any legitimate government objective or purpose; and (3) the plausible difference in law enforcement capability provided a rational basis upon which to distinguish between incorporated and unincorporated areas in licensing liquor stores.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's position was that Del. Code Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 4763(a)(3) was unconstitutionally vague since it punished addicted repeat offenders more severely than non-addicted repeat offenders, and more severely than repeat drug offenders than did Del. Code Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 4751(d)(2). Defendant was an addicted offender. The supreme court, in affirming, stated that the test for determining whether a criminal statute was unconstitutionally vague was whether the statute was specific enough to give notice to a person of ordinary intelligence of the conduct prohibited. The test was not whether the statute achieved unreasonable or absurd consequences (namely, punishing addicted repeat offenders more severely than non-addicted repeat offenders). Section 4763(a)(3) was clear and unambiguous; it did not criminalize any activities; rather, it merely established the additional sentences for those individuals who had twice been found guilty of violating Del.

The court concluded that Delaware did not have a procedure for an appeal of a departure from the sentencing guidelines and that the court did not have jurisdiction to entertain such an appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, which denied his request for relief from his conviction for first degree murder, first degree burglary, possession of a deadly weapon by a person prohibited, and possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony, and from his sentence to death by lethal injection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of murder in the first degree, burglary in the first degree, possession of a deadly weapon by a person prohibited, and possession of a deadly weapon during commission of a felony. He was sentenced to death by lethal injection. The sentence was affirmed on appeal. The inmate filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, which was denied. He then filed motions for postconviction relief based on the ineffective assistance of counsel. The trial court denied the motions. On appeal from the denial, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the inmate's motions for postconviction relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel because the inmate failed to show what course of action his attorneys should have presented or undertaken that would have resulted in a different outcome at trial. The court also held that three jurors who were removed because they were personally against the death penalty were not improperly excluded. Further, the court found that the state's theory of the homicide at trial was not impossible and that the state did not improperly exclude a potential juror for gender-related reasons.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, in and for Kent County (Delaware), which convicted him of a stalking offense, offensive touching, and protection from abuse order violations. He only appealed from the stalking offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his conviction for stalking was based upon an inadequate jury instruction. Second, he argued that Delaware's stalking statute violated the U.S. Constitution because it provided a content-based preference for one means of expressive behavior labor picketing. The court affirmed, finding neither contention had merit. Defendant failed to prove plain error as to an inadequate jury instruction. In the context of defendant's trial on the charge of stalking, the additional language in the indictment that was read to the jury was unnecessary but not prejudicial. Defendant's constitutional argument was that because lawful labor picketers were exercising one form of First Amendment freedom of expression, a criminal statute that might otherwise be applicable to them is unconstitutional on its face if it exempted their behavior based on the content of their &quot;speech.&quot; A Delaware criminal statute could not, however, impose liability upon what was otherwise constitutionally protected First Amendment freedom of expression. Accordingly, one who engaged in &quot;lawful labor picketing&quot; could not be convicted under Delaware's stalking statute, even without any specific exception.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, school group and an individual school, sought a declaratory judgment against appellees, state, treasurer, and state school district, that an amendment to Del. Code Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 1318, could not be applied retroactively to accrued benefits. The Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County held that the amendment could be applied to unused sick leave but not to unused annual leave. The parties sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's ruling that the amendment did not constitute an unlawful impairment of contract with respect to sick leave. The court found that under the statute, an employee did not acquire a contractually secured right to cash-in accumulated sick days until retirement. Thus, the court held that there could be no vesting of rights to accrued sick leave sufficient to prevent modification by law until retirement status was achieved. However, the court held that there was insufficient evidence to support the lower court's determination that, as applied to accrued annual leave, the amendment was unconstitutional because it impaired benefits earned prior to the date of the amendment. The court agreed with the state that there was no evidence that the legislature intended to create a contractual right to cash-in unused annual leave prior to retirement and that there was insufficient evidence of inducement or reliance sufficient to establish estoppel. Thus, the court remanded this issue so that the lower court could obtain further facts to support its rationale for finding the amendment unconstitutional with respect to accrued annual leave.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court's judgment as to the unused sick leave was affirmed. The lower court's judgment as to unused annual leave was remanded for further development of the record on this issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent husband appealed a judgment of the Family Court of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, which granted petitioner wife's petition for an extension of an order of protection from abuse (PFA). The issues included whether the husband's claims were fairly presented to the trial court, as required by Supr. Ct. R. 8, and, if not, whether the trial court committed plain error in its rulings on the husband's claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the husband argued that the grant of authority to Family Court Commissioners to hear and decide cases constituted an improper delegation of judicial authority, that the Family Court judge erred in reviewing the case on the record and not holding a de novo hearing, that the PFA statute was unconstitutionally vague, and that the statute violated substantive due process. After examining the record, the court concluded that the first three claims were not fairly presented to the trial court and were therefore waived. Further, when the husband requested de novo review of the original PFA order, a Family Court Judge affirmed on the basis of the record, without conducting a new hearing, yet the husband did not appeal. The court found no compelling interest of justice that mandated an exception to the waiver doctrine embodied in Rule 8. Pointing out that the husband raised the fourth issue for the first time on appeal and had not raised it in an earlier proceeding in which the original PFA was issued, the court held that the fourth issue was barred by the doctrine of res judicata.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The General Assembly acted to alter the structure of the county's city government through a reorganization of the council. This was done to limit lame duck sessions of council and create a redistricting plan. Under the enactment, the council members' terms were shortened but their pay and benefits were not affected by the change under the express mandate of the enactment. The council challenged the authority of the General Assembly to make the changes. A prior reorganization of the council had expressly reserved the right to modify the terms of the members of the council and the court affirmed. An office created by the legislature could be modified, abridged or abolished by the legislature unless it offended a constitutional limitation. No member suffered personal financial detriment. Though the statute, which did not directly extinguish any term of office, might result in such, this was only incidental to the overall benefit, the elimination of lame duck sessions. As there was a presumption of constitutionality, the council had the burden of showing the reorganizational act was not constitutional and the court found, considering the facts, this burden had not been met.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a ruling from the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, which convicted defendant of burglary first degree, assault first degree, possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony, and possession of a deadly weapon by a person prohibited.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the victim were involved in a &quot;love triangle,&quot; which defendant apparently could not accept. One night after the victim's son had gone to bed, defendant pushed his way into the victim's home and viciously assaulted her. The victim's son awakened, ran into the living room, and found the victim bloody and unconscious near a floor fan that had a base with two metal crosspieces. The victim's head showed evidence that defendant had slammed the victim's head against the fan base. The state urged that the fan constituted a deadly weapon pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 222(5), (6), and won convictions. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed the convictions. The court held that from the standpoint of criminal culpability that it mattered little whether a perpetrator picked up an object and used it to strike another person or took the person's head and slammed it against the object, producing the same result. There was no reason not to treat the fan base as an instrumentality to cause serious physical injury and thus deem the fan base a deadly weapon. Even though defendant did not touch the fan base, he still exercised control over it and used it as a weapon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a decision of the Court of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County to dismiss his habeas corpus petition, and to deny his motion for postconviction relief pursuant to Super. Ct. Crim. R. 61. Appellant alleged error in the trial court's failure to rule on his motion for a new trial. Appellant's conviction for possession with intent to deliver cocaine and conspiracy second degree was affirmed on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a pro se motion for postconviction relief under Super. Ct. Crim. R. 61 on the ground that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during trial and on appeal. Appellate counsel filed a motion to withdraw as counsel pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 26(c). The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court did not rule on appellant's motion for a new trial because the trial court had not issued a final judgment on that motion, and the court lacked jurisdiction. The trial court correctly dismissed the petition for habeas corpus relief because state habeas corpus proceedings were supplanted by postconviction proceedings pursuant to Super. Ct. Crim. R. 61(a)(2). The trial court properly denied the petition for postconviction relief because appellant failed to show that the actions of his counsel, at trial and on appeal, fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, or that there existed a reasonable probability that but for unprofessional errors by his counsel, the result of the trial would have been different. Appellant therefore failed to establish cause and prejudice as required by Super. Ct. Crim. R. 61(i)(3).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, which the Superior Court denied. The court affirmed. The Superior Court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion to withdraw his plea based on defendant's allegation of a defective plea colloquy. The Superior Court properly informed defendant of the applicable sentencing provisions under the Truth in Sentencing Act and he understood that he was to have no contact with either of his daughters and no unsupervised contact with his children during any period of probation. There was no merit to defendant's assertion that he should have been permitted to withdraw his guilty plea because the plea was not entered knowingly and voluntarily. Defendant's argument that he should have been permitted to withdraw his guilty plea because he was legally innocent of the charges against him was based on his misunderstanding of the applicable statutes. Finally, the guilty plea was not obtained in violation of his right to effective assistance of counsel. Defendant alleged no facts to establish that his counsel's conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, or that counsel's conduct was prejudicial to him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and convicted of stalking the victim after repeatedly following her and calling her at home. Defendant was ordered to have no contact with the victim for two years. At the end of that period defendant began following the victim repeatedly until she summoned the police. Defendant claimed his appearance near the victim was coincidental. The court affirmed defendant's conviction for stalking. The stalking statute,&nbsp;Del Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1312A, was not void for vagueness. The statute did not require repeated harassment as defendant claimed; instead the statute required repeated following. In any event, considering his first conviction, defendant had to have known his actions constituted harassment. Defendant's behavior was not constitutionally protected. Restricting the persistent following of another on the public roads served the legitimate purpose of protection of others. The trial court did not err in admitting defendant's prior conviction. Defendant was not prejudiced by the state's tardy notice of intent to use the evidence and the evidence was relevant under Del. R. Evid. 404(b) to show defendant's absence of mistake in following the victim.</SPAN></P>

In so ruling, the court noted that such claim was not raised on direct appeal, and his trial counsel's failure to obtain the evidence was reasonable, as other evidence indicated that the other escapees were not present at the murder scene. The defendant's claim that the prosecution improperly failed to disclose Brady material was also procedurally barred. In so ruling, the court held that a witness' change in testimony was not Brady material, as it was not favorable to the defense. The court also rejected, as procedurally barred, defendant's claim that jurors were improperly excused. Defendant failed to show he was prejudiced from the failure to raise such claim on direct appeal, because the exclusion of jurors due to their opposition to the death penalty was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two questions were certified from the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for Kent County and were excepted by the court for decision pursuant to Del. Const. art. IV, &sect; 19 and Del. Sup. Ct. R. 41. The questions pertained to attorney's fees awarded in relation to a proceeding before intervenor Industrial Accident Board (board) in a cause of action between appellant injured employee and appellee employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two certified questions were accepted by the court regarding proceedings with the board. At the time that the court accepted the certified questions it was unaware that the governor had signed into law 70 Del. Laws 129 (1995), which amended Del Code Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 2126. Thus the court dismissed the certified questions as improvidently granted because the important and urgent reasons no longer justified consideration of the certified questions as required under Del. Sup. Ct. R. 41(a)(i). The court found that prior to the amendment effected by the new law, Del. Code Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 2126 provided fees for attorneys services under the Workers' Compensation Law, Del Code Ann tit. 19, &sect; 2101 et seq., and were subject to approval of the board. Del Code Ann., tit. 19, &sect; 2127 had required the board to allow, as attorney fees, an amount not to exceed $ 2,250 and prohibited an attorney from charging the client more than that. The new law amended Del Code Ann. tit 19, &sect; 2126 to remove any reference of attorneys, and that section applies only to physicians now. The court noted that the new bill's constitutionality was not before the court and declined to consider it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In seeking the writ of prohibition, the inmate contended that the superior court lacked jurisdiction over his prosecution.

The court had authority to issue a writ of prohibition to prevent a lower court from exceeding the limits of its jurisdiction if the jurisdictional defect alleged was clear from the record and if the petitioner had no other adequate and complete remedy at law to correct the trial court's allegedly erroneous act. The right to appeal the conviction was generally a complete and adequate remedy to review all of the questions presented in a criminal proceeding. The court found that the superior court had jurisdiction to accept the guilty plea as the offenses to which the inmate pleaded guilty were classified as felonies and were apparently within the superior court's jurisdiction by virtue of 11 Del. C. &sect; 2701(c). The court also found that &sect;&sect; 761 through 775 of Title 11 had not been declared unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the 138th General Assembly, requested an advisory opinion from the justices of the Delaware Supreme as to whether or not board and commission members appointed under Titles 23 and 24 of the Delaware Code are &quot;public officers&quot; for the purposes of Del.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The justices accepted the general assembly's request for an advisory opinion and framed the legal question as concerning whether board and commission members appointed under Titles 23 and 24 of the Delaware Code were &quot;public officers&quot; for the purposes of Article XV, &sect; 5. &sect; 5 provided, in part, that all public officers would hold their respective offices until their successors were duly qualified. 23 Del.

Each appointed board or commission member possessed the essential characteristics of a public officer. The members were authorized by statute to exercise part of the state's sovereign powers. In discharging the responsibility of licensing various professions, those boards or commissions promoted the public health, safety and welfare.

The Superior Court of Delaware in New Castle County entered an interlocutory order ruling that Del.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured persons brought claims against the state transit authority because they were injured in bus accidents. The state transit authority had several million dollars of liability insurance coverage, and the injured persons claimed that under Del. Code Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 6511, the state had waived its sovereign immunity to the full extent of its insurance coverage. The state transit authority claimed that under Del. Code Ann. tit. 2, &sect; 1329, the state had only waived its sovereign immunity up to $ 300,000. The court held that Del. Code Ann. tit. 2, &sect; 1329 was controlling. In so holding, the court ruled that (1) Del. Code Ann. tit. 2, &sect; 1329 prevailed because it was the more specific of the two statutory provisions and the later enacted of the two; (2) the classification scheme of &sect; 1329 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because it was rationally related to a legitimate state interest; and (3) &sect; 1329 did not deprive the injured persons of their right under Del.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The regulatory council association argued that the corporation's use of the term &quot;engineered&quot; in its trade name violated 24 Del.

The court held 1) that the lower court erred in finding that &sect; 2825 was unconstitutional as applied to the corporation because the statute only limited the use of the term &quot;engineer,&quot; and the statute thus passed First Amendment scrutiny because it was reasonably tailored to serve a substantial state interest; 2) that the corporation's use of the term &quot;engineered&quot; did not violate the statute because the regulatory council did not prove that a reasonable person would have been misled to believe that the corporation was entitled to practice engineering; and 3) that the corporation's counterclaim was moot because it was not deprived of a constitutional right.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the lower court did not err in holding that the Division's reunification efforts between the mother and the children were reasonable, and its finding that it would not be feasible for the Division to have attempted reunification between father and son. The mother contended that the lower court violated her due process rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The court held that the lower court did not violate the mother's right to procedural due process. She received ample notice of the impending proceedings, had adequate opportunity to consult with court-appointed counsel and prepare for trial, and was obviously aware of the ramifications upon her parental rights should the lower court find as the Division requested.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of first degree robbery and of other crimes. The district court denied on the merits his first motion for postconviction relief. The court dismissed the inmate's appeal from that order because the inmate failed to timely file his notice of appeal. The superior court refused to consider the inmate's second motion for postconviction relief, holding, pursuant to Superior Court Criminal Rule 61(i)(4), that the claims had been adjudicated in connection with the first postconviction motion and that reconsideration of them was not warranted in the interest of justice. In his second motion, the inmate contended that the actions for which he was arrested did not constitute robbery. Finding that the trial court rejected that contention on the merits in ruling on the first postconviction motion, the court held that the superior court was not required to reconsider it in the later motion simply because his claims were refined or restated. The court also held that the inmate's failure to perfect a timely appeal from his first unsuccessful postconviction motion was no reason for the court, in the interest of justice, to reconsider his previously adjudicated claims.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of assault in the first degree and related crimes. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defendant did not object to the jury charge at trial and thus waived the objection on appeal. The court further held that there was no plain error where the trial court read the carjacking injury statute,&nbsp;Del.

The court also found that Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 222(2), 604(b) and 613(a)(8)(e) were not unconstitutionally vague, because defendant's actions fell within a common understanding of the language.</SPAN></P>

On appeal of the trial court's imposition of the death penalty, defendant's counsel claimed that the trial judge's instructions were flawed because the jury could have found defendant guilty without ever finding that he specifically intended to kill. The court affirmed and held that the jury's finding that defendant was present at the scene and wielded the weapon that killed the victim was supported by the evidence. Also, the sentence was imposed fairly and did not violate defendant's Eighth Amendment rights or state law where the evidence established that defendant actually killed the victim. Finally, the sentence was proportional to the crime where the murder was gruesome, unprovoked, vicious, brutal, unjustified and heinous, and an analysis of defendant's intentions, expectations, and actions showed a level of culpability sufficient to justify the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In light of passage of 69 Del. Code Ann. tit. 69, &sect; 205, the Family Court of the State of Delaware, New Castle County certified five questions of law regarding jurisdiction over a defendant who was arrested when he was 17 years old, but adjudication would not have occurred until he was 18 years old.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because defendant was 17 years old at the time of his arrest, he was subject to the jurisdiction of the Family Court. Under the statutory scheme in place at the time of his arrest, defendant fell under the original jurisdiction of the Family Court. The statutory scheme was then altered after defendant's arrest. Under the language of the amendment, if a child reached his 18th birthday prior to adjudication on a charge of delinquency arising from acts that constituted a felony; the Family Court must automatically transfer the matter to Superior Court. Defendant then turned 18 years old and the Family Court certified questions to the court for resolution on jurisdiction. The court concluded that the amendment violated the constitutional guarantees of equal protection of the laws under the federal constitution and due process of law under both the federal and Delaware constitutions. The court opined that the amendment divested the judiciary of its independent role in assessing the evidentiary basis of a charge against a child. The court concluded that the distinctions drawn by the amendment were patently arbitrary and bore no rational relationship to a legitimate government interest.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the convictions, holding that the selection of death-qualified jurors was proper, the seizure of items of defendant's clothing was incident to lawful arrest, the search warrant was properly executed, and prior statements of a witness were correctly admitted at trial. The court vacated the death sentence upon finding that an informant deliberately elicited incriminating statements from defendant in the absence of his counsel and that such statements were used against defendant at the sentencing hearing in violation of his Sixth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant broke into the home of his estranged wife, deliberately set fire to the house, and repeatedly stabbed his wife. Defendant's wife, their two children, and another child died in the fire. Defendant was convicted of first degree felony murder of the children and second degree murder of his wife. The jury found that aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating circumstances and the trial court sentenced defendant to death for the first degree murders. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and sentence. It was not error for the trial court to fail to instruct the jury on the lesser offense of criminally negligent felony murder, Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 636(a)(6), because a rational jury could not have reached the conclusion that defendant's conduct did not rise to the level of recklessness under the facts of the case. The death sentence was supported by the trial court's deliberate, rational, and logical deductive process and was not disproportionate in relation to similar cases. Even if the defendant did not act with intent to kill, the death sentence was justified because he played a major role in a felony and acted with reckless disregard of human life.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree, possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony, and conspiracy in the first degree. Defendant appealed, contending, inter alia, that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury to disregard a remark by the prosecutor, and that the trial court violated both the ex post facto clause of the federal Constitution and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment when the state death penalty was applied to his pre-enactment offenses. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, holding that the prosecutor's broad remark was improper, but it did not prejudice defendant's rights. The trial court's prompt curative instruction correcting the remark was adequate to cure any potential prejudice. The court held that the amendments to the death penalty statute merely altered the method of determining imposition of the death penalty, and the quantum of punishment for the crime of first-degree murder remained unchanged.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the record reflected that the defendant's decision to enter guilty pleas was the result of advice from and deliberation with his attorney, and the defendant completed a guilty plea form in his own handwriting. The court also found that the defendant was aware of the nature and the elements of the charges against him, and was aware of the implications of pleading guilty to those charges, thus his pleas of guilty were knowingly and voluntarily entered.

The accident was a short distance from the house where the party was being held. The defendant walked his motorcycle to the party and allegedly consumed a pint of alcohol before the police arrived. The defendant was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. The defendant was convicted. On appeal, the defendant contended that a jury instruction was improper. Agreeing with the defendant, the court reversed and remanded. The court said that in a case where the defendant's blood alcohol concentration was over 0.10 percent by weight as shown by chemical analysis of a sample taken within four hours of the alleged offense, 21 Del. C.&sect; 4177(b) stated that the defendant &quot;shall be guilty&quot; of violating 21 Del. C.&sect; 4177(a). The court said that while the jury should be so instructed, the jury must also be instructed in clear terms that they must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was operating a vehicle &quot;while under the influence&quot; of alcohol in violation of 21 Del.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the State's application for leave to appeal was untimely because the controlling statute provided that an application for appeal should be filed with the appellate court within 30 days of the entry of the order appealed from, in accordance with Del.

The State argued that its appeal was timely because it was filed within 30 days of the date on which defendant was sentenced. The court ruled that the State's application for leave to appeal was timely. The court held that regardless of whether the appeal was as a matter of right or was a discretionary appeal, the appeal was to be filed within 30 days of the final order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he was improperly tried and sentenced under former 16 Del. C.&sect; 4751. The court disagreed, holding that the amended 16 Del. C.&sect; 4751 applied only to offenses which occurred on or after June 30, 1990. Defendant was correctly tried and sentenced under the old &sect; 4751 because he committed his offense before June 30, 1990. The fact that the legislature amended &sect; 4751 did not make the former version unconstitutional. Defendant waived his right to claim ineffective assistance of counsel under Superior Court Criminal Rule 61(i)(3) because he failed to raise such claim at trial or on direct appeal and he failed to show cause for relief from the procedural default and prejudice from a violation of his rights. Defendant's claim that the evidence against him was insufficient to support his conviction was barred as having been formerly adjudicated under Superior Court Criminal Rule 61(i)(4) and did not need to be heard in the post-conviction proceeding. As the issues on appeal were clearly controlled by settled Delaware law, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of Delaware held that the bank employees were properly served under Delaware's long arm statute,&nbsp;Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 3104, but that subjecting them to the jurisdiction of the courts did not comport with due process. The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal the court held that the bank employees were properly subject to the jurisdiction of Delaware state courts. Although the bank employee did not actively participate in giving the alleged false advice to the corporation regarding the offering price to acquire stock, the adviser's acts in Delaware were attributable to the bank employees pursuant to the &quot;through an agent&quot; language of &sect; 3104(c). The trial court's error was that it focused too narrowly on the adviser's acts rather than viewing the conspiratorial activities of the bank employee as a whole. The bank employees had reason to know that when it was selling the stock of the company to be acquired on behalf of itself, the adviser and its managed accounts, that the corporation was the acquiring company. That conscious decision to sell consummated the theft of the corporation's inside information. Clearly, the bank employees knew, or had reason to know, that such a misappropriation had an effect in Delaware by its impact on a Delaware company with its principal place of business in that state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's grant of the bank employees' motion to dismiss and remanded for trial.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the petition as untimely, and the court affirmed. The court held that the limitations period in Super. Ct. Crim. R. 61(i)(1) did not deprive a prisoner of his due process right to pursue postconviction remedies. Furthermore, defendant's conclusory allegation of a violation of equal protection of the laws was not persuasive. The court held that defendant's guilty plea constituted a waiver of defendant's claim that the indictment failed to state an offense. Although defendant challenged the sufficiency of the indictment, his claim did not amount to a challenge to the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court. Defendant's petition failed to establish a colorable claim that there was a miscarriage of justice. His only allegation of a constitutional violation was a conclusory assertion that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. He made no effort to establish how his attorney's alleged failings undermined the reliability of his convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner pled guilty to assault and possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for the assault offense and to a mandatory minimum five year sentence for the weapon offense to be served following the underlying sentence for assault. The department had a longstanding practice of &quot;administratively realigning&quot; prisoners' sentences for purposes of calculating parole eligibility dates and conditional release dates based on good time credits. The superior court ruled that an addendum to the regulations of the department of corrections incorrectly repealed the earlier administrative regulation as contrary to state statutory law. On appeal, the department contended that the superior court's ruling was fundamentally flawed in viewing the statute as ambiguous when its literal meaning is clear and compelling. The court held that the trial court's judgment was proper. The department's parole eligibility regulation was adopted by the silence of the legislature, and implicitly by prosecutors, defense lawyers, and judges throughout the state in the negotiation of guilty pleas.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The associate judge asserted that he was denied procedural due process because the court did not give him adequate notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard prior to the issuance of sua sponte orders expediting the proceedings.

It was within the court's authority to modify or supercede its rules in order to expedite a judicial disciplinary matter. The associate judge failed to show that the expedited proceedings caused him actual and substantial prejudice. The court also concluded that the associate judge's conscious refusal to attend the hearing before the Preliminary Investigatory committee (committee) allegedly because his appearance would result in an influx of news media and would not be confidential, constituted a waiver of his right to be heard before the committee.

The court upheld the trial court's judgment and held that defendants were not required to support their motions with medical expert affidavits that they had conformed to the community's standard of care. Plaintiffs admitted that their proposed experts were not familiar with the standard of care in the community where the treatment occurred. The record reflected that, following an adequate time to conduct discovery, plaintiffs were unable to present competent expert testimony to support their allegations. Therefore, defendants were not required to submit affidavits that they conformed to the requisite standard of care. The court refused to consider plaintiff's allegations challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 6853. The issue was not raised in the superior court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the conduct of undercover police officers during their investigation was &quot;so outrageous&quot; as to justify the dismissal of the charges against him; that the State violated the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (IAD), 11 Del. C. &sect; 2544(c), in not bringing him to trial in 135 days; that the trial court erred in admitting evidence, in denying defendant's motion to require the State to reveal the identity of a confidential informant, and in charging the jury; that he had ineffective assistance of counsel; and that 16 Del. C. &sect; 4752 was unconstitutional as it applied to him. The court held that all of defendant's allegations either lacked merit or that the court could not review them because the issues were not raised in the trial court and were raised for the first time on direct appeal. The court further held that the 135-day limit under the IAD was properly extended to resolve matters raised by defendant. The court held that defendant was not entitled to disclosure of the confidential informant because the informant's testimony would not have aided defendant's defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal defendant, a nurse's aide, unsuccessfully challenged her convictions for patient abuse and conspiracy. She was convicted of verbally abusing a wheelchair-bound long-term care patient in the patient's room. At trial, the prosecution was permitted to amend the indictment to add the mens rea required by statute, on which evidence of the patient's condition was admitted into evidence, along with the fact that other person originally charged had pled guilty. Defendant claimed these rulings constituted prejudicial error but the court on appeal disagreed. It found no error at all as to the first two rulings and harmless error as to the third. In addition, it rejected the overbreadth and vagueness challenges to the patient abuse statute, finding that the government could legally bar offensive speech in the patient's room since that was tantamount to her home and that defendant's conduct was plainly of the sort prohibited by the patient abuse statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction was affirmed. The prosecution was properly permitted to amend the indictment to assert the mens rea mandated by statute, any errors in the admission of evidence were harmless, and the patient abuse statute was neither overbroad nor impermissibly vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance and conspiracy in the second degree, he appealed. The court affirmed. Sufficient evidence existed from which the jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that he was engaged in a conspiracy to sell narcotics and that he had narcotics in his possession because he intended to sell them. The superior court carefully considered arguments for and against the admission of a co-conspirator's guilty plea. The record did not reflect that the superior court abused its discretion in denying defendant's request to introduce evidence of the co-conspirator's guilty plea. The record failed to support defendant's argument that there was a systematic over-inclusion of teachers on his jury panel. Defendant did not provide a sufficient record to review his challenge to the array of the jury venire. Therefore, that challenge could not prevail on appeal. The jury manager continued the practice of reassigning teachers during the school year with the implicit approval of the superior court. The decision was clearly within the superior court's discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers stopped the vehicle in which defendant was riding after a surveillance team operating in an area notorious for drug trafficking observed defendant and her companions park the car, which had Delaware license plates, in a deserted place in the area, approach a man, enter a house, and exit 10 minutes later. After the officers asked the occupants to exit the car, they conducted a pat-down search of defendant's companions and found drugs. The officers then arrested defendant and the others. Defendant was not patted down until she got to the station because no female police officer was present on the scene. The search of defendant showed that she had drugs. An officer testified that every car with out-of-state license plates that was stopped after leaving the area, which was in Pennsylvania, and whose occupants had engaged in activity commensurate with drug dealing, was found to be carrying illegal drugs. On appeal, the court held that under the circumstances, the officers had reasonable suspicion to stop the car and conduct a limited search of the occupants.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his drug convictions, but the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the cocaine found in a search of defendant's person was properly admitted at trial and that the trial court correctly denied defendant's motion to suppress. Police were authorized under 11 Del. C.&sect; 1902 to detain defendant for identification purposes because they had reasonable ground to suspect that defendant had committed a crime. The court rejected defendant's complaint that the jury charge was inadequate because the charge did not state that knowledge of the quantity of cocaine was an element of the crime of trafficking. Knowledge of the amount of cocaine a person was carrying was not an element of 16 Del. C.&sect; 4753A. The trial court did not have to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of simple possession because there was no rational basis in the evidence on which to base a verdict of guilty to the lesser offense. The court rejected the argument that &sect; 4753A was unconstitutional because its imposition of a three-year minimum mandatory prison sentence for trafficking in cocaine was not cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, in and for New Castle County, which convicted him of burglary in the second degree in violation of 11 Del.C.&sect; 825 and sentenced him as an habitual offender pursuant to 11 Del.C.&sect; 4214(b) and sentenced him to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the superior court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a continuance and thereby deprived him of effective assistance of counsel. He further contended that the Delaware habitual offender statute,&nbsp;11 Del.C.&sect; 4214, as applied, imposed an unconstitutionally disproportionate sentence in violation of the prohibition against &quot;cruel and unusual punishments&quot; contained in the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court affirmed the judgment. The court would not overrule the denial of the request for a continuance based on ineffective assistance of counsel because the denial was not clearly unreasonable or capricious. Defendant first voiced his dissatisfaction with his attorney on the morning his trial was scheduled to begin. Furthermore, such a claim would not be considered on direct appeal because a full evidentiary record had not been developed below. As to the habitual offender statute, the court held that there was no constitutional defect in the superior court's application of it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was living at the home of the parents of two young girls. The parents left him with the girls while they went out. The State claimed that defendant touched the girls inappropriately and threatened to hurt the older girl if she told anyone what happened. The older girl told a teacher and the school contacted the parents. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in barring evidence of the older girl's prior sexual abuse based on the Delaware rape shield law. Defendant argued that the girl's knowledge of sexual abuse was based on the prior incident. The court held that the trial court properly excluded the evidence. Defendant did not follow the procedure required before introduction of evidence of prior sexual conduct under 11 Del. C.&sect; 3508(a). Further, his oral offer of proof was factually insufficient. The physical evidence showed that the girl had been recently abused and the prior incident was too remote. In addition, Delaware Rule of Evidence 403 authorized exclusion because the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of confusion. Exclusion did not violate defendant's right of confrontation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for Kent County, which upon a jury finding of &quot;guilty but mentally ill&quot; under Del.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A victim was stabbed twice in the heart and struck several times on the head with a blunt instrument. The victim's wallet was found in a search of defendant's residence. Defendant was charged with murder in the first degree and other crimes. The jury found that defendant suffered from a psychiatric disorder but was not insane at the time of the offenses. Accordingly, the jury rendered a verdict of &quot;guilty but mentally ill.&quot; The same jury recommended that defendant be sentenced to death. The superior court convicted defendant and sentenced him to death. On appeal, defendant and amicus curiae on his behalf urged several grounds for reversal of defendant's conviction, but the court found no merit in any of those challenges. However, the court ruled that a new penalty hearing was required. In ruling that a defendant who was found to be &quot;guilty but mentally ill&quot; under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 401(b), could be sentenced to death, the court concluded that the jury's verdict of &quot;guilty but mentally ill&quot; established a mitigating factor as a matter of law, and the failure of the superior court to instruct the jury to that effect was plain error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the superior court that convicted defendant of murder in the first degree, robbery in the first degree, and possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's indemnification claim had its origin in a workers' compensation award received by an employee who suffered two work-related injuries when covered by two separate insurers. The superior court denied plaintiff's request for indemnification or contribution. On appeal, the court affirmed the superior court's judgment. The court held that plaintiff's claim for indemnification or contribution was precluded by the last injurious exposure rule. While plaintiff's claim for indemnification or contribution was not barred under the principle of res judicata, the United States and Delaware Constitutions did not require the allowance of actions for indemnification or contribution in the context of an underlying workers' compensation dispute. The court concluded that indemnification or contribution was not constitutionally mandated. Because plaintiff did not challenge the constitutionality of Del. Code tit. 19, &sect; 2327, the doctrine of res judicata could not be raised as a bar. The court found that the last injurious exposure rule was rationally related to the permissible governmental goal of providing efficiency and certainty in the settlement of workers' compensation claims.</SPAN></P>

In so holding, the court adopted a general rule of non-retroactivity for cases on collateral review. The court also found that a knife found as a result of the taped statement was properly admitted into evidence at trial. The court determined that a bayonet found in defendant's home following the murders was properly admitted into evidence at trial and did not violate defendant's his right to privacy. The court held that the jury was not instructed in unconstitutionally vague terms at the penalty phase of his trial in violation of defendant's right to due process of law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of various narcotics offenses. He was sentenced to a prison term of 18 years and probation for 20 years. Subsequently, defendant moved to be resentenced under the Truth in Sentencing Act of Delaware, 67 Del. Laws ch. 130. The superior court denied defendant's motion, and defendant appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that, because the Truth in Sentencing Act was never intended by the general assembly to have a retroactive effect, defendant's motion for post-conviction relief did not fall within an exception to Super. Ct. Crim. 61, which required a defendant to file a motion for post-conviction relief within three years of the date of his or her conviction. Further, although the Truth in Sentencing Act had the effect of creating a dual system of sentencing in that prisoners convicted of the same crime were sentenced differently depending on whether the crime was committed before or after June 30, 1990, there was a rational basis for the general assembly's enactment of such legislation. As such, defendant had no federal constitutional right to a modification or reduction of his sentence as a matter of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment by the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, in and for Kent County, which entered a jury verdict finding him guilty on 13 counts, including four counts of murder in the first degree, and which sentenced defendant pursuant to the jury's recommendation of death by lethal injection for the murder convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was convicted on 13 counts, including four counts of murder in the first degree, and sentenced to death, raised numerous arguments on appeal, which the court rejected. First, the court held that the trial court had authority to rule on defendant's motion in limine to preclude evidence about the Aryan Brotherhood, to which defendant belonged, at any time before evidence was offered, and not merely before trial began. Second, the court held that the trial court properly denied changing venue because routine pretrial publicity did not justify a change. Third, the court held that voir dire of the jury was proper and afforded defendant a fair trial. Also, defendant was afforded the mandatory 20 peremptory challenges set forth in Del Super. Ct. R Crim. P. 24(b). Fourth, the court held that there was no error in the trial court's admission of evidence of other crimes associated with the murders because their probative value outweighed any prejudice. Fifth, the court held that the prosecutor did not abuse his discretion in seeking capital punishment and that the evidence admitted at the sentencing hearing was necessary for the jury to make an appropriate determination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States District Court for the District of Delaware certified to the court two questions of law that were raised in a suit filed by plaintiffs, a store owner and its principal, against defendants, the Commission on Adult Entertainment Establishments of the State of Delaware, the Attorney General of the State of Delaware, and the State of Delaware, after the store owner's license to maintain coin-operated live entertainment was revoked.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner sought injunctive relief after a license to maintain coin-operated live entertainment was revoked for violation of &sect; 1617 of Delaware's Adult Entertainment Establishments Act, 24 Del. C. &sect; 1601-29. The trial court certified questions to the court. First, could the former holder of a license to operate an adult entertainment establishment whose license had been revoked under 24 Del. C. &sect; 1617 be granted a new license on following the application procedure in 24 Del. C. &sect; 1613? Second, if the answer was yes, did the Act require a waiting period after revocation of a license under 24 Del. C. &sect; 1617 during which the former licensee could not be given a new license, and how long was the waiting period? The court held the following: (1) the requirements for accepting certification had not been met under Rule 41(b) of the Supreme Court of Delaware; (2) the issues between the parties were not joined or ripe for decision; and (3) the impasse in the litigation appeared to be the result of protracted inaction by the Commission, which could be attributable to the failure of the Attorney General to advise the Commission on its responsibilities under and the Act and case law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court refused certification of the questions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employee sought review of a decision of the Superior Court for Kent County (Delaware), which awarded him nominal damages as a result of his improper discharge from his employment with the state police. Defendants, state, Secretary of the Delaware Department of Public Safety, and Superintendent of the Division of State Police of the Delaware Department of Public Safety, also sought review of one of the superior court's rulings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former employee was terminated by the superintendent on March 19, 1984, for violations of the applicable ethics and rules code. The former employee then appealed his discharge to the secretary, who upheld the former employee's termination on November 22, 1985. After the superior court held that the superintendent's termination of the former employee was unlawful under Del. Code Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 8203(6), the former employee filed a complaint against defendants in the superior court. The former employee's complaint alleged a breach of his employment contract and that he was entitled to back pay under Del. Code Ann. tit. 19, ch. 11. The superior court held that although the former employee's claim was filed within the applicable statute of limitations, he was entitled to only nominal damages resulting from the discharge. The court affirmed the superior court's denial of defendants' motion to dismiss, but reversed the superior court's award of nominal damages to the former employee. The court held in part that the former employee was entitled to lost wages, as the secretary was the only person with authority to terminate the former employee under Del. Code Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 8203(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the superior court's denial of defendants' motion to dismiss the former employee's complaint under the applicable statute of limitations. The court reversed the superior court's judgment that limited the former employee's award to nominal damages and remanded the case to the superior court for the entry of an award in favor of the former employee for actual damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County entered an order directing the prothonotary to keep confidential the names of prospective jurors in defendant's highly publicized first degree murder trial. Appellant news media intervened and moved to vacate the order on constitutional grounds. The trial court denied that motion, and the news media appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the news media claimed that, although they were not excluded from the courtroom at any stage of the proceedings, including jury voir dire and selection, the order requiring court personnel to keep jurors' names confidential was a partial closure of the trial. The news media argued they had a qualified First Amendment right of access to the announcement of jurors' names and that the trial court erred by not holding a proper hearing on their motion to vacate. The appellate court held that the news media had no qualified First Amendment right of access to the announcement of jurors' names. In so holding, the court recognized the trial court's affirmative duty to limit outside influences on juries. The court further held that the news media had failed to satisfy the two-part threshold test which required them to show that the announcement of jurors' names had traditionally been open to the press and general public and that public access to jurors' names played a significant positive role in the jury selection process. Because no qualified First Amendment right of access existed, the trial court's failure to conduct a hearing did not mandate reversal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 6537(b) was unconstitutionally applied to the prisoners. The prisoners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoners were serving sentences for Class A and B sexual felonies committed in 1982 and 1978. Del.

The two prisoners had previously been allowed home furloughs and work release. The attorney general determined that the statute applied to prisoners whose offenses pre-dated the statute's enactment and prisoners whose sentences were less that 10 years. The prisoners alleged that the application of the statute to them violated the ex post facto and substantive due process clauses of the United States Constitution. The court affirmed the trial court and held that the trial court was required to apply the literal meaning of the words of the statute and that the statute was not ambiguous or unconstitutional as applied to the prisoners. Because the statute did not change the prisoners' sentence or punishment, it did not violate the ex post facto provisions of the United States Constitution. The prisoners' confinement to a secured institution did not violate the due process clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The division, on the mother's behalf, filed a petition for nonsupport of the child. The father petitioned for de novo review by the family court of the master's order; and, following an evidentiary hearing, the family court found the Melson Formula, including the SOLA, to be applicable and upheld the amount of the master's support award as appropriate. On appeal, the father argued that the application of the SOLA section was contrary to Del. Code Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 514(2) because the parties were not &quot;living under the same roof;&quot; and that the trial court abused its discretion either in not finding application of the Melson Formula to be rebutted by the operative facts or in setting an excessive sum under the circumstances. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that the inability of the trier of fact to find a &quot;familial&quot; or marital standard of living of the parties was not essential for the child to be entitled to SOLA based on a higher standard of living of a more affluent noncustodial parent. The court held that the father had failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that application of the Melson Formula was inequitable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court observed that, absent an expressed provision to the contrary, the laws of intestacy in effect at the time the trust was created controlled for purposes of determining who were &quot;issue&quot; under the provisions of the trust. The court found that, pursuant to the intestacy statutes in effect at the time the settlor established the trusts, Del. Code Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 508 (1987), illegitimates could inherit from their father if the parents married before or after the child was born or if the paternity of the father was established by adjudication before the death of the father or was established thereafter by a preponderance of the evidence. This result applied to two of the three trusts in question. The court found that the law of Quebec, applicable to a third trust that was created in Montreal, also provided that if a child could prove paternity under the law of the father's domicile that child could take under a trust established by the father. Thus, the illegitimate children of the settlor could take under any of the three trusts if paternity were acknowledged or could be appropriately proven.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bureau filed an action for the termination of the mother's parental rights to her three young children. The children had been in foster care for nearly two years, having been removed from their mother's custody due to her mental illness. Two reunification plans were attempted but they were not successful. The trial court ordered the termination of the mother's parental rights. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that Del. Code Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 1103(5) was constitutional, even though it did not define the terms &quot;plan&quot; or &quot;adequately,&quot; because those were ordinary terms that were commonly used and understood. The children were exposed to actual harm by virtue of being in foster care for an extended period of time. The bureau twice attempted to reunify the children with their mother, under plans that called for the children to live with her and for the children to live with the mother's relatives, but neither was successful. Given the mother's chronic schizophrenia diagnosis and her inability to adequately take care of her children, the court held that termination was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant broker-dealer sought review of the decision of the New Castle County Court of Chancery (Delaware), which upheld a two year suspension imposed upon the broker by appellee Securities Commissioner of Delaware (commissioner) under the provisions of the Delaware Securities Act (the Act), Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, &sect;&sect; 7301-28 even though the Chancellor rejected four of the five substantive violations found by the commissioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the chancellor's determination that the broker's misleading reporting of an injunction was a statutory basis under Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, &sect; 7316(a)(4) for the imposition of administrative discipline. The court found that the general designation of &quot;State of Wisconsin&quot; as the issuing authority of an &quot;order&quot; conveyed the impression that an administrative order was involved. Considering the distinction between administrative orders and court-issued injunctions in Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, &sect;&sect; 7316(a)(4), 7316(a)(6), the misleading statement was a significant failure to comply with the Act's reporting requirement. The court found that the broker-dealer failed to show that it was deprived of due process by the mere prosecution of the case by one Deputy Attorney General before another Deputy Attorney General acting in an adjudicative capacity in the absence of specific evidence of bias. The court concluded that the chancellor erred in affirming the two year suspension, which was predicated on five specific violations, while sustaining only one substantive violation without explaining why the sanction was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the chancellor's determination that the broker's misleading reporting of an injunction was a statutory basis for the imposition of administrative discipline under the Act, reversed the approval of a two year suspension, and remanded for a determination of the appropriateness of the two year suspension in the light of the single sustainable violation of the Act and the required protection of the public interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant murdered his pregnant girlfriend. He pleaded guilty to first degree murder. His motion for postconviction relief alleged that the attorney failed to clearly and fully explain to him the nature and consequences of having a trial and the nature and consequences of entering his guilty plea. Defendant contended that his attorney failed to make an adequate factual investigation, in particular, with respect to the evidence surrounding the possible defense of extreme emotional distress. He also claimed that the attorney failed to apprise him of the pertinent law which precluded the imposition of multiple punishment for a weapon offense and an underlying felony. In affirming the judgment, the court held that the trial judge properly found that defendant failed to show prejudice, because he did not show that but for the alleged ineffectiveness of his counsel, he would not have pled guilty to murder in the first degree in order to obtain the benefit of the State's agreement not to pursue the death penalty. The court also found no prosecutorial abuse in the decision to charge first degree murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought the double derivative suit against defendants alleging that they breached their fiduciary duties to the corporation's shareholders. The lower court dismissed the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. On appeal, the court reversed in part and affirmed in part. The court reversed the decision to dismiss the complaint as to defendant corporation, concluding that the lower court erred as a matter of law when it determined that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the corporation. The court noted that defendant corporation consented to the general jurisdiction of Delaware courts when it registered to do business and appointed an agent in the state to receive service of process. Alternatively, the court held that the ownership of a Delaware corporation by defendant corporation, whose alleged mismanagement was the subject of the double derivative suit, constituted a &quot;minimum contact&quot; with the state which satisfied due process and enabled state courts to exercise specific personal jurisdiction over the corporation. The court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint as to the individual nonresident defendants who were not directors of the subsidiary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for trafficking in cocaine and possession of drug paraphernalia and the court affirmed the convictions. Defendant's first argument was that the trial court erred when it declined to suppress defendant's confession. He argued that his confession was induced by promises made by the police officer who interrogated him. Furthermore, he contended that he was under the influence of cocaine when he gave the confession. The court stated that there was no indication that defendant's will was overborne by self-induced intoxication or police promises of leniency. There was clearly sufficient evidence of record that supported the trial judge's conclusion that defendant's statement to the police was voluntary. The court found no error in the trial court's failure to evaluate an alternate theory for the admissibility of testimony relating to defendant's drug addiction because the theory was not raised at trial. Defense counsel's failure to object when the witness read from the transcript prevented the trial judge from determining whether the witness had in fact read from the transcript and from taking corrective measures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his convictions by the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, in and for New Castle County for second degree burglary, and misdemeanor theft violations of Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 825 and 841 (1987) and his sentence as a habitual offender under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4214(b). Defendant claimed that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions and that his sentence violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted for burglary and theft based solely on circumstantial evidence that was also consistent with his innocence. The trial court imposed a sentence of life without the possibility of parole under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4214(b) (1987) because defendant had two previous convictions for daytime burglary. Defendant claimed that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions and that the sentence was disproportionate and unconstitutional because the crimes he committed were nonviolent. On appeal, the court disagreed and affirmed, holding first that the evidence, although circumstantial, viewed in its entirety and including all reasonable inferences, was sufficient to have enabled a jury to find that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also held that the sentence of life without parole was proper because daytime burglary was a serious offense that involved a threat to human life, the recidivist statute only permitted such a sentence where the crimes involved danger to human life or death and even though the sentence differed from those for similar crimes in other states, the sentence was proportionate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff applicants were denied permits to open video stores by defendant town planning and zoning board. The applicants filed an action in the United States District Court of Delaware, which certified a question of law on the issue of whether a business establishment which rented or sold x-rated video cassettes was an &quot;adult entertainment establishment&quot; as defined by Del. Code Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 1602.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants filed an action in the district court against defendants, the town, the town commission and officers, the planning and zoning board and members, and the city building inspector. The district court certified two questions to the court, which considered only whether a business establishment which rented or sold x-rated video cassettes was an &quot;adult entertainment establishment&quot; as defined by &sect; 1602. The court held that, in light of the clear legislative intent expressed in &sect; 1601 and the constitutional entanglement implicit in the inclusion of video rental stores within the scope of &sect; 1602, a business which rented or sold x-rated videos was not per se an &quot;adult entertainment establishment.&quot; The court found that it was the general assembly's intent to limit enforcement of the statute to those businesses likely to facilitate the crimes of obscenity and prostitution. The court also held that a sufficient level of ambiguity existed as to whether the applicants' video store fell within the scope of the statute. To preserve the statute's constitutionality, it was necessary to limit enforcement of the statute to the furtherance of its stated purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff shareholders of defendant Delaware corporation sought to enjoin or rescind a reorganization under which defendant became a majority owned subsidiary of a Panamanian corporation and owned approximately 10 percent of the parent corporation's common stock. The trial court granted partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs, and defendant appealed. The court held that a change in circumstances which technically rendered the appeal moot did not prevent the court from deciding the issue where it was of public importance and its impact on the law was real. The court held that defendant could vote the shares it held in the parent corporation under Panamanian law, even though Panamanian law did not expressly permit that action. The court held that Delaware conflicts law, due process, and the commerce clause mandated application of the internal affairs doctrine, under which Panamanian law governed the issue. The court held that public policy did not mandate the application of Delaware law to the issue. The judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Superior Court in and for Sussex County (Delaware), which, after a jury trial, convicted defendant of two counts of murder in the first degree, robbery in the first degree, and possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony, and that sentenced defendant to death for each murder conviction and to 30 years each for the other counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of and sentenced for two counts of first-degree murder, first-degree robbery, and possession of a deadly weapon in the commission of a felony. The court affirmed. The trial court did not abuse its discretion or commit reversible error by failing to excuse two jurors who initially gave an affirmative response when asked whether they would automatically vote for the death penalty for a person convicted of first degree murder. The trial court properly exercised its judgment and concluded that their views on capital punishment would not substantially impair their performance as jurors. Moreover, defendant failed to establish actual prejudice. The trial court's decision to admit evidence under the inevitable discovery exception was fairly supported by the record and was not clearly erroneous. Defendant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of death by hanging because the statute allowed him the choice of execution by lethal injection. Death by hanging was not cruel and unusual punishment. The prosecutor's comments during rebuttal were not so prejudicial that they constituted plain error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant broke into the victim's home and repeatedly raped her while under the influence of drugs and alcohol, which he voluntarily consumed. The state brought a motion in limine requesting that defendant be barred from introducing psychiatric evidence or any evidence relating to the effects of the voluntary intoxication, claiming that it was no defense under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 421. The trial court barred expert testimony concerning defendant's ability to form the requisite intent to commit the charged offenses, due to voluntary intoxication. Defendant was convicted of rape, attempted rape, kidnapping, and robbery. Defendant appealed, challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 421. On appeal, the court affirmed, ruling that the trial court properly excluded the evidence of defendant's intoxication relating to whether he had the requisite intent. Section 421 was enacted to eliminate the defense of voluntary intoxication to all crimes defined under the criminal code, whether committed intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly. Thus, defendant's intoxication could not be used as a basis for finding that he lacked the requisite intent to commit the crimes of which he was convicted.</SPAN></P>

The superior court held that the injury victim's parents' claim against the manufacturer and the city's claim against the designer were barred by the Delaware Builder's Statute,&nbsp;Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 8127.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injury victim's parents filed an action against the manufacturer and the city after their minor child was injured climbing an electric utility pole. The city filed a third-party claim against the designer. The superior court granted summary judgment to the manufacturer and the designer. On appeal, the court upheld &sect; 8127 and found no error in the judgment. The manufacturer constructed the utility pole according to specifications supplied to it by the designer but did not install the pole at the site where the injury occurred. Nevertheless, the manufacturer satisfied &sect; 8217's &quot;furnishing construction&quot; requirement because it fabricated the utility poles delivered to the city. Also, the manufacturer furnished &quot;improvements&quot; to the real property because the utility poles were affixed to land. Further, &sect; 8217 was not unconstitutional. It was not a &quot;special&quot; law prohibited by Del. Const. art. II, &sect; 19 because it did not relate to fences, live stock, ditches, school districts, or roads. It also did not violate Del. Const. art. II, &sect; 16 because all of the provisions related to the bar on actions against those who improved real estate or the structures located thereon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to plaintiff filing a complaint for a mechanics lien against defendants, defendants sought summary judgment asserting that the Delaware Mechanics Lien Statute was unconstitutional in that the authorization of a lien without the opportunity of a prior hearing deprived the owner of his property without procedural due process. The court denied defendants' motion for summary judgment because the imposition of a mechanic's lien did not constitute the taking of a substantial property interest mandating the safeguards of procedural due process. The court also denied partial summary judgment on the ground that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to defendants' performance under a contract. Defendants argued that they were excused from performance under the contract by reason of plaintiff's failure to provide an adequate indemnity bond. Plaintiff in response contended that it had no contractual duty to obtain a new bond, but assuming such obligation, defendants were guilty of a material breach of the contract by its failure to make payments before the new bond would have been required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The directors voted to institute a preferred share purchase rights plan designed to defend the corporation from any hostile takeover. The dissenting director brought suit. The lower court ruled in favor of appellees. On appeal, the court affirmed. Sufficient authority for the plan existed in Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, &sect; 157. The plan did not prevent stockholders from receiving tender offers, and the change to the corporation's structure was less than that resulting from the implementation of other permissible defensive mechanisms. The plan's effect on proxy contests would be minimal. The directors were informed about the plan and adopted it in the good faith belief that it was necessary to protect the corporation. The plan was reasonable in relation to the threat posed. Therefore, the directors were entitled to receive the benefit of the business judgment rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's ruling, finding that the adoption of the plan was within the directors' authority and was a reasonable defensive mechanism adopted in the good faith belief that it was necessary to protect the corporation from coercive acquisition techniques.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions by a jury in the trial court (Delaware) for two counts of intentional murder, two counts of felony murder, one count of first degree robbery, and one count of possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony. Defendant argued that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated due to the admission into evidence of a statement he made during interrogation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence at trial showed that defendant and another stabbed an elderly couple multiple times during the course of a robbery. After defendant was arrested, he was in custody for almost 20 hours and made incriminating statements to the police that placed him at the crime scene. After his initial appearance, a magistrate ordered that he be sent to prison in lieu of bail. The police violated the order and brought him back to the station for further questioning. Defendant made a confession that was admitted at trial. On appeal, the court ruled that defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated during the second interrogation. The court found that the state failed to show that defendant waived his Miranda rights because defendant merely passively responded to police questions. The court, therefore, reversed defendant's intentional murder convictions. The court affirmed defendant's felony murder convictions because the admission of the statements was harmless as to those offenses. The court also ruled that the sentencing jury properly imposed the death penalty because defendant participated in the killing of the victims and was not merely an accomplice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentence as to the felony murder charges. The court also ruled that the imposition of the death penalty was not disproportionate. The court reversed defendant's convictions for intentional murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court (Delaware), which at his second sentencing hearing after remand from the court reimposed the death penalty. Defendant argued in part that it was error to use the same jury more than four years later in the second hearing that heard the tainted evidence in the first hearing without conducting any voir dire as to whether they had been prejudiced by that evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of felony murder, but his first death sentence was overturned. On remand, the trial court used the identical jury that conducted the first hearing and did not permit voir dire to determine whether the tainted evidence heard in the first hearing would prejudice the jury in the second one. The court concluded that this was both an abuse of discretion and manifest legal error. At a minimum, the trial judge should have conducted a voir dire to ensure the jurors could still be fair and impartial. The jury instructions were prejudicially flawed because they did not reflect the provisions of Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4209. They did not clearly instruct the jury on mitigating and aggravating circumstances, the role of those factors in the jury's deliberation, or the jury's option to impose death or life imprisonment. But the court found that the death penalty was not cruel and unusual for a felony murder because defendant actually committed the murder, because it required a &quot;culpable mental state&quot; of recklessness, and because the underlying felony conviction could be an aggravating circumstance in applying the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's death sentence and remanded the case for a new penalty hearing. The court held that the trial court committed prejudicial error in part when it used the same jury to conduct the second sentencing hearing that heard the first sentencing hearing where tainted evidence was introduced and did not conduct a voir dire to determine if the jury was still impartial.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. tit. 11 &sect; 4209(e)(2) relating to felony murder; (3) the trial court did not err in instructing the jury that an aggravating circumstance, murder during commission of a robbery, was established beyond a reasonable doubt by the conviction for felony murder; (4) error in considering an invalid statutory circumstance was harmless; (5) the death penalty is not inherently disproportionate as to felony murder where defendant was also convicted for intentional murder; (6) when selecting the &quot;universe&quot; of cases for proportionality review under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11 &sect; 4209(g)(2)(a), reference to appeal cases representing a sufficient cross section of similar cases was an adequate standard, and the sentence was not disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant failed to object to the voir dire question or challenge the excusal of the ten veniremen, but since the jury elected to recommend life imprisonment over death, defendant's argument of a death-prone jury was moot. Considering all of the evidence of record, a rational trier of fact would have had no basis to find defendant guilty of a reckless killing. It necessarily followed that defendant was not entitled to any instruction on either murder in the second degree or manslaughter. Aside from the irrelevance of the lesser charges for lack of any supporting evidence, any error in a given charge on the lesser offenses was harmless, at best. Defendant's proposed charge, if given, would have misled the jury into abandoning an objective inquiry into the cause of alleged extreme emotional distress. The prosecutor's remarks, individually and collectively, did not constitute reversible error for lack of demonstration of prejudice to defendant. The court held that cumulative punishment for both the weapons offense and the underlying felony did not violate the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

A police officer detained defendant and his accomplices for questioning and searched the suspects and the car for weapons. Defendant was convicted of attempted robbery, conspiracy, assault, and possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony. Defendant was previously convicted of multiple crimes for two prior criminal episodes. The trial court granted the state's motion to sentence defendant as a habitual criminal under &sect; 4214(a) and sentenced defendant to life imprisonment. The court affirmed defendant's convictions, reversed the judgment that he was a habitual criminal, and remanded for resentencing. The court held that defendant was not eligible for habitual offender sentencing under &sect; 4214(a), which required three separate convictions, each successive to the other, with some chance for rehabilitation after each sentencing. Defendant's prior two sets of multiple convictions were not three separate convictions under &sect; 4214(a). The officer's detention and search of defendant was proper under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1902 because it was reasonable and did not exceed the limits of an investigatory stop.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed an ordinance that allowed it to gradually eliminate non-conforming land uses, including the advertising company's billboards, over a three-year period. The trial court held that Del. Code Ann. tit. 22 &sect; 301 et seq. did not confer power upon a municipality to adopt an ordinance that provided for the gradual elimination of nonconforming uses over a period of years (amortization). Even if it did, the trial court held that the city's ordinance was unconstitutional since it provided for a &quot;taking,&quot; in violation of Del. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 7, 8. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the state constitution authorized amortization, and that the power to &quot;regulate and restrict&quot; as applied to zoning matters, included the power, upon reasonable notice, to prohibit some existing uses. Because there was nothing inherently arbitrary or unreasonable in requiring the removal of existing off-sight signs within three years, the court concluded that the ordinance was constitutional. The court remanded the case to determine whether the application of the ordinance would be so unfair or unreasonable to the advertising company as to render its application unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the legislature intended that the offset from unemployment benefits was controlled by the second unnumbered paragraph of Del.

The court followed authorities holding that Social Security payments were deductible from unemployment benefits under the 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3304(a)(15) of the Act.

Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect;&sect; 27 and 41, which instituted new procedures and penalties governing the offense of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bill contained an appropriation of $ 135,000 for the purpose of implementing the new procedures and penalties governing the offense of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. The governor acted upon the bill by approving and signing it, but purported to reduce the appropriation to $ 20,000 &quot;by line item veto.&quot; The court held that under Del. Const. art. III, &sect; 18, the governor lacked the authority to disapprove the appropriation provision of the bill; that the line item veto provisions of Del. Const. art. III, &sect; 18 applied only to appropriation bills as such; that, otherwise, the governor could not approve a bill in part and disapprove it in part; and that therefore the action of the governor, in effect, amounted to a veto of the entire bill, and thus no part of the bill 780 became law. Accordingly, the question presented by the certification of the chancery court and the superior court was answered in effect that the entire bill failed of enactment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action commenced by plaintiff Attorney General regarding the appointment of a Commissioner for the Delaware River and Bay Authority, the court accepted two certified questions. The first question was whether the Governor had the power while the Senate was in recess to appoint the commissioner when defendant holdover appointee still occupied the position. The second question was whether the appointment had expired.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Attorney General filed an information in the nature of a writ of quo warranto alleging that, by the exercise of the constitutional recess appointment power, the Governor ousted the holdover appointee as a commissioner of the authority in favor of another appointee. Two questions were certified to the court pertaining to the validity of the appointment. The court found that the answer was yes as to whether the term of the appointment had ended because the parties agreed that the commission expired at the end of the next session of the Senate. The court determined the case was still ripe for a decision where a question requiring the interpretation of constitutional and statutory provisions still existed. The court held that the Governor did not have the power to appoint the commissioner while the Legislature was in recess because the recess power granted to the Governor under Del. Const. art. II, &sect; 9 was not intended to be exercised for an office occupied by a holdover appointee. The court concluded that the recess power to fill vacancies was not designed to permit appointments on the mere expiration of stated terms.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered no to the question as to whether the Governor had the power while the Senate was in recess to appoint the commissioner when the holdover appointee still occupied the position.

Additionally, the application of the special jury statute, Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 4541, was not violative of Del.

The court partially affirmed and partially reversed the lower court's judgment. The court declined to address the question of whether the purchase of the resident company's stock purchase established minimum contacts or in rem jurisdiction. Instead, the court held that conspiracy jurisdiction applied because the purchaser knowingly and voluntarily participated in the conspiracy with reason to know that the resident company would take essential steps intrastate in furtherance of the conspiracy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent attorney sought judicial review of a disciplinary action taken against him by the Censor Committee of the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware. The Censor Committee recommended the imposition of discipline for violations of Del. Code of Prof'l Responsibility DR 1-102(A)(1), DR 1-102(A)(5) and DR 1-102(A)(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The clients' security trust fund (fund) requested that the attorney make his financial records available for a random check, to verify that the attorney's financial records were maintained in accordance with fund's guidelines. The attorney refused to make his books and records available for inspection, seeking to challenge the Interpretive Guideline No. 2 of Del. Code of Prof'l Responsibility D.R. 9-102, the inspection requirements of Del. Sup. Ct. R. 66, and the inspection requirements of the regulations of the fund. The attorney contended that the inspection of his financial records violated his constitutional right of privacy and violated his attorney-client privilege. The court clarified that the attorney was required to comply with the fund and submit his books and records for the random check. Pursuant to the authority of Del. Sup. Ct. R. 66, the fund adopted Regulation IV(13) to set the procedure for random audits. The Interpretive Guideline No. 2 of Del. Code of Prof'l Responsibility D.R. 9-102 provided that the books and records of every Delaware attorney were subject to examination. The attorney did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the records in issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered the attorney to promptly submit his books and records for examination by an accountant selected by the trustees of the clients' security trust fund. The court held that the censor committee wrongfully disciplined the attorney for a good faith submission of the production requirement issue for final judicial decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Delaware Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission (Commission) and appellant distributor one challenged the judgment of the Superior Court (Delaware), which, after the Commission refused to terminate distributor one's franchise with appellee manufacturer one, reversed the Commission and determined that the rule upon which the Commission had relied was in conflict with the governing statute. The rule was therefore invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Distributor one distributed alcoholic beverages of manufacturer one. Manufacturer two acquired manufacturer one. Distributor two acquired distributor one. As a result of the changes, the brand alignment remained the same, but the persons controlling it on each side of the contract were different. Manufacturer two notified the Commission and distributor one that it had decided to terminate its relationship and assign the distribution rights to a Delaware importer of its choice. On distributor one's application, the Commission approved the transfer of distributor one to distributor two. At distributor one's request, the Commission held a factual hearing, on the decision to terminate its franchise. The commission refused to permit the termination. The court found that the appellate issue involved an arguable conflict between the Franchise Security Law, Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, &sect; 2551 et seq., and Del. Alcoholic Bev. Control Comm. R. 46, a rule governing the transfer of a franchise to import alcoholic liquor. The court held that the statute and the rule were compatible but that the rule was not properly applied in the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment reversing the Commission's refusal to terminate distributor one's franchise. The court found no conflict in the statute and rule. The court held that a substantial increase in sales did not amount to the requisite showing of cause to compel a manufacturer to continue a franchise arrangement which it otherwise had a right to terminate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court (Delaware), which convicted him of murder first degree, Del. Code Ann. tit. 11 &sect; 636(a)(2), rape first degree, Del. Code Ann. tit. 11 &sect; 764(1), and burglary first degree, Del. Code Ann. tit. 11 &sect; 826(2), and sentenced him to death and to separate sentences for the convictions for rape and burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree, rape in the first degree, and burglary in the first degree. After he was sentenced to the death penalty and to separate sentences for the convictions of rape and burglary, he appealed. The court reversed the death sentence. A penalty hearing was defective for a failure to meet Del. Code Ann. tit. 11 &sect; 4209(d)(1)(a), which required at least one aggravating circumstance for which to impose the death penalty. The court reserved jurisdiction for his double jeopardy claim for the murder and rape sentences pending a decision by the United States Supreme Court in another case. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence for the burglary conviction. The trial judge acted properly within his discretionary powers in declining to submit defendant's requested questions to the panel and in declining to permit counsel to personally examine prospective jurors. The state established a knowing and intelligent waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to counsel before polygraph testing. A reference to the polygraph examination was properly allowed. Allowing use of a color photograph was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant non-resident corporate directors entered limited appearances to contest jurisdiction under Del.

The court held that requiring defendants to imply consent to the assertion of Delaware in personam jurisdiction over them in actions alleging breach of their fiduciary obligations to the corporation was not unreasonable because the consent requirement served a legitimate state purpose. However, the court also stated that under the terms of &sect; 3114 certain of the defendants should have been dismissed because the statute failed to exercise jurisdiction over them.</SPAN></P>

The court found that &sect; 3104 did apply to parties who were residents at the time of the occurrence giving rise to the litigation, and that there was no need for an amendment extending coverage to residents who subsequently moved, as urged by the doctor. The court considered the Delaware Nonresident Motor Vehicle Operator Statute,&nbsp;Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 3112, which had been amended by &sect; 3113 to extend coverage of that statute to residents who departed from the state subsequent to an accident. The court found that there were differences between the two statutes, and that &sect; 3104 covered residents who subsequently departed because it's intent was to afford state citizens a means of redress against persons not subject to personal service within the state.</SPAN></P>

Upon a pat-down search, the arresting officer discovered that defendant was carrying a butcher knife concealed in the waistband of his pants and covered by his shirt. The trial judge charged the jury with the law pertaining to voluntary and involuntary intoxication, and defendant was convicted on charges of carrying a concealed deadly weapon and possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited person. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that the statutes were not unconstitutionally vague in defining &quot;deadly weapon&quot; because defendant should have reasonably known that carrying a butcher knife concealed in the waistband of his pants constituted carrying a concealed deadly weapon, where deadly weapon included &quot;a knife of any sort.&quot; The court concluded that although the statutes did not prescribe any state of mind as a requisite element, the trial judge properly and adequately charged the jury that intent, knowledge, or recklessness could have been inferred from the surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought suit in strict tort liability to recover damages for negligence and injuries resulting from the explosion of a propane heater. The jury returned verdicts in favor of the defendant manufacturer and rejected plaintiffs' motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (n.o.v.) or new trial. On review, the court determined that the trial court was not in error in refusing to instruct the jury as to strict tort liability because the government intended for the sales provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code to preempt the field. The court further held that it was not error for the court to refuse to instruct the jury with regard to res ipsa loquitur, and the court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting plaintiffs' motion for judgment n.o.v. Finally, the court reversed the award of damages and remanded for a calculation of damages.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied appellant's motion to stay the state action based on a prior federal action and entered a final order against appellant enjoining appellant from pursuing the tender offer in violation of the waiting period required by &sect; 203. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the trial court was correct in denying the motion to stay the state action in favor of the federal action as time was of the essence regarding the temporary restraining order. The court found that the factual record on the matter was insufficient and to have decided a final judgment in favor of either party would have created an inevitable conflict between federal law under S.E.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed her convictions for assault and possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony, contending several errors were committed at trial and the imposition of cumulative sentences was improper. The court affirmed the conviction, concluding the admission of photographic evidence was not an abuse of discretion because it was not unduly prejudicial. The court further concluded that the refusal of testimony about the victim's blood alcohol level was not reversible error when the jury nevertheless heard testimony about the blood alcohol count. The court found that defendant was entitled to the reversal and remand of the sentences because, although multiple prosecutions in violation of double jeopardy did not occur, multiple punishments for the same offense had clearly been imposed. The court explained that the requirements that the state had to prove for the assault and weapons counts were identical: the intentional causing of serious physical injury by means of a deadly weapon. The court observed that in order to obtain a conviction on the weapons offenses, the state had to prove the underlying assault as well as the possession of a deadly weapon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An inn asked the Delaware Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission to issue it a liquor license. The commission told the inn that pursuant to Delaware Alcoholic Beverage Commission Rule 4, it would issue a liquor license if the inn obtained a certification from the city where it was located stating that the license would not violate state zoning laws. The trial court affirmed the commission's decision denying the inn its requested license, and the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found that Delaware Alcoholic Beverage Commission Rule 4 was constitutional and lawful under Del. Const. art. II, &sect; 25 and Del. Code Ann. tit. 22, &sect; 301 because those provisions authorized municipalities to promulgate and administer zoning regulations. Also, the court rejected the argument that permitting the inn to sell alcoholic beverages would have served as a lawful intensification of a valid non-conforming use as a restaurant and hotel, noting that zoning ordinances restricted nonconforming uses and tended to secure the elimination of such uses.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 9902(b), the state appealed as of right a pre-trial ruling of the Superior Court (Delaware), which declared that two statements of a previously-tried co-defendant were inadmissible in defendant's trial for first degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During questioning of co-defendant, police believed that he had knowledge of the murder for which defendant was charged. He initially told police that he had nothing to say, but later gave information about defendant's involvement. He had been charged with an unrelated robbery. At the required hearing on the voluntariness of the statements, co-defendant testified that he gave the statement to the police solely because of promises of freedom and reward. The trial court ruled that co-defendant's statement was not voluntary because it was given based on the officer's inducements. On appeal, the court ruled that although the trial court concluded that the statement was induced by the expectation of freedom and reward, it failed to reach the crucial issue of whether those inducements, under the totality of the circumstances, &quot;overbore&quot; co-defendant's will to resist. The court held that such inducements were material to the issue of the reliability of a statement, and did not render a statement involuntary unless the inducements were so extravagant as to overbear the person's will and rational thinking process. The court remanded to the trial court for reconsideration of this issue.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that if the court reversed its previous ruling, the state's appeal would become moot. The court held that if the trial court reaffirmed its ruling, then the trial court was ordered to submit its reasons to the court for further review.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed defendants' convictions, finding that although nudity alone was insufficient to establish obscenity, this case did not involve mere nudity. The court reasoned that the pictures at issue were a lewd exhibition of genitals, which constitutes hard core sexual conduct that was constitutionally subject to proscription. The court held that the jury properly considered the use of children in the pictures in determining that they were patently offensive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed a medical malpractice action against the doctor alleging that he caused the patient injuries during performance of a laparoscopy. Plaintiffs proposed to introduce the expert testimony of an out-of-state physician, and the parties submitted the question of the physician's competency to testify as an expert witness. The trial court entered a pre-trial order determining that plaintiffs' medical expert was not qualified to testify in support of their claim for damages (direct and derivative). Plaintiffs appealed, and the court affirmed. The court agreed with the trial court that the physician's tangentially acquired knowledge did not establish the familiarity with the state medical practice contemplated by Del. Code Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 6854, that was, knowledge by which to measure the performance of a state surgeon. The court concluded that while its construction of the familiarity requirement of &sect; 6854 was different from the trial court's construction, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to receive the physician's testimony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Senate passed Bill 379 to permit &quot;pool or pari-mutuel&quot; wagering on jai-alai exhibitions, noting that the gambling activity was permissible as a lottery under the state Constitution. Concerned with the bill's constitutionality, the governor submitted three questions to the court. The court addressed the first question, and the majority ruled that the remaining questions were moot. The court found that Del. Const. art. II, &sect; 17 prohibited &quot;all forms of gambling&quot; except those expressly authorized; that any exception to such general constitutional prohibition must be narrowly and strictly construed; that except for on-track pari-mutuel betting authorized by &sect; 17(b), pool-selling was not excepted from the general anti-gambling prohibition of &sect; 17 by any express provision; and that, therefore, all other forms of pari-mutuel betting remained constitutionally banned. Accordingly, the court held that pool or pari-mutuel wagering was not a permissible &quot;lottery&quot; under the Constitution. The court further held that the gambling activities permitted by the bill would not be &quot;under state control&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 17(a).

Code Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 103. Thus, the receipt of the commissions by defendants was not a part of the business of insurance within the meaning of Del.

Among defendant taxpayer's arguments were claims that the Act impermissibly contained multiple subjects not expressed in its title, that the Act violated the state constitution's tax uniformity clause that the Act impermissibly authorized the expenditure of public funds for private purposes, and that the Act impermissibly authorized the appointment of a commission in derogation of the constitutional requirements controlling such appointments. The trial judge certified the matter, and the court, after reviewing each of defendant's contentions, rejected them all. It therefore held that the Delaware Health Facilities Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The certified question was answered in the negative. That is, the Delaware Health Facilities Act was held not to violate each of the cited provisions of the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, state superior court judges, appealed an order from a Court of Chancery (Delaware), which denied them injunctive and monetary relief in their claims brought under Del. Code Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 6532 (C.O.L.A. Law), against defendant state, and held that they were not entitled to cost of living upward adjustments in their salaries, which corresponded to percentage increases in the federal cost of living index.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the judges urged that the definition of &quot;employee&quot; in Del. Code Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 6532(a) included them. The state contended that the judges were excluded from the statutory benefits of COLA because they were &quot;public officers.&quot; After a review of legislative intent and statutory amendments, the court held that all state officers, including the judges, were employees entitled to cost of living increases under the C.O.L.A. Law. Prior to the enactment of the C.O.L.A. Law, the legislator who proposed it was asked to submit an estimate of the financial effect COLA would have, and he included the judges' salaries in his calculation. The court noted that other statutes managing state employees, including Del. Code Ann. tit. 29, &sect;&sect; 6340(a), 5853, 5701(1), held that judges were state employees. Statutory interpretation and legislative history weighed against the Attorney Generals' advisory opinion that judges were not &quot;employees.&quot; Inclusion of the judges and other public officers in the C.O.L.A. Law comported with Del. Const. art. XV, &sect; 4. The court distinguished the treatment of the governor's salary because increases in his salary were prohibited under Del. Const. art. III, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the chancery court, which denied injunctive and monetary relief to judges, holding that they were employees for purposes of the C.O.L.A. Law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11 &sect; 636(a) (2), and rape under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11 &sect; 763. Prior to trial, defendant and the state entered into plea negotiations, and he agreed to plead guilty to second degree murder and rape. Thereafter, the state withdrew its offer and went to trial. Defendant challenged the convictions alleging that he had relied on the state's offer and was, therefore, entitled to specific performance of the plea agreement. The significance of defendant's contention was that under a plea for second degree murder, he would be eligible for parole, but his first degree murder conviction required a life sentence. The court held that because defendant had filed all of his pretrial motions prior to the state's withdrawal of its offer, and the motions were heard, although denied, defendant was not entitled to specific performance where his reliance on the plea offer was not significant. The court, therefore, affirmed defendant's convictions, but remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing to life imprisonment because the death penalty under Del. Code Ann. tit. &sect; 4209(a) had been declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of disorderly conduct and sentenced by a justice of the peace, who was not a lawyer. Defendant appealed to the superior court, which dismissed the appeal. Upon defendant's appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The significant constitutional question was whether the Delaware Justice of the Peace Court system violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by authorizing a non-lawyer judge to preside over a criminal proceeding involving charges which could result in incarceration. The court first held that there was a jurisdictional basis for review because the proceedings were reviewable under the common law writ of certiorari. The Delaware system gave every criminal defendant the unfettered right to elect to be tried in the Court of Common Pleas, as opposed to a Justice of the Peace Court, and the Justice of the Peace was required to advise each defendant of that right before he had jurisdiction to try the case. Because such advisement was not documented in the instant case, and no waiver was conclusively shown, the court reversed. The court further set forth explicit guidelines to analyze such waivers in the future.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the superior court, which had dismissed defendant's appeal of his conviction in a justice of the peace court, and remanded with instructions to reverse defendant's conviction by the justice of the peace. The ruling was to apply only to the instant case, one other case decided the same day, and to any other case then on appeal or in which the trial began after the date of the opinion.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that defendant did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of 11 Del.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Chancery (Delaware), certified a question of law that from an action filed by petitioner State Board of Pension Trustees (board), seeking, as a protective order, instructions that certain statutes enacted by the General Assembly were valid, and that the board and its members could comply with the terms thereof without violating their fiduciary duties to the State Employees' Pension Plan and the State Employees' Retirement Fund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The General Assembly enacted four statutes, 60 Del. Laws 186 and 188, 60 Del. Laws 239, and 60 Del. Laws 214, purporting to grant service, disability, and survivor's pensions to individuals who did not meet the eligibility requirements of the State Employees' Pension Plan (Plan), and to award pension benefits in excess of the amount to which the named pensioners were otherwise entitled. The board sought the court of chancery's approval before acting under the new statutes, and that court certified four questions of law, one of which the court found determinative of the issues. The court found that the statutes in issue unlawfully impaired the contractual rights of former and present state employees (participants in the Plan) in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court held that vested contractual rights existed under the State Pension Law and in the State Pension Fund, and found that the statutes interfered with the statutory vested rights of the Plan participants. The court found that under a contributory plan, pensions were a part of the compensation of an employee to which he was as much entitled as he was to the wages he was paid for the work he performed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified question in law in the affirmative, finding that the statutes in question unlawfully impaired the contractual rights of participants in the State Employees' Pension Plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Intervening defendant record title holder sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court (Delaware), which denied his motion to set aside an order confirming the sale of property to which he held title. Plaintiff mortgagee's foreclosure action by scire facias sur mortgagean pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 5061, had only named defendant grantor, who had conveyed the property, subject to the mortgage, to the record title holder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgagee brought a foreclosure action begun by scire facias sur mortgagean, naming only the grantor as defendant. When she did not appear, the sale was ordered confirmed. The record title holder intervened as defendant and appealed the confirmation order. Upon appeal, the court held that the record title holder was entitled to notice and a hearing before he was deprived of legal title, and that the statute under which the action was brought, Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 5061, was constitutionally deficient. The court held that in the absence of a statutory procedure the trial court should have promptly provided for notice by rule or general order as part of the proceedings. The court held that while the record title holder had a due process right to notice of the foreclosure proceeding and although he should have been named a party at the beginning of the action, it did not follow that dismissal was required. The court concluded that the record title holder was eventually made a party to the action and that nothing that occurred prior to his appearance, including the entry of the default, could be applied against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court denying the record title holder's motion to set aside the sheriff's sale of property to which he held title, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant corporate directors sought review of a decision of a Court of Chancery (Delaware) which denied a motion to dismiss plaintiff stockholders' derivative action that alleged the corporation suffered significant loss and damage as a result of the violation of antitrust laws by the corporate directors and denied a motion to vacate its order of sequestration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporate directors asserted that the lower court lacked jurisdiction over the claim, and that Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 366, the state's sequestration statute, violated their right to due process of law. The court rejected the contention of the corporate directors, finding that jurisdiction was proper because the situs of the ownership of the stocks that were seized was within the state. The court ruled the seizure of the stock was proper because the sequestration statute provided safeguards to the directors' interests in the stock. The court noted that the sequestration procedure was at all times under the control of a judge; the directors had a right to litigate compliance with the statute without appearing generally; if the lower court determined that there was a valid seizure the directors had the right to appear generally; if the directors did so appear they were entitled to release of the property unless the stockholders met the statutory terms; and that the directors were entitled to a hearing to test the reasonableness of the value of the property seized, including the merits of the stockholders' claim to the extent that it was pertinent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the lower court that denied the motions of the corporate directors. The court held that the sequestration statute was not unconstitutional because it balanced the interests between the stockholders and the corporate directors and provided the corporate directors with procedural safeguards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff garbage dump operator challenged the order of the superior court (Delaware), which affirmed an order directing that he cease from operating the dump on the grounds that it was a nuisance under Del Code Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 1703, and denied him damages against defendants, state agencies and HCA Food Corporation (HCA), for breach of contract and wrongful taking of property. The state agencies appealed from an order directing it to pay costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A garbage dump operator challenged the judgment of the superior court, which affirmed orders issued by the state agencies directing that the garbage dump operator cease and desist form the operation of the dump and denied the garbage dump operator's claims against the state agencies and HCA for monetary damages for breach of contract and for the appropriation of his property by the state. With regard to the administrative order to cease and desist, the court affirmed. The dismissal of the claim for monetary damages against the state agencies and HCA was also affirmed, but the order directing the state agencies to pay the costs of litigation was reversed. The court held that the doctrine of sovereign immunity protected the state agencies from the claim for damages, because immunity was not waived by the Del. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, given that the license to operate the dump was not property in any constitutional or legal sense and that the garbage dump operator did not have any property interest in the clam shells hauled to the dump, prior to hauling. The court found that the superior court was unauthorized to require the state agencies to pay the costs of an unsuccessful plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
