</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The illegitimate son of the deceased claimed that he was entitled to a share of his intestate father's estate. The superior court found that the son had not complied with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-19, so he was not entitled to share in the estate. The son appealed and argued that the statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed. The court found that the statute was constitutional because it was substantially related to the lawful state interests it was intended to promote. The statute did not violate the equal protection and due process clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The son contended that the papers he produced, which clearly acknowledged paternity, were sufficient under the statute even though they did not strictly comply with the statute's requirements. The court found that although there was little doubt that the son was the natural son of the deceased, the written documents he offered were executed for purposes other than to establish paternity as contemplated under the statute. Since a father had to act to include an illegitimate child in his estate, strict compliance with the statute was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant inmate sought review of the judgment from the Superior Court, Transylvania County (North Carolina), which granted a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action upon which a relief could be granted to appellee prison officials. The inmate alleged he was deprived of First, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendment rights by the prison officials under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate alleged improper treatment and violations of his rights by the prison officials. The court held that since the inmate had shown no abuse, the court found no violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-110. Since this was a civil action against the prison officials and the state was not a party, the court held that no procedural due process or right to appointed counsel inured to the inmate. The court was not aware of any rule that required a trial judge to order a furlough for an inmate whereby that inmate could assist in a legal dispute. The court held that the intrusions were plausible administrative responses to the prison officials' reasonable perception of security needs. An allegation of verbal abuse by the prison officials did not rise to a claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The inmate alleged being denied sheets, towels, and home cooked food. The court held these discomforts were a function of the detention facility's limited resources. Since none of the inmate's allegations were legally sufficient to state a claim for a deprivation of a constitutional right, or to state any other cognizable claim, the court held that the trial court properly dismissed the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the grant of the prison officials' motion to dismiss the complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicants failed their Bar examinations. They filed an action for a declaratory judgment that &sect; 84-24 affected their fundamental human right to practice law and was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. The applicants appealed the order granting the Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion of the board and officials to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The court affirmed that the applicants were entitled to no relief because they had no unqualified natural or constitutional right to pursue a given calling. The court held that examination of applicants to the Bar was a lawful delegation of legislative authority under N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 that promoted the legislative goal of protecting the public interest by maintaining a competent Bar. The court found that the subjective grading procedures and essay examinations were constitutional and that the failing applicants were afforded due process by the opportunity for reexamination. The court held that the applicants' bare assertion that their failing answers on the bar examination were the same as those written by successful candidates did not state a claim that the board's evaluations were unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The applicability and constitutionality of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-15(c), the North Carolina limitations statute, was raised on appeal. The court held that as the patient did not discover her injury until after &sect; 1-15(c) had become effective, the one-year period provided therein applied. Further, the court found that &sect; 1-15(c) was not void for vagueness, as the law included health providers in its definition of professionals, and was not discriminatory as the patient was not a member of a protected class and the statute met the rational basis test for a constitutional claim of equal protection.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prisoner filed an action to access his mental health records, and the trial court granted the secretary's motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding no statutory, common law, or constitutional right to direct access to the records. The court found that mental health patients' rights did not apply to a prison-operated facility because such prisoners would have rights and privileges not afforded to other prisoners, and prisoners receiving mental health care were covered by rules adopted under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 143B-261.1. The court ruled that there was no common law right to inspect the records because prison records were confidential and not available to the inmate concerned. The court found no denial of equal protection in that prisoners in other treatment facilities were governed by the same rules as in prison-operated facilities. The court found no deprivation of property without due process as there was no property right in mental health records generated in prison. The court found no Eighth Amendment violation because the failure to provide access did not offend standards of decency or result in the infliction of pain.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent mother sought review of a judgment from the District Court, Durham County (North Carolina), which terminated the mother's parental rights and refused to grant the mother's motion to dismiss the petition. The mother contended that the state's witnesses had no first-hand knowledge of the facts in controversy, that the state relied on inadmissible foster care records, and that the state relied on inadmissible prior findings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother's parental rights were terminated by the trial court, and the mother appealed the denial of her motion to dismiss the termination action. The state raised a cross-assignment of error as to the trial court's order providing a copy of the transcript to counsel without cost to the mother. Upon review, the court affirmed the termination of the mother's parental rights and vacated the trial court's order respecting the costs of the transcript. The court determined that the trial court did not use the wrong statute in defining abandonment, under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-517 and that the state offered sufficient evidence to establish grounds for termination of parental rights under both N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-289.32(2), (3). As to the mother's challenges of the admissibility of the testimony offered at trial, the court held that the trial court was correct in recognizing that the case could not be decided in a vacuum and that the procedural and factual history of the case was relevant and necessary to a full and fair determination of the issues. The court concluded that the evidence overwhelmingly pointed to a total absence of family integrity since the children were born.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both defendant sister, sister of the decedent, and plaintiff litigants, illegitimate children of the decedent, challenged a decision from the Superior Court Forsyth County (North Carolina), which reversed the decision of the clerk of the superior court. The superior court declared N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-19(b)(1) to be constitutional. The superior court reversed the clerk's order of removal of the sister as administratrix of the decedent's estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sister applied to the clerk for letters of administration after the death of the decedent in May 1980. In her application, the sister listed decedent's mother as the sole heir and distributee and stated that no children were born to the decedent. After issuance of the letters of administration, the litigants initiated a hearing pursuant to &sect; 28A-9-1. The clerk ordered the sister removed as administratrix based upon the findings that the litigants were the natural children of the decedent and that letters of administration had been issued to the sister due to false representation or mistake. On appeal, the superior court found insufficient evidence to support the finding that the letters had been issued due to false representation. The court affirmed the sister's appeal and reversed the litigants' appeal. The court held: (1) where the sister took no exception to the clerk's finding that the letters were issued by false representation, the issue was not properly before the superior court; (2) the clerk's findings sufficed to support the conclusion that the sister should be removed as administratrix; and (3) the superior court properly concluded &sect; 29-19(b)(1) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the superior court's decision, which found the litigants were entitled to take from the decedent's estate. The court affirmed the finding of constitutionality of the North Carolina General Statute that provided an illegitimate child could take from any person adjudged to be the father of the child was constitutional. The court reversed the decision reversing the clerk's decision to remove the sister as the administratrix.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The program in question was adopted by the school board in an attempt to alleviate the problem of the &quot;latch key&quot; child. The children enrolled in the program stayed at the school in the late afternoon for a fee. Plaintiffs argued that the program violated the uniform system requirement of the North Carolina Constitution. The court disagreed and affirmed the summary judgment. In doing so, the court held that (1) the school board had not violated the constitutional mandate by formulating the program's concept or by allowing it to operate at a particular elementary school, (2) the school board had provided a general and uniform education for the students in the system as required by N.C. Const. art IX, &sect; 2(1), and there was no requirement that it provide identical opportunities to each and every student, and (3) so long as the school board offered tuition free basic education, it satisfied the constitutional mandate that education be free. Because the program was not a part of their regular school day, the students were not being charged for their basic education. Further, there was both constitutional and statutory authority for the school board's involvement with the program.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State sought review of an order from the Mecklenburg County Superior Court (North Carolina) in favor of defendant in a criminal matter. Defendant filed a cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court dismissed the appeal filed by the State for lack of jurisdiction. The State could appeal from a judgment in favor of defendant only if such a right to appeal existed by a statute.&nbsp;N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1445 granted to the State the right to appeal an order allowing a motion to suppress evidence pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-979. Section 15A-979 required the prosecutor to certify to the trial court that the appeal was not taken for purpose of delay and that the evidence was essential to the case. The court held that 15A-979 was to be read in conjunction with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1448(a)(1), which stated that a case remained open for appeal for a period of 10 days after the entry if judgment. The burden was upon the State to show that it had fully complied with the statutory requirements for an appeal, and the State failed to prove that the appropriate certificate was timely filed. Because the State failed to properly perfect its appeal, the court held that the State's appeal was not authorized by statute and the court had no jurisdiction. The court dismissed defendant's cross-appeal because he could only appeal a denial of a motion to suppress after a conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff citizens appealed a judgment of the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina), which, in an action filed against defendants, the Governor of North Carolina and certain state financial officers, found that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 143-28.1, which provided that the Governor should not allow a deficit to occur by failing to balance the state budget, did not violate the North Carolina Constitution providing for a balanced budget.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A number of citizens challenged the constitutionality of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 143-28.1, which provided that the Governor of North Carolina could not, in administering the budget, permit a deficit to be incurred by the State on account of total expenditures exceeding total receipts. The trial court found the statute constitutional, and the citizens appealed. The citizens contended that the incurring of a contractual obligation constituted an expenditure within the meaning of &sect; 143-28.1, that the statute violated N.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 3, which prohibited the General Assembly from contracting debt without voter approval, and that the statute allowed the State to execute void contracts. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, finding that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 143-28.1 did not violate the constitution because an expenditure occurred only when funds were disbursed and not when a contract was made, that the intent of N.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 3 was to restrict the State's power to borrow money and not its power to enter into long-term contracts, and that the citizens' other arguments were without merit.</SPAN></P>

The wife and administrator of the husband's estate (administrator) each filed motions for summary judgment, with the administrator asserting that the wife's claim was barred by the doctrine of laches. The trial court denied the administrator's motion and granted the wife's motion. The administrator sought review of the trial court's decision. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's ruling, holding that the only bar to the wife's enforcement action was the ten-year statute of limitations, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;81-47, which the trial court correctly applied to reduce the wife's monetary claim to the extent it was time-barred. The court also ruled that even assuming that laches was a valid defense to an enforcement action, the administrator could not prevail because he had failed to offer any evidence in support of a laches defense and because a mere lapse of time alone did not bar an action for the enforcement of a child support order.</SPAN></P>

The court further ruled that there was sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption that the child was the legitimate daughter of the mother's husband; that for purposes of N.C. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board of adjustment was empowered to issue special use permits pursuant to &sect; 10-2073.

Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-2073(2)y 1-4. The court found that the owner produced substantial evidence of the facts and conditions required for issuance of the permit, and that no evidence to the contrary was presented. The court ruled that the board's denial of the permit based on the proximity of a tavern and because the board &quot;felt&quot; the bookstore would have been &quot;detrimental to the neighborhood&quot; was improper. The court ruled that the board's interpretation of N.C. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Buncombe County, N.C., Ordinance No. 1640 required, among other things, that junkyards or automobile graveyards should be surrounded by a fence and that vegetation that would reach a height of six feet at maturity should be planted so that a continuous unbroken hedge would exist. Defendant was charged under the ordinance, and he challenged the constitutionality thereof. On appeal from a judgment for defendant, the court held that: (1) Ordinance No. 1640 was not vague because men of common intelligence would know the type of hedge required by it and that he would be required to tend to the hedge in such a manner that it would grow to the required height and thickness in the normal growing period for the type of plants used and would understand that the regulated business might not be placed within a quarter mile of the edge of the school grounds; and (2) although the ordinance regulated for aesthetic purposes only, it did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution or the Law of the Land Clause of the state constitution because the duty placed therein was not too burdensome as compared to the public benefit in improving the appearance of the highways.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The town amended an existing ordinance by removing only restaurants with drive-in service from the list of conditional uses in certain town districts, leaving both restaurants without drive-in service and non-restaurant drive-in businesses as permitted uses in those districts. On appeal, the court held that the amended ordinance was unconstitutional because the amendment effectively precluded construction of restaurants with drive-in service in the entire town. The town amended the ordinance in direct response to plaintiffs' proposed construction of a restaurant with drive-in service after they had obtained a valid conditional use permit. Because the record did not demonstrate any rational relation of the amendment to a legitimate police power objective and because it arbitrarily singled out and rendered impermissible the use proposed by plaintiffs, the amendment contravened established constitutional limitations on exercise of police powers. The town properly enacted a left turn ordinance at a busy intersection within the town to control the flow of traffic where the ordinance rationally related to the to the safety and general welfare of the town's citizens.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review of the trial court's summary judgment for the dentist in the patient's breach of warranty action, the court affirmed, holding that the patient could not remove her action from the effect of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-21.13(d) nor change the essence of her claim by labeling it an action of a different name. The court found that application of &sect; 90-21.13(d) did not violate the patient's constitutional rights, nor could the patient avoid the statute's effect by stating a cause of action under the Uniform Commercial Code, alleging that the transaction constituted a sale of &quot;goods&quot; by a &quot;merchant&quot; and was thus covered by an implied warranty under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 25-2-315. The fact that the dentist held himself out as specializing in the preparing and fitting of dentures did not remove him from the practice of dentistry and transform him into a merchant. The evidence clearly indicated a protracted course of treatment, with numerous adjustments and fittings. Without a doubt, the patient paid for and received a course of health care treatment and services, not merely a piece of merchandise.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant was convicted of armed robbery, kidnapping, second-degree rape, and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill he appealed. On appeal the court held that the failure to hold a probable cause hearing was not a valid ground for dismissal. Before the probable cause hearing was held, four indictments were returned against defendant. The court stated that a probable cause hearing was required only in situations in which no indictment had been returned by a grand jury. Therefore, defendant was not entitled to a probable cause hearing, and, furthermore, defendant failed to show that his case was prejudiced in any way by the failure to hold such hearing. The court also found no error in the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for a state-appointed private investigator. Defendant failed to show that there was a reasonable likelihood that an investigator would have discovered evidence that would have materially assisted him in the preparation of his defense. The court concluded that defendant was not denied his right to a speedy trial because the delay in bringing defendant's case to trial resulted from defendant's own motion for change of venue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dealer contended that N.C. Gen.

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that, in view of the complexities surrounding the sale, dealer servicing, warranties, financing, titling and registration of a motor vehicle, the distribution of motor vehicles was a business which easily could be conducted so as to become a medium of fraud and dishonesty. The court also ruled that the regulation was based upon reasonable grounds and was not arbitrary and was, therefore, a proper exercise of the state's police power. The court also found that the statute did not violate equal protection, because the distinctions made under the law were made on a rational basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended the statute was unconstitutional in that it was a denial of due process because of vagueness, it was a denial of equal protection because of age classification in the statute, and it was an overbroad restriction on protected activity. Defendant asserted that the superior court erred in its charge by instructing the jury that masturbation in the presence of another was an immoral or indecent act within the meaning of the statute. Defendant argued that because the statute used the words &quot;with any child,&quot; there had to be some touching of the child to constitute an indecent liberty under the statute. The court rejected the argument and held that it was not necessary that there was a touching of the child by defendant in order to constitute an indecent liberty within the meaning of &sect; 14-202.1. The purpose of the statute was to give broader protection to children than the prior laws provided, and the word &quot;with&quot; was not limited to mean only a physical touching.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff filed an action against defendants for an unknown cause. The trial court found defendants in contempt of court, apparently for violating a consent judgment as to a permanent injunction. Defendants appealed, arguing that their agreement to restrict their activities in compliance with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 55B and &sect; 89C was null because the statutes were unconstitutional and unenforceable and no contempt could arise for failure to comply with them. The court affirmed, holding that the evidence supported the trial court's findings. The contempt order itself contained a finding that defendants failed to raise questions of constitutionality earlier in the case due to excusable neglect, but the trial court considered them anyway and overruled them. In none of the proceedings did defendants allege that they were induced to enter into the consent order through fraud or mistake or that they did not freely consent to the provisions of that judgment at the time of its entry. The court also held that a consent order was a binding decree and neither a subsequent change in the law or misconstruction of the law at the time of its entry was a ground for setting it aside.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the statute clearly provided that jury selection and argument of counsel had to be recorded upon motion of any party. However, because defendant had not shown prejudice resulting from the denial of his motion, the court found no showing of prejudice. The trial court found that the officers were invited into the trailer and that no credible evidence existed from which to reasonably conclude that a deputy was at any time asked to leave the trailer. The trial court's findings were supported by competent evidence and thus were conclusive on appeal. The court concluded that any seizure of persons in the trailer resulting from the deputy's remaining at the scene while the search warrant was being obtained was reasonable and permissible. No constitutional rights of the trailer's occupants were violated thereby. There was no evidence that defendant's statements were involuntary or were unconstitutionally obtained.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-21 by passing a special legislative act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The purpose of the annexation was to provide urban developed areas with governmental services needed for public health, safety, protection, and welfare. The landowners contended that the special legislative act passed was constitutionally infirm because they would have been wrongfully denied sewer services. The court disagreed, concluding that the special legislative act was not over-reaching, nor was its involvement in the extension of the town's boundaries suspect and deserving of close scrutiny. The court further found there was no infringement of a fundamental right or discrimination on the basis of any suspect classification. The court held that the special legislative act was reasonably related to a valid legislative purpose and that there was no unlawful discrimination as to sewer services. The fact that not all of the town's residents received sewer services and the fact that sewer service could have only been made available to the landowners for a fee did not invalidate the special legislative act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commission disciplined the attorney under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 84-28 (amended 1975) for his conduct related to an evidentiary matter in a case in which he represented one of the parties. The court affirmed and found that &sect; 84-28, as amended, applied because he asserted as much in his response to the commission's consolidation motion, and application of the amended version to his attorney disciplinary proceeding did not constitute an ex post facto application of the law. Section 84-28, as amended, did not violate due process because it did not interfere with his right to practice law and the legislature could affect procedure retroactively, for there was no vested right in procedure. The court ruled that applying the amended version of &sect; 84-28, which did not provide for trial by jury, did not deprive him of his right to a jury trial and held that the right to a jury trial in the disciplinary proceeding depended on the controlling statute. If he had such a right, he waived it by failing to assert it during the proceeding. It was not an abuse of discretion for the commission to consolidate under N.C. State Bar R. art.

Stat. &sect; 14-71.1 (1979), the elements of feloniously possessing stolen property were: (1) possession of personal property; (2) valued at more than $ 400; (3) which had been stolen; (4) possessor knew that property was stolen; and (5) possessor acted with dishonest purpose. Under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;14-72(a) (1979), the elements of felonious larceny were: (1) defendant took property belonging to another; (2) carried property away; (3) without owner's consent; (4) with intent to deprive permanently; (5) defendant knew he was not entitled to property; and (6) property valued at more than $ 400.

The contractors sought review of an order of the Superior Court of Catawba County (North Carolina), which dismissed their compulsory counterclaims, stating that the contractors were entitled to enforce the contract defensively, as a set-off, to the claim asserted against them by the homeowners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The homeowners claimed that the contractors were barred from any recovery of damages for breach of contract or under the theory of quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The trial court, at the parties' request, conducted a trial on that issue, prior to a full trial on the merits. Because the judgment affected a substantial right of the contractors and the absence of an immediate appeal would have worked an injury to them if not corrected before an appeal from a final judgment, the court held that the appeal was not premature. Affirming the trial court's decision, the court held that, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 87-1 et seq., the contractors were barred from affirmatively asserting their claims under the contract because they had no contractors' license and had contracted to construct a dwelling for the homeowners for a price in excess of $ 30,000. The court rejected the contractors' argument that they should not have been so barred because they contracted to build the dwelling on their own property. The &sect; 87-1 prohibition applied to a builder who contracted with another to construct any building without obtaining the requisite license, regardless of who owned the land.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer further argued that this was the interpretation given to the term in accounting practice, suggesting that to do otherwise would result in an unconstitutional application of the taxing statute. The Secretary argued that the statute, and administrative interpretations of it, supported a finding that customer advances under contracts were not accounts payable to the payee. Upon review, the court affirmed the trial court's decision, holding that the taxpayer was not entitled to deduct the customer advances received pursuant to its construction contracts as accounts payable under &sect; 105-201.

The court found that the act's purpose was to control erosion and sedimentation, rather than only land-disturbing activities. The court held that subjecting the facts to the act did not constitute retroactive application because all of the requirements for invoking the act were met, namely, the condition of the land resulted from land-disturbing activities, the land exceeded one acre in size, and the land experienced accelerated erosion that was causing damages off the property by silting a nearby river.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parent claimed that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-289.32 violated Equal Protection principles because it discriminated against parents, according to their financial circumstances, by authorizing termination of their rights for the economic failure to pay for their child's foster care costs. The parent also claimed the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-289.32(4) did not make any distinction between parents similarly situated. The court also concluded that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 7A-289.32(2) and (4) were not vague because the terms used were given a precise and understandable meaning by the normative standards imposed upon parents in society, and parents were therefore, given sufficient notice of the types of conduct that constituted child neglect in the state of North Carolina. The court held that the provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 7A-289.32(2) and (4) were sufficiently definite to be applied in a uniform manner to protect both the state's substantial interest in the welfare of minor children and the parents' fundamental right to the integrity of their family unit.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the award of specific performance and found that the jury verdict was not a compromise verdict because the jury had found no evidence of actual damages and, therefore, had awarded nominal damages. The court held that there was nothing in the agreement to prohibit the former wife from having a relationship with another man and the trial court did not err in excluding evidence and refusal to submit an issue to the jury concerning such relationship. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering specific performance because the former wife's legal remedy was inadequate, and it properly excluded evidence and refused to submit an issue to the jury, pursuant to his request, as to whether she had given full and fair consideration to support his promise to pay her alimony. The court found that his attorney-client privilege had not been compromised because he was not represented by counsel and the allegedly privileged communications occurred while the former wife was present.</SPAN></P>

The corporation prevailed under the Act. At the close of trial, the corporation filed a motion for attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. The trial court found that &sect; 1988 was inapplicable to the relief obtained by the corporation pursuant to the Act.

The court reasoned that because the claim regarding the invalid warrant was dismissed by the Commissioner, the corporation failed to show any deprivation of rights as required in order to claim relief under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and failed to meet the first prong of the test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the denial of defendant's motions and his conviction.

Therefore, he had no constitutional right to discover the name of the informant. Although N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-978(b) required disclosure of an informant's identity in some situations, the court found that the action fell under the second exception in the statute. There was corroboration of the informant's existence independent of the testimony in question. The deputy testified that he listened to both telephone conversations between the informant and the officer. That was sufficient corroboration of the officer's testimony relating to the informant. The warrantless search of defendant's vehicle was lawful. Prior to the search, the officers corroborated the informant's tip to the last detail through their observations. The officer testified at the hearing that the confidential informant was known to him and had proven reliable on prior occasions with information concerning drug distribution.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A uniform traffic citation was issued against defendant, which stated that the undersigned officer had probable cause to believe that defendant did unlawfully and wilfully operate a motor vehicle on a street or highway by hunting deer with dogs in violation of Senate Bill No. 391 which prohibited the same. On appeal, defendant contended that the &quot;bill&quot; violated his due process rights where any person, adult or child, who while in the company of a dog, which in response to its natural instincts, suddenly and without warning, caught the scent of a deer or a fox and gave chase, was subject to a criminal violation. The court held that: (1) the citation was fatally defective in that it failed to allege a violation of the criminal laws and it failed to comply with the requirements of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-302; and (2) it was unnecessary for the court to reach defendant's argument alleging the constitutionality of the &quot;bill,&quot; which apparently was derived from the ancient dog-draw of old forest law, where the court could dispose of the issue on the ground of the invalidity of the process.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not err in refusing to appoint standby counsel on defendant's second request. The trial court had done so earlier, but defendant had changed his mind. The court refused to rule on several of defendant's contentions regarding denial of pretrial motions because defendant failed to preserve the errors on appeal. The court rejected defendant's challenge to the rule that uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice is sufficient to sustain a conviction. In any event, another witness also testified to defendant's presence at the scene of the crime.

Appellee was a member of appellant association, which had the responsibility of paying claims against appellee if it became insolvent. Under N.C. Gen.

The court determined that the limitation on the introduction of prior conviction evidence found in N.C. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Alamance County Superior Court (North Carolina), which entered a jury verdict convicting defendant of rape. Defendant assigned error to the trial court's ruling sustaining the State's objections under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-58.6(b) to defendant's attempt to ask the victim whether she had been living with a man at the time of the alleged rape and whether she had an abortion subsequent to the alleged rape.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant also argued that &sect; 8-58.6(b) denied his Sixth Amendment right to cross-examine a witness against him. On appeal, the court disagreed and affirmed. Section 8-58.6(b) provided that the sexual behavior of a victim of an alleged rape was irrelevant unless it was between the victim and the defendant or unless it was offered to show that the act charged was not committed by the defendant or that the victim either consented to or invented the act. In the instant case, the victim's father corroborated her testimony by stating that the victim's personality changed after the date of the rape but began to improve several weeks later. Because the questions defendant attempted to ask the father related to conduct or situations occurring after the time frame to which the father's testimony related, the court held that the questions were properly excluded because they would not have impeached that testimony. Finally, while defendant had a constitutional right to confrontation, he did not have a right to any particular rule of evidence. Thus, the change &sect; 8-58.6(b) had on the rules by excluding evidence of collateral matters did not violate defendant's Sixth Amendment right.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the convictions, holding that the affidavit containing the statement that a strong odor of marihuana was noticed as a license check was being made on the driver of said vehicle was evidence from which the magistrate properly concluded that there was probable cause for a search warrant. Similarly, the affidavit for the search warrant of the residence contained articulate reasons for suspicion of drug offenses in that the area was regularly used by smugglers of marijuana, the officer had seen activity around the premises that made him suspicious, he had been fired upon while keeping the property under surveillance from the water, and he had seen a boat aground in the area of the premises without a satisfactory reason to him for its being there.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sign owners challenged the applicability of a zoning ordinance as it applied to their respective cases. The sign owners argued that the ordinance constituted an unconstitutional taking, denied them free speech, and violated their equal protection rights. The court determined that the amortization provisions of the zoning ordinance were reasonable as they applied to the sign owners because it was the visual effect of the sign, not the underlying land, which was the subject of the regulation. Therefore, there was no taking. The court also held that the zoning ordinance did not infringe on the sign owners right to free speech because the ordinance did not attempt to censor the content of the signs, nor did it impose any prior restraints on expression. The court concluded that the statutory authority that permitted districting and classification of areas for purpose of land use regulation had a reasonable basis and the zoning ordinance neither denied the sign owners equal protection under U.S. Const. amend.

However, double jeopardy protected defendants from multiple punishments for the same offense and the court held that arrest of judgment upon their conviction of assault with a deadly weapon was required. Assault and the use of a deadly weapon were necessarily included in the offense of assault on a law enforcement officer with a firearm, for which defendants were convicted, resulting in defendants being punished twice for the same offense. The court found no error in the trial court's refusal to instruct the jury that the illegality of an arrest was a defense to resisting arrest. No evidence was presented at trial to support such an instruction. Defendants were arrested pursuant to valid warrants.

The advertiser alleged that his sign was illegally revoked. The trial court ruled in favor of the advertiser, and the court reversed. It held that N.C. Admin.

Regardless of the cost of re-erecting the sign, the sign was completely blown down by the wind within the meaning of &sect; 2H.0209(12). The advertiser failed to make any argument that either the sign was not nonconforming or that the sign was not re-erected after the storm. He was not entitled to any administrative hearing by the secretary because the action of the secretary in reviewing a written appeal from a decision of the district engineer did not require an adjudicatory hearing and did not trigger the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act.</SPAN></P>

The import company did not appoint a process agent in North Carolina, so the lumber company provided substitute service on the North Carolina Secretary of State. The trial court dismissed the action for insufficient service of process. The court affirmed the trial court's order and held that the import company had sufficient contacts with North Carolina to justify the trial court's jurisdiction over it pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 75.8. The court held, however, that the lumber company provided insufficient service of process on the import company because the import company did not transact business for purposes of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 55-131(b) when it engaged in only one transaction in North Carolina, and, therefore, service of process on the secretary of state pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 55-144 was improper. The court further held that the service on the secretary of state was improper under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 55-145 because the lumber company's cause of action did not arise out of any contract made in North Carolina.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of conviction of the Guilford County Superior Court (North Carolina), which was entered on a jury verdict that found him guilty under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-202.1(a)(1) of taking indecent liberties with a child. Defendant argued that &sect; 14-202.1(a)(1) was unconstitutional, that N.C. Pattern Instructions Crim. No. 226.85 should not have been given, and that Fed. R. Evid. 608(b) should have been followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At trial on cross-examination, the prosecutor asked defendant if he had recently hit a man in the head and stole money from him. Defendant answered in the negative. The trial court gave N.C. Pattern Instructions Crim. No. 226.85, an instruction which did not include the willfulness element of the offense. Here on appeal, defendant contended that the court needed to follow Fed. R. Evid. 608(b), which limited cross-examination regarding unrelated conduct. He also argued that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-202.1(a)(1) was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed the conviction. That court had previously held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-202.1(a)(1) was not void for vagueness. The court did not believe that it was at liberty to follow Fed. R. Evid. 608(b). The prosecutor's question was proper for impeachment because it concerned specific misconduct by defendant. Even if the question was not specific enough, it was not prejudicial in light of the evidence of guilt. It was improper to reject defendant's proffered jury instruction on willfulness. However, the error was harmless because the jury implicitly found, and the evidence showed, that defendant had acted willfully.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In order to determine whether a fetus was a &quot;person,&quot; the court examined historical conditions and law and considered the U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of similar wording in the federal constitution.

The citizen next argued that the appropriation and expenditure of state tax monies for elective abortions violated N.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 5. The court disagreed and held that establishing an elective abortion fund was a legitimate and proper use of state tax money to aid the poorer citizens of the state. The court also held that the county's use of state funds for elective abortions was proper because the county acted pursuant to the administrative rules governing the State Abortion Fund, which were validly enacted, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 143B-153. In support of its conclusion, the court also pointed out that N.C. Gen.

Requiring defendant to stand before the jury did not violate his constitutional protection against self-incrimination. The exhibition of certain characteristics of defendant's person did not offend the &quot;sense of justice&quot; so as to warrant a new trial. The trial court did not abuse its discretion erred in allowing testimony as to whether an &quot;unusual&quot; amount of traffic had been observed around defendant's home during the months preceding the alleged illegal transaction. Nor did the testimony concerning the amount of traffic around defendant's house constitute the expression of an improper opinion. The statutory scheme providing that, in a prosecution under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-95, proof of an exemption for the possession or the sale or delivery of controlled substances through authorization had to be provided by the defendant did not run afoul of constitutional standards.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county passed an ordinance barring mobile homes with certain dimensions. Since the owners' mobile home was less than the prescribed dimensions, their mobile home was barred by the ordinance.

This appeal ensued, with the owners arguing the ordinance was violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution or N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. The court found the owners did not met their burden of showing that the ordinance did not rest on any reasonable basis, but was, essentially, arbitrary. The court found that mobile homes could be restricted by zoning ordinances to mobile home parks. Mobile homes were sufficiently different from other types of housing so that there was a rational basis for placing different requirements upon them, as was done by the county.

The court noted that the order that the state sought to have reviewed was an interlocutory order. The court noted that it was a dismissal without prejudice, which did not bar further prosecution. N.C. Gen. Stat. 15A-703. As such, the court found that the interlocutory order did not finally dispose of the case or charge against defendant and that therefore it was not appealable. The court noted that if the prosecution were allowed to appeal as a matter of right such orders dismissing a charge without prejudice, it would defeat the very principles of speedy trial that the statute sought to protect. The court also held that where a criminal charge was dismissed without prejudice upon defendant's motion under the Speedy Trial Act, the trial of defendant upon further prosecution by the State must begin within 120 days from the date the order was entered dismissing the charge without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

Most of the buyer's orders were placed over the telephone. The trial court granted the seller's motion to dismiss pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ.

Laws ch. 711, &sect; 1, because the trial transcript had not yet been delivered to the clerk of court. The trial court granted the State's motion, holding that &sect; 15A-1448(a)(4) was unconstitutional because it conflicted with the North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure, which had been adopted in accordance with N.C. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13(2). Defendant appealed. The court held that the trial court acted properly in granting the State's motion under N.C. R.

However, it was unnecessary for the trial court to have declared &sect; 15A-1448(a)(4)&nbsp;unconstitutional because it had been amended before its stated effective date so as to delete the offending portion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted after having been represented by the same attorney that was also representing his wife. Defendant filed a motion for appropriate relief on the basis that he was prevented from offering exculpatory evidence because such evidence tended to incriminate his wife. The motion was denied, and defendant sought review. The court held that there was nothing in the record to indicate a conflict of interest between defendant and his wife, noting that there was nothing to indicate what the excluded testimony would have been. The court accordingly rejected defendant's argument, noting that it had no basis upon which to rule on defendant's contention. For the same reason, the court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-57, dealing with the incompetence of a witness to testify against his spouse, did not apply. The court then held that defendant's failure to raise his objections in a prior motion for post-conviction relief operated as a waiver of those objections, despite that defendant was not represented by counsel at the time. The court reasoned that absence of counsel did not prevent defendant from raising such objections.</SPAN></P>

The mentally retarded person argued that the trial court erred in denying her motion for directed verdict and that evidence relative to her morals, sexual activity, attitude about birth control, and statements that in her youth she got impatient and angry with children left in her care, was irrelevant and remote. The court affirmed the judgment because the evidence supported the verdict and the mentally retarded person had a fair trial. The court held that a presumption of unfitness founded solely on retardation was not warranted and that the state's officer proved by clear, strong, and convincing evidence that the mentally retarded person was subject to the sterilization statutes and had a physical, mental, or nervous disease or deficiency, that her deficiency was not likely to improve, and that she would probably be unable to care for a child or children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board held a hearing into possible improprieties in a county election on its own motion. At the hearing, there was evidence that certain absentee ballots were irregularly and illegally returned to the supervisor for county elections. The absentee ballots were collected and stored at offices of candidates and improperly sealed. The ballots were stored in places where there was free and easy access by the public. There was also evidence that some voters were paid and told how to vote. Some of the individuals completing absentee ballots were not qualified to vote. The supervisor of county elections admitted that she lied about collecting and certifying the absentee ballots in order to have the ballots counted. The Board voided the election and ordered a new election. The court found that the Board had the authority, on its own motion, to investigate the election, that notice of the hearing was sufficient, that the hearing procedures were lawful, and that the Board had the power to order a new election.

The tenant argued the landlord's claims against her should have been brought as a compulsory counterclaim in the tenant's action. The court disagreed and affirmed the denial of the tenant's motion to dismiss. While both actions arose from a common relationship, the summary ejectment action was distinct from the tenant's action. The court found that although a logical relationship existed between the factual backgrounds of the two actions, there was no logical relationship between the nature of the actions. The tenant argued the summary ejectment proceeding set out in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 42-26(1), 42-32 was unconstitutional. The court found the procedure constitutional. The tenant had no right to possession once the lease expired and the landlord gave proper notice to vacate.

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and held that defendant's arrest warrant was not required to set forth a charge that his conduct was not within the exception of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-401. The court found no actual prejudice to defendant by the omission of a &quot;not within the exception&quot; statement in the indictment because the warrant sufficiently apprised him of the crime from which he was charged and the state had carried the entire burden of proof on the exception. The court rejected defendant's contention that &sect; 14-401 was unconstitutionally vague. Additionally, the trial court properly admitted into evidence the pie pan and its contents relating to the chemical analysis.

The trial court properly denied a motion for nonsuit where there was sufficient evidence of participation to carry the matter to the jury and to support the verdict.

It had been improper to rule upon the constitutionality of ch. 1138 on a motion to dismiss. However, the error was harmless because the citizens lacked standing because they failed to allege any direct injury from the supposed unconstitutionality of ch. 1138. The claim of injury to restaurants and clubs was useless without an allegation that the citizens were owners of such restaurants and clubs. The citizens attempt to create standing by alleging at a named 20 year old citizen was injured because he could vote but not buy mixed drinks was insufficient to create standing because there was no showing that he was in fact injured.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation alleged that the arrestee had written &quot;payment in full&quot; on a check after it had been accepted and had cleared the bank, in an effort to defeat the corporation's collection efforts.

The arrestee filed actions against the corporation and its attorneys, and the trial court granted their motions for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgments. The process was used in the manner in which it was intended, so no abuse of discretion was shown. The order of the trial court under which the arrestee was arrested, although erroneous, was not void, and it protected against an action for false imprisonment both the officer who made the arrest and defendants, who had procured the order to be entered. Summary judgments dismissing his claim for false imprisonment were properly entered.

On appeal, the corporation contended that the trial court erred in concluding that it had failed to state claims under the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. The court reversed the trial court's ruling that the corporation had no standing to sue but affirmed the trial court's judgment dismissing the corporation's equal protection and due process claims for failure to state a claim. Neither the North Carolina Constitution nor the U.S. Constitution provided corporations with a fundamental, inalienable right of suffrage. Accordingly, for equal protection purposes, there was a rational basis for the classification of persons allowed to participate in annexation referenda under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-24, -25.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In his appeal from the Council's denial of his application for reinstatement, the attorney argued that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 84-32 was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power because it gave the Council unfettered discretion in restoring licenses. On appeal, the court held that the attorney failed to satisfy his burden of proving that he had been properly reformed. The court found that the legislature delegated to the Council the duty of ascertaining whether a disbarred attorney had presented satisfactory evidence of reformation to be entitled to the restoration of his license. The court found that such delegation was permissible so long as the legislature prescribed a sufficient standard of guidance. The court found that under N.C. St. Bar art IX, &sect; 25(A)(3), the attorney had to demonstrate that he possessed the moral qualifications and competency to practice law and that the resumption of the practice would not be detrimental to the bar. The court further found that the Council's finding as to the attorney's fitness was supported by the fact that the attorney had failed to make restitution on two outstanding judgments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff insurers sought review of certain conclusions of law made by the Superior Court of Wake County (North Carolina) in an action filed by the insurers under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;1-264 to obtain a declaratory judgment that all health care liability insurance applications received and binders issued to defendants, associations and individual physicians (insureds), under 1975 N.C. Sess. Laws 427 were null, void, and unenforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In one of contested conclusions of law No. 6, the trial court concluded that the binder issued to the insureds during a certain time period was still valid and in full force and effect. The insurers also assigned error to the trial court's conclusion that there was no existing controversy between the insurers and defendants other than the insureds that appeared in the suit. The court reversed the judgment and held that the conclusions of law to which exceptions were taken and the judgment rendered were not supported by the findings of fact, and the judgment itself was not supported by the findings of fact and the conclusions of law made by the trial court. The court determined that the binder was void from its inception issued under protest and placing the insureds on notice that the insurers intended to consider the policy &quot;null and void as of the inception date&quot; if given the option to do so based on a judicial opinion declaring 1975 N.C. Sess. Laws 427 invalid. The court further held that there appeared to be no reason for denying the insurers the declaratory relief given that the possibility of litigation by non-appearing defendants was neither remote nor speculative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment entered in favor of the insureds and, as to the portion of the judgment that denied declaratory relief on the issue of the validity of binders issued to other defendants, the cause was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the North Carolina Milk Commission, challenged a judgment from the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina), which did not make findings of fact in its order after making conclusions of law, and which concluded that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 106-266.8 and that N.C. Admin. Code tit. 4, r. 7.0505 violated the North Carolina Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the trial court entered a decision adverse to the Commission, the Commission argued that the trial court failed to make findings of fact in its order to support its conclusions of law. On appeal, however, the court upheld the trial court's judgment. Specifically, the court first noted that when a judge of a trial court sat as an appellate court to review the decision of an administrative agency, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 150A-50, the judge was not required to make findings of fact and enter a judgment in the same sense as a trial judge, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 52(a). Secondly, the court noted that pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 106-266.8, which gave the Commission the power to regulate the transportation, processing, storage, distribution, delivery, and sale of milk for consumption, the Commission adopted N.C. Admin. Code tit. 4, r. 7.0505. Lastly, while addressing a question before the court regarding the sale of a milk product, the court concluded that a prior opinion was controlling on the current issues before the court.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the entrance onto private property by the police for the purpose of a general inquiry was proper and that the police were not trespassers. It was not erroneous for the trial judge to conclude that the officers were lawfully at the scene. The trial judge's conclusion of law that the officers standing on the porch saw in plain view and smelled what appeared to be marijuana inside of the house was amply supported by his findings of fact and met the standard of appellate review because they were lawfully at the scene and inadvertently discovered the marijuana. The conclusion that there were exigent circumstances was correct, which was adequate to justify the warrantless search and sufficient to excuse the officers from the knock and announce requirement.</SPAN></P>

One taxpayer opined that his interests as a citizen and a taxpayer were affected by the proposed annexation statute, 1969 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 1058, &sect; 2. On appeal, the court declined to consider the taxpayers' allegations of error on the ground that they lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute because they failed to allege any specific injury. The broad reference to &quot;economic injury&quot; in the taxpayers' motion to intervene was not a concrete allegation of direct injury. Moreover, the one taxpayer's subjective opinion that he was burdened by the proposed annexation was not sufficient to establish standing. The court also held that the taxpayers lacked standing in their capacity as citizens as well because a general interest in good government was insufficient to establish standing. The court held that the City lacked standing to question the limitations placed by the North Carolina legislature on its power to annex because the City, as a municipality, was a creature of the legislature and an agency of the State.</SPAN></P>

However, the state's evidence rebutted this and the trial judge found defendant was not threatened, coerced, or intimidated by any show of violence or threat of arrest. Defendant argued that this event constituted an unlawful arrest; therefore, it was error for the trial court to deny his motion to suppress the evidence of the pistol. The court affirmed the conviction, finding no error. It held that the encounter was an investigatory stop based on reasonable suspicion of the commission of a crime.

Gen. Stat. &sect; 110-88(1) for Bible schools conducted during vacation periods. The court affirmed judgment, holding that: (1) the Act was constitutional on its face and as applied to the defendants because the licenses did not relate to the defendants' ministries in any manner, but to the condition of their physical facilities; (2) the exception for vacation Bible schools was not applicable because the day care facilities provided care away from home on a regular basis year around and were not temporary; (3) Wake County was the proper venue for the declaratory judgment action; and (4) the motion for preliminary injunction was properly granted because there was probable cause to believe the state could establish the rights asserted and there existed a reasonable apprehension of irreparable loss unless the relief was granted.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the ordinance under consideration was a business regulation, thus, the fundamental due process inquiry was whether the ordinance gave a person of ordinary intelligence notice that his contemplated conduct was forbidden by the ordinance. The court held that the ordinance under which defendant was convicted provided him with sufficient notice that operating a massage business without a privilege licenses was prohibited. The court also held that the facts that two ordinances might have applied to defendant did not deny him notice that a privileged license was required to operate his massage business. The court also ruled that defendant's contention that that the ordinance was so vague as to permit arbitrary enforcement was not addressed on appeal because there was no evidence that defendant ever applied for a license. In addition, the court held that the ordinance did not violate equal protection because exclusions for certain professionals were reasonable.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court properly denied the wife's motion to dismiss the second action on the ground that the husband was required to seek absolute divorce as a compulsory counterclaim in the first action. The court determined that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 50-6, as amended by 1977 N.C. Sess. Laws 1190, &sect; 1, permitted the second action. The court ruled that N.C. Gen.

However, the court held that the trial court's judgment for the husband was not a summary judgment because the trial court heard testimony and evidence and made findings of fact.

In 1972, the State increased the rent pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 113-202(j). The harvester claimed that the new statute violated the Contracts Clause of the federal constitution.

The court held that the original 1942 lease only granted the harvester one renewal. The court held that the law did not favor perpetuities and that the unambiguous intention of the parties was to provide a single renewal.

The court held that the ordinance made presence on school property after sundown unlawful, but excepted from the operation of the ordinance any participant in an extracurricular activity upon school property, when such activity has been approved in advance by the Superintendent of Schools. The Court held that although the Superintendent's decision as to whether a particular extracurricular activity was permitted would have the effect of determining when it was unlawful to be upon school property, it defied common sense to believe that he would approve or disapprove an activity simply for the purpose of making presence upon the school grounds illegal. Therefore, the court found that the ordinance was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and held that the ordinance in question was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The employee was demoted for allegedly refusing to cooperate with his superiors in the undertaking of an investigation. The State Personnel Commission ordered that the employee be reinstated. The court held that the Commission exceeded its authority. The court noted that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 126-37 gave the Commission the authority to reinstate an employee and did not require that the employee have been wrongfully removed in order for the Commission to exercise its power. However, the court found that &sect; 126.37 had to read in conjunction with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 126-35 which forbid demotion without just cause. The court found that the employee's refusal to cooperate was just cause for his demotion. The court stated that it was unlikely that the general assembly intended the Commission to have the power to restore a state employee to a position from which he had been demoted without some finding that the employee had been treated wrongfully.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The guardians ad litem contended that N.C. Gen.

The guardians ad litem argued that the statute was an impermissible discrimination between the rights of legitimate and illegitimate children to inherit from their fathers. On appeal, the court found that under &sect; 29-19 the illegitimate child was entitled to inherit from its father only if paternity had been acknowledged in writing or finally adjudged in the lifetime of the father. The court found that the child's rights to inherent also hinged on compliance with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 49-1 through 49-9 and the provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 49-14 through 49-16, which required an affirmative act of the father or a court to recognize the child as the father's own. In affirming, the court held that the statutes under scrutiny showed an evident and substantial relation to the permissible and important interest of the State in providing for the just and orderly disposition of property at death. The court held that both methods of establishing paternity rendered N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-19 constitutionally sound.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's order. Under a balancing of interests analysis, including the state's interest in protecting the dependent child, the mother's right to protection from arbitrary removal of custody, and the child's best interests, the mother's due process rights were adequately protected where N.C.

The trial court granted appellee citizen's motion to dismiss the citation he received for deliberately displaying an artificial light from a vehicle into a field that was frequented by wild deer between certain hours.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The general assembly's purpose in enacting the chapter was to protect wildlife from indiscriminate slaughter. The enactment of laws reasonably related to protecting wildlife was a valid exercise of the police power. However, the court agreed with the trial court and found that 1975 N.C. Sess. Laws 269 was unconstitutional because the statute was overbroad and unreasonably interfered with otherwise innocent conduct. Generally, the court would not substitute its judgment for that of the general assembly in determining whether the act was in the public interest. In this case, the chapter prohibited any shining of the light into the area past the roadway during the evening hours and could be construed to prohibit car drivers from having their headlight on during the certain hours listed in the statute. The law would apply to all motorists operating a car in a manner that was otherwise legal and was overbroad.

The court held under N.C. Gen.

However, the trial judge did not have the authority to permit the jury to take exhibits or other materials that had not been received in evidence. The court held that when the trial judge stated his reason for the ruling, he committed error prejudicial to defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff former wife sought review of an order of the Wake County District Court (North Carolina), which concluded that she was not a dependent spouse within the meaning of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 50-16.1(3) in considering her application for alimony pendente lite from defendant former husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wife sought alimony pendente lite from her husband. Under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 50-16.2, 50-16.3, the wife could only get the alimony if she was a dependent spouse substantially in need of maintenance and support. The trial court concluded that the wife was not a dependent spouse within the meaning of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 50-16.1(3). In vacating the order, the court held that the trial court's finding was insufficient to support its conclusion that the wife was not a dependent spouse because it failed to include a finding that the wife had a reasonable opportunity to, but did not, adequately support herself. The court observed that there was a statutory presumption in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 50-16.1(4) that the husband was the supporting spouse once it was established that he was capable of supporting her. As a result, the wife was the dependent spouse unless the husband presented evidence to show that she was not actually dependent. The court held that trial court's finding that the wife was gainfully employed prior to her marriage and that she was able-bodied, intelligent, and capable of finding employment was insufficient to support its finding that she was not dependent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the trial court's order and it remanded the case to the trial court for a new hearing on the wife's application for alimony pendente lite and counsel fees and for other actions in accordance with the applicable law and the present status of the parties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Moore County Superior Court (North Carolina), which sentenced him by attaching a recommendation for restitution or reparation as a condition of work release or parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in attaching the recommendation for restitution or reparation as a condition of work release or parole. Defendant argued that the two statutes under which the recommendation was made, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 148-33.2(c) and N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 148-57.1(c), were confusing because they referred to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;15-199(10), which had been repealed. Section 15-199(10) provided for restitution or reparation as a condition of probation. The court found, however, that the two statutes had been amended to refer to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1343(d), the new section regarding restitution; thus, any confusion had been remedied. The court determined that the Secretary of the Department of Correction and the Parole Commission was not required to take the recommendation of the trial court but that the decision was discretionary. Because restitution and reparation were valid conditions of parole, the trial court did not err in its recommendation, and the court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant argued that &sect; 14-177 did not include the act of a consensual fellatio between an adult male and an adult female. The court rejected this argument, noting that force was not an essential element of the offense. The court also rejected defendant's argument that his right to privacy, under the Fourteenth Amendment, prevented him from being prosecuted under &sect; 14-177. In so ruling, the court distinguished a prior case where the court extended the reach of the Equal Protection Clause to unmarried couples because the statute was not aimed at prohibiting certain sexual behavior, but was designed to prevent unmarried people from using contraception. Here, the court found, the statute prohibited certain sexual actions. Moreover, the court noted that it did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment to classify unmarried persons so as to prohibit them from engaging in a certain sexual act without placing the same prohibition on married persons. Finally, the court ruled that &sect; 14-177 was not unconstitutionally vague. The court found that a person of ordinary intelligence would have concluded that a fellatio between a man and a woman was a criminal act under &sect; 14-177.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of an order by the Forsyth County Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted defendant of the felonious possession of marijuana and hashish.

The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress. Defendant pleaded guilty and was sentenced.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the hearing on the motion, defendant attempted to show that the affidavit on which the warrant was based contained false information that was crucial for the probable cause determination. At the end of the hearing, the trial court concluded that the affiant, a police officer, had probable cause to believe that an informer was telling the truth and found that the officer had acted in good faith in obtaining the search warrant. The court stated that the statute permitting defendant to contest the validity of a search warrant and the admissibility of evidence obtained thereunder by contesting the truthfulness of the testimony showing probable cause for its issuance was N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-978(a). Section 15A-978 permitted defendant to challenge only whether an affiant acted in good faith in the use of information employed to establish probable cause and not to attack the factual accuracy of information supplied by an informant to the affiant. Therefore, the trial court properly excluded questions by defense counsel that were designed to show that the supporting affidavit contained false statements and not to show bad faith on the part of the officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that his arrest was illegal because the police arrested him outside their territorial jurisdiction. The evidence was uncontradicted that defendant was stopped by the officer's more than two miles outside the city limit. The court stated that the question was whether the arrest took place at that point or later at the police station. If the former was the case, the arrest was illegal. The court explained that where arrests were regulated by statute, an arrest that did not comply with the statute was illegal. However, the court found it unnecessary to determine whether the arrest was illegal, because an arrest, though illegal, might be constitutionally valid and the fact that an original arrest might have been unlawful did not preclude trial of the accused. The court held that considering the officer's own observations of defendant, and information given him by the other officers, there was ample evidence to provide him with probable cause to believe that a misdemeanor had been committed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant purchasers sought review of an order by the District Court, Buncombe County (North Carolina) in favor of plaintiff landowners in the landowners' action to remove a cloud from their title to certain real property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In their complaint, the landowners alleged that a sheriff's deed to the purchasers, based upon execution sale on a judgment for taxes, was void and constituted cloud on the landowners' title. The trial court declared the sheriff's deed void and cancelled it of record. The purchasers contended that the trial court erred in cancelling the sheriff's deed to them. The court stated that the sheriff's sale was invalid because there was evidence that the deputy sheriff posted a notice of sale at the courthouse door, but there was no evidence when the notice was posted. Further, the deputy sheriff failed to mail a notice of sale to the listed taxpayer at her last known address. Where the trial court found that a sheriff's deed to the purchasers, based upon execution sale on a judgment for taxes, was void, the trial court erred in denying the purchasers reimbursement for the taxes they paid on the property in question for the three previous years. The trial court properly denied the purchasers reimbursement for the costs of the sale.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court was modified to reflect that the purchasers were entitled to recover taxes paid. As modified, the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I. &sect; 20. The court disagreed. An administrative inspection warrant issued pursuant to N.C. Gen.

An applicant had to provide signed affidavits, and the issuing official had to examine the affiant to verify the accuracy of the matters in the affidavit. The warrant had to accurately and specifically describe the property sought to be inspected and to indicate the conditions, objects, activities, or circumstances that the inspection was intended to check or reveal. Although the warrant did not specifically indicate the objects of the inspection, the affidavits set out in great detail various objects and conditions that the inspection was intended to check or reveal, and the court held that it was sufficient to meet the provisions of the statute.&nbsp;N.C.

In finding no error, the court held that &sect; 14-415.1 was not unconstitutionally vague because it clearly delineated those to whom it applied and the classes of conduct proscribed, so that a person of ordinary intelligence would be apprised of the conduct forbidden. Further, the court found no constitutional difficulty with &sect; 14-415.1's classification scheme as applied to defendant because there was clearly a reasonable relation between the classification, those convicted of a crime of violence, and the purpose of the statute, which was protection of the people from violence. Nor did the court find the statute invalid because the restriction applied during the five years after conviction, discharge from a correctional institution, or termination of a suspended sentence, probation, or parole, whichever was later.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a class action, several plaintiffs, including a lumber company, challenged a decision of the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina), which dismissed the action against defendant labor commissioner. Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief from the enforcement of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 95-136(a) and 15-27.2(c)(1). The court only considered the appeal of the lumber company because the other plaintiffs' rights were not immediately threatened.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lumber company was cited and fined for refusing to allow inspections without a warrant and with an administrative inspection warrant. The court found that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 95-136(a) violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the extent that it authorized warrantless searches. Thus, &sect; 95-136(a) was found to be unconstitutional. But, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-27.2(c)(1) did not violate either the Unites States or the North Carolina Constitutions. Section 15-27.2(c)(1) provided for the issuance of administrative inspection warrants by a magistrate or clerk of court and was constitutional because the program of inspection under &sect; 15-27.2(c)(1) met the requirements of probable cause. Because no facts from which the issuing officer could determine whether probable cause existed were included in the affidavit, the affidavit was insufficient to support the issuance of the administrative search warrant. Finally, the warrant was improperly granted not only because the affidavit was insufficient to support it, but also because there was no showing that the general administrative plan for enforcement was being applied on a neutral basis as to the lumber company's establishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of dismissal as to the lumber company. The court ruled that the lumber company was entitled to a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with violating N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-113.9, which prohibited the intentional inhalation of fumes or vapors for the purpose of causing a condition of intoxication, inebriation, excitement, stupefaction, or the dulling of the brain or nervous system. Defendant challenged the statute as unconstitutionally vague. The trial court agreed, and the State appealed. On review, the court reversed and remanded. The court noted that the constitutional requirement of definiteness was violated by a criminal statute if it failed to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct was forbidden by the statute. If the general class of offense to which the statute was directed was plainly within its terms, it would not be struck down as vague, even though marginal cases could be imagined. Thus, if the general class of offenses could be made constitutionally definite by a reasonable construction of the statute, the court was under a duty to give the statute that construction. The court found that the statute was sufficiently definite and would not be interpreted by a reasonable person to prohibit the inhalation of tobacco or perfume.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prosecution argued that defendants' motion to quash should not have been granted because the statutes involved were constitutional on their face, constitutional as applied, and proscribed the conduct alleged in each summons.

The court held that the statute challenged by defendant met both requirements of the test. The court held that the protection of citizens from bodily injury was an important governmental objective; in fact, it was the most fundamental objective of government.

However, the state argued that the paper bag was in his plain view. Upon review, the court found that while the bag was in the trooper's plain view, the contents of it were not. The court determined that the trooper examined the bag as part of a warrantless inventory search of the vehicle. Defendant's car had been in accident, and the trooper was in charge of seeing that the wrecked automobile was safely transported from the scene and stored. It was reasonable for him to look into the paper bag to determine whether anything valuable belonging to the owner was in there. The court found that the trial court's comments to defense counsel correcting his confusion and limiting cross-examination were not so inordinately critical of his counsel so as to be prejudicial to defendant.

The policy was in accordance with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115-146, which allowed teachers to exercise lawful authority to maintain order. Also, the striking constituted corporal punishment because its purpose was to punish the students for wrongdoing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a decision of the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina), which denied his motions to dismiss the charges and to modify conditions for his release pending trial and denied his motion for discovery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant failed to comply strictly with the requirements of N.C. R. App. P. 28(b)(3) by not referring to the exceptions and assignments of error following each question presented in the argument portion of his brief. Because such references were properly made under the issues presented portion of the brief and defendant otherwise conformed with the appellate rules, the court considered the arguments. The court found that under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-903, defendant was not entitled to information on the internal policies of the district attorney's office. The denial of access to this information did not violate his due process and equal protection rights because he was not entitled to a full written description of the so-called career criminal program including the criteria used by the district attorney and the procedure to be followed in the prosecution of his case. Moreover, the initial detention of defendant and his vehicle was justified because the officers had received an accurate description of the suspect's vehicle. Additional discovery of the weapon in the officers' plain view was sufficient to ripen the suspicion of the officers into probable cause to arrest defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff resident filed an action in the Superior Court, Durham County (North Carolina) against defendants, church, city, redevelopment commission, and United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, seeking to enjoin a redevelopment plan. The trial court entered judgment for defendants. The resident appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city and the redevelopment commission entered into a cooperation agreement whereby the city agreed to provide one-third of the costs of the plan. Defendants argued that the transfer was governed by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160-464(c), which, defendants claimed, only required public notice if the property was sold not &quot;exchanged.&quot; The court held that the exchange of land between the redevelopment commission and the church was a private sale to a nonprofit association as described in &sect; 160-464(d) and, thus, compliance with &sect; 160-464(e)(4) was required. Because the redevelopment commission had first approved the transaction before it posted notice of the meeting, the conveyance was void ab initio and the court reversed the judgment for defendants with respect to the conveyance. However, the agreement was not a pledge of the city's faith and credit or a use of tax revenues in violation of N.C. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6, which forbade expenditure of tax funds without voter approval. The resident failed to show that the city was unable to meet its obligations under the agreement without spending public funds for unnecessary purposes. Thus, the court affirmed the validity of the agreement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a customer, sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County (North Carolina), which granted a motion by plaintiff, a commodities broker, to dismiss defendant's counterclaims, arising from plaintiff's alleged, unauthorized sale of futures contracts, among other things, in violation of the unfair practices statute,&nbsp;N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 75-1.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that plaintiff's unauthorized sale of futures contracts, unauthorized purchases of contracts to close out defendant's position, and subsequent liquidation of his cash and margin accounts constituted violations of the North Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 75-1.1, which entitled him to relief. On appeal, the court affirmed dismissal, holding that defendant might turn to traditional common-law actions to seek damages, but it would be inappropriate for the court to expand a traditional common-law action into an unfair trade practice in the face of pervasive federal regulatory scheme. State regulation of commodities brokers was pre-empted by the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2, and state court had no jurisdiction to issue injunction based on the state securities act. Although the enforcement of state regulatory acts would be precluded, traditional private causes of action such as fraud would be less likely to interfere with federal scheme and, thus, would not be necessarily pre-empted. Section 75-1.1 would not support a cause of action against a commodity broker for activity, which was regulated under the CEA, 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Court affirmed dismissal of counterclaims, holding that the state regulatory acts would not support defendant's action against plaintiff for an activity that was regulated under federal commodities statute. Recognizing unfair trade practice would create remedies unavailable at common law, and such expansion of state regulatory power would be improper when Congress had clearly expressed exclusive jurisdiction over activity of commodity exchanges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The widow, as a surviving spouse, chose to dissent from her deceased husband's will. Pursuant to N.C. Gen.

Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 30-1, the superior court determined that the widow had the statutory right to dissent based upon computations as to the aggregate value of provisions under the will for the widow, the value of any of the husband's property passing outside the will to the widow, and the value of the widow's intestate share. On the executor's appeal, the court affirmed the superior court's judgment for the widow by finding that, as the widow was not required to detail her reasons for exercising her statutory right to dissent from her husband's will, the executor had sufficient notice of the widow's intentions and the superior court had jurisdiction to find that the notice of dissent had been properly filed. By using tax tables and expert witnesses, the values which had to be determined under the constitutional statutory procedure were reasonably ascertained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city passed an ordinance, which reclassified a few lots into a historical district. The lots located adjacent to the lots effected by the ordinance remained uniformly zoned. The ordinance affected the owner's property. The trial court granted the city summary judgment. The trial court found that the city did not act arbitrarily or capriciously or deny equal protection of the laws when it adopted the ordinance and applied it to the owner's property. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that there were substantial issues of material fact. The owner introduced evidence that his property was affected by the ordinance while other similarly situated lots had not. The court found that the owner had made a prima facie showing of arbitrary and capricious spot zoning. Thus, the city was required to present a clear showing of a reasonable basis for the distinctions. The city failed to make such a showing that supported summary judgment in its favor. The city had also failed to show the existence of a comprehensive plan. Accordingly, the matter was remanded for a trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Pitt County Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted him of kidnapping and assault with intent to commit rape. Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in excluding testimony on cross-examination of a State's witness, in admitting testimony of another State's witness, in the general charge of the trial court, and in the signing of the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant alleged that there was error in the signing of the judgments based on all of his assignments of error. The court disagreed however, it determined that the record raised the question of whether defendant could be lawfully sentenced upon conviction of the charge of assault with intent to commit rape when the State had included that charge as a part of the kidnapping bill of indictment in order to subject defendant to the greater punishment under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-39(b). The court held that in order for the State to subject defendant to a punishment of greater than 25 years upon conviction of kidnapping, it had to prove that in the course of the kidnapping defendant either sexually assaulted the victim, or seriously injured the victim, or released the victim in an unsafe place under &sect; 14-39(b). By charging in the kidnapping bill that defendant committed a sexual assault in the course of the kidnapping and upon conviction and sentence for kidnapping, defendant was punished for the offense of assault with intent to commit rape. The separate sentence in the assault with intent to commit rape charge violated defendant's rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</SPAN></P>

The statute directed that the burden of the attorney fees incurred in effecting a recovery against the third party be borne by both the employee and the employer in proportion to the amount which each received out of the recovery, and this without regard to which one employed the attorney.

The military investigators were exercising the authority granted to them by the President of the United States and the United States Congress to search for and seize evidence of criminal violations on military bases. Further, the warrant did not violate the Fourth Amendment because it was issued upon probable cause by the commanding officer who was a neutral and detached magistrate.

The property owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state officials made initial proposals for a state park that contemplated ultimate acquisition of certain lands of the property owners. The summary judgment motion of the state officials was granted. On appeal, the property owners claimed that because one superior court judge denied the state officials' motion made under N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted on the grounds that there was no genuine controversy in existence, a different superior court judge could not thereafter allow the state officials' motion for summary judgment made on the same grounds. The superior court's decision granting summary judgment was affirmed. The court found that that the denial of the motion to dismiss was error because no genuine controversy existed as to make the case cognizable under the Declaratory Judgment Act. None of the property owners were &quot;directly and adversely affected&quot; by any statute they sought to challenge. Moreover, no condemnation proceeding had been instituted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant husband appealed a judgment of the Guilford County District Court (North Carolina) in favor of plaintiff wife and contended N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-6 was unconstitutional and challenged maintenance payments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-6, subsequently repealed, applied to the case and authorized a separation agreement only upon a privy exam of the wife, which the husband contended violated equal protection. He wanted a privy exam, too. The court declined to address whether the statute was constitutional because the husband did not have standing. Such a holding meant no privy exams and would have no effect on the husband. The second issue was whether the trial court erred in disallowing, for the purpose of maintenance and support payments, adjustments to gross income due to losses on the rental of the husband's beach cottage. The trial court found that the cottage was advertised for rent, that the husband and his wife occupied the cottage three or four weeks a year, and that it remained unoccupied for a considerable period of time. The Internal Revenue Service allowed the deductions. In order to prove her entitlement to an increased payment, the wife had to show that the property was not held for the production of income. The findings of part-time personal use and periods of vacancy did not support the conclusion that the husband was entitled to deductions only under 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 183.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment that denied the husband's motions to dismiss and in holding him liable under the separation agreement was affirmed. The judgment, insofar as it reflected an increase in the payments due as a result of disallowing certain deductions related to the rental of the beach cottage, was vacated, and the case was remanded for further findings of fact.</SPAN></P>

The decision was reversed on appeal after the superior court ruled that &sect; 20-19(e), especially the phrase &quot;liquor laws,&quot; was unconstitutionally vague, indefinite and overbroad and that a conviction for public drunkenness was not a violation of the liquor laws. On review, the court held that the phrase was not so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application. The court held that &sect; 20-19(e) was not unconstitutionally broad because public drunkenness was not a constitutionally protected activity, nor was any other conduct within the purview of the phrase &quot;violation of liquor laws of North Carolina.&quot; Finally, the court held that public drunkenness violated the &quot;liquor laws&quot; because the legislature demanded complete compliance with all laws governing the use of drugs, alcohol, and motor vehicles and intended to include the crime of public drunkenness in the phrase &quot;violation of liquor laws of North Carolina.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Persons purchasing a license tag after that date were subject to a penalty. The car owner was assessed this penalty after he purchased a license tag after the due date. The car owner filed an action challenging the assessment of the penalty on the ground he did not obtain license plates for his car until after the due date. The trial court determined that the penalty was properly assessed, and the car owner appealed. The court reversed and remanded. In construing the town's resolution, the court was required to interpret it so as to save its constitutionality and to avoid a strict interpretation that would result in an absurd and unconstitutional result. As such, under the resolution, a late payment penalty could not be assessed unless it was determined that a vehicle was registered prior to the due date for purchasing a license tag. Here, the evidence clearly showed that the car owner registered his car after that date.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his subsequent conviction. In affirming, the court first held that the trial court's instruction distinguishing involuntary manslaughter from the lesser-included offense of death by vehicle was proper because N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-141.4, which defined death by a vehicle, did not require defendant to have acted recklessly or intentionally. The trial judge had not incorrectly stated nor implied that the scope of &sect; 20-141.4 was limited to situations where there was no intent or recklessness. The court also held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to quash the jury array because North Carolina courts had previously held that the use of tax scrolls and voter registration books to compile a jury roll was not unconstitutional. Finally, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict because it showed that defendant was driving under the influence of alcohol at an excessive rate of speed and was weaving from one side of the highway to the other when he struck the victim's well-lighted motorcycle from behind.</SPAN></P>

In so ruling, the court relied upon a decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court, which held that a timely demand under &sect; 105-267 was a prerequisite to bringing suit and that a failure to make such a demand forfeited the right to judicial review. Further, the court rejected the taxpayers' argument that a large number of taxpayers could have been affected by the tax, and that it would have been impractical to require them all to make such a demand. The court found that there was nothing in the record that suggested that a large number of taxpayers were entitled to a refund.

Appropriations for and expenditures by disbursement to private nonprofit education corporations did not serve a &quot;public purpose&quot; under N.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 2(1).

P. 4(b), that the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over the debtor, and that the trial court lacked quasi in rem jurisdiction, as the creditor's attempt to attach debts owed to the debtor by in-state entities was improper. The creditor attempted to amend its complaint under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 55-145 to allege that the basis of the dispute was a contract to be performed in the state, thus allowing the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the debtor. The debtor's motion was granted. The court reversed. Leave to amend should have been granted, as such leave was to be granted when justice so required. The court further held that personal jurisdiction was proper because the suit was based on a contract that had a substantial connection with the forum state. As to quasi in rem jurisdiction, the debts owed to the debtor were sufficiently related to the creditor's cause of action, as the debts suggested the existence of other ties among the debtor, the state, and the litigation.</SPAN></P>

The State further argued that the term &quot;immoral purpose&quot; as set forth under &sect; 14-186 meant illicit sexual intercourse. The trial court's judgment was affirmed on appeal. The court held that the trial court correctly ruled that a portion of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-186 was too vague and indefinite to comply with constitutional due process standards. The court noted that its opinion did not apply to statutes referring to &quot;immoral purposes&quot; that also contained phrases that could have been used to define immoral purposes.

Except for the powers conferred by its charter, a council could neither have possessed nor exercised any powers which were not specifically delegated by each of its member governments.

Further, the court found that the complaint failed to allege that plaintiffs had exhausted their administrative remedies. The court held that plaintiffs disregarded the statutes in question by failing to request reassignment, thereby taking a route wholly inconsistent with the statutes enacted by the general assembly.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner challenged a judgment from the Wayne County Superior Court (North Carolina) in an action concerning revocation of his driver's license. He argued that his arrest was illegal because the alleged violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-138 was a misdemeanor, which was not committed in the presence of the arresting officer, and that therefore the evidence related to the attempted administration of a breathalyzer test should have been excluded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner unsuccessfully sought to exclude evidence relative to the attempted administration of a breathalyzer test at a hearing on his driver's license, arguing that his misdemeanor arrest was illegal. The court stated that there was sufficient evidence to support the finding of the trial court that the arrest was legal and that petitioner refused to take the breathalyzer test. Petitioner approached the arresting officer at the scene of a collision and stated that he had been driving one of the vehicles. The officer detected a strong odor of alcohol, noticed that petitioner's eyes were bloodshot, that he was unsteady when walking, and that he swayed when stationary. The totality of the circumstances known to the officer was sufficient to give him probable cause to believe that petitioner had operated a motor vehicle upon a public highway while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-138. He also had probable cause, as required under N.C. Gen.

The nonresident's motion was based on lack of jurisdiction over both the subject matter and the person. Neither party was a resident of North Carolina and the action arose in Maryland.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the attachment proceeding was ancillary and did not give the court in personam jurisdiction over the non-resident. The court ruled that loss of jurisdiction was a procedural matter and did not find that it reached the level of vested rights. The court decided to apply Supreme Court precedent retroactively, which held that jurisdiction could not be based on the mere presence of property. The court ruled that N.C. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Superior Court, Wake County (North Carolina) found that the franchise agreement between plaintiff corporation and defendant dealer was terminated. The trial court enjoined the dealer from representing itself as the corporation's dealer. In making its determination, the trial court held that the notice requirements of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-305(6) (1973) were unconstitutional as impairing the obligations of contracts. The dealer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A franchise agreement expired by its terms. The corporation and the dealer also entered into a written contract, which provided for termination of their relationship. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in failing to rule as a matter of law that the corporation's attempts to terminate the franchise were void as against public policy and that the corporation was not entitled to injunctive relief. In so doing, the court noted that the corporation did not comply with &sect; 20-305(6), which required the corporation to give the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles notice prior to the termination or expiration of the automobile dealership franchise. Thus, the franchise continued until the statutory requirements were properly followed. Although the statutory notice requirements were, to some extent, an &quot;interference&quot; with the contract, the court found that &sect; 20-305(6) did not involve any disturbance of essential or core expectations or amount to a taking without compensation. Rather, &sect; 20-305(6) was a reasonable exercise of the state's police power in furtherance of the public welfare. Thus, the court held that &sect; 20-305(6) did not violate U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent judgment debtors appealed the judgment of the Superior Court, Guilford County (North Carolina), which held that the debtors were responsible for damages in favor of petitioner judgment creditor, in whose favor two appeal bonds existed, beyond the value of the bonds and interest on the bonds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of the judgment creditor in part but reversed in part. The judgment creditor, by petitioning the trial court for a recovery on the bonds, limited his recovery to the amount of the bonds, plus interest on the bonds. The judgment creditor's right to interest on the underlying indebtedness secured by the two bonds was defined respectively by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45-21.16, which governed only the bond covering the appeal from the clerk of court to the trial court, and N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-292, which governed the bond covering the appeal from the trial court to the court of appeals. The language of each bond, which made the surety liable for any probable loss by reason of the delay, governed the measure of damages because it was broader than either of the statutes. Because under that standard the judgment creditor had proven damages which exceeded the value of the bonds, it was entitled to the full value of the bonds, plus accrued interest on the bonds. The trial court's allowance of attorney's fees and ad valorem taxes was harmless because the judgment creditor's damages in any event exceeded the value of the bonds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment insofar as it awarded the judgment creditor the full value of the bonds and interest on the value of the bonds but reversed the judgment to the degree that the trial court awarded a judgment in excess of the value of the bonds and the interest thereon.</SPAN></P>

The court held that prosecutorial immunity was absolute because it was a particular manifestation of judicial immunity. The court also held that public officers enjoyed no special immunity for unauthorized acts, or acts outside their official duty; however, the law enforcement officers could not be deemed to have acted maliciously when they enforced a court order that was valid on its face. The court noted that the law enforcement officers were not expected to go behind the face of the order.

Defendant filed a motion to suppress the marijuana on the basis that there were no exigent circumstances that justified the warrantless search of his automobile. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held that common sense dictated that defendant, a civilian at what was a public area on a military base, would have attempted to flee the boundaries of the base had he realized that he was being observed by base authorities. The court ruled that the object of the search was contraband, and the automobile was being used for an illegal purpose at the time of the search. The court held that given the opportunity, defendant most certainly would have attempted to destroy the marijuana. The court ruled that due to the exigent circumstances, the warrantless search and seizure was not unreasonable. The court held that the information from the policeman, which was the basis for the search, clearly constituted probable cause for the search and seizure.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that although the attempted repayment came in the form of a bad check, the trial court properly concluded that the corporation's act of advancing the funds frustrated the purposes behind the enactment of &sect; 163-278.19. The court also held that the statute did not infringe on the corporation's right to freely contract because the encroachment on the corporation's contractual rights was reasonably related to a permissible State objective. Finally, the court held that although it would not enforce the illegal component of the parties' contract, the corporation may have been entitled to recover certain commissions.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss because he failed to met his burden of showing that the statute provided inadequate warning as to the conduct it covered or was incapable of uniform administration by the courts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged and convicted of the offense of kidnapping, pursuant to &sect; 14-39. Defendant appealed, claiming that &sect; 14-39, which was the new kidnapping statute, was unconstitutional because it violated his due process and equal protection rights by subjecting him to conviction for two crimes where only one was committed. The court affirmed and ruled that &sect; 14-39 required a finding of unlawful restraint, confinement, or asportation of the victim from one place or another for the purpose of facilitating the commission of any felony or facilitating the flight of any person following the commission of a felony. Thus, &sect; 14-39 did not violate defendant's constitutional rights by subjecting him to conviction for two crimes, and the evidence was sufficient to demonstrate the offense of kidnapping under &sect; 14-39 where defendant bound and restrained each victim for a substantial period of time, and such unlawful restraint was not merely incidental to the commission of the felony of crime against each victim, but was gratuitously committed against one victim while he was committing the crime upon the other.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss for failure of the indictment to charge a crime under N.C. Gen.

The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court held that the indictment was sufficient to apprise defendant of the offense with which he was charged and to enable the court to pronounce judgment. The court found that an indictment that charged the offense substantially in the words of the statute was sufficient. Defendant also objected to the trial court's allowing a police officer to testify that a witness had told him that defendant was responsible for the shooting. Defendant maintained that the testimony should not have been admitted because the witness had not testified that he made the statement to the officer. The court held that the testimony was admissible because the witness's statement and the officer's testimony were consistent with the witness's trial testimony. Regarding the trial court's refusal to suppress evidence of a cartridge shell, the court found that defendant consented to the search.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the warrant for disorderly conduct contained language declared to be unconstitutionally vague and was therefore fatally defective, and that the second warrant for resisting an officer should have been quashed because its validity was dependent upon the constitutionality and legality of the first warrant. The court of appeals held that superfluous words in a warrant beyond the essential elements of the crime charged could be disregarded. The warrant still alleged all the essential elements of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;14-288.4(a)(2) and met the requirements for a valid warrant to uphold the conviction. Defendant contended the evidence did not support a finding that he did any intentional act likely to provoke retaliation. The court held that the jury could reasonably interpret defendant's utterances as fighting words likely to provoke the average person to retaliation. Defendant claimed that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction for resisting arrest because the officer did not have probable cause to arrest him, and he had the right to resist the arrest as unlawful. The court ruled the arrest was lawful and defendant did not have the right to resist.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayers appealed orders from a trial court (North Carolina), which denied their motions for directed verdict and allowed the motions of defendant government officials and intervenor taxpayers for summary judgment in an action challenging the validity of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 131-4 et seq., which allowed for the creation of a township public hospital. Intervenors appealed the denial of their motion that plaintiffs' appeal be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After disposing of the motions in open court, the trial court did not direct entry of judgment and instead directed that a judgment be prepared for submission to opposing counsel and to him for approval. In seeking to dismiss plaintiffs' appeal, intervenors contended that because plaintiffs failed to take their appeal within 10 days after the rendition of judgment, the appeal was untimely. The court disagreed, noting that the trial judge stated that he had not directed the entry of any judgment and that any entry in the minutes was a clerical error. The court then held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 131-4 et seq. was a constitutional delegation of authority for a board of county commissioners to assume the role of &quot;governing body&quot; for the purpose of implementing that enabling legislation, including the levying of a tax to support a township hospital. The court found that contrary to plaintiffs' contention, townships could be vested with corporate powers to in order to promote the prosperity, safety, convenience, health, and common good of the people residing within that township, which were to be supervised by the county commissioners of the county in which the township was located.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The advertiser had an interest in advertising structures that were located near interstate freeways. After the Board revoked a permit for a certain advertising structure, the advertiser filed an action against defendants. The Board's ordinance provided that it was entitled to revoke any valid permit issued for an lawful outdoor advertising structure for unlawful violation of the control of access on interstate freeways. The ordinance also provided an appeal process of such a revocation decision. However, the advertiser never attempted the appeal process under the ordinance. The trial court held that the advertiser was entitled to maintain the action and defendants appealed. The advertiser argued that recourse to administrative remedies was not required because he was attacking the provisions of the Act and certain of the Board's regulations on constitutional grounds. The court reversed and held that the advertiser was unable to maintain the action because he had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. The court noted that it was possible that the advertiser was not responsible for acts of the sign painter, whose relationship to the advertiser had not been established.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer had made inquiries to determine whether it could employ the alternate method of payment under &sect; 105-113.56A, but was informed that such method was unavailable. Throughout the period in question, the taxpayer continuously paid the tax pursuant to &sect; 105-113.51, and made no other effort to comply with the alternate method. The taxpayer maintained that it could not have utilized the alternate method without violating North Carolina law, incurring civil and criminal sanctions, and involving itself in a constitutional lawsuit. The trial court held that the taxpayer was entitled to a refund. The court reversed. Section 105-266.1 was a procedural statute. It did not set out when a taxpayer was entitled to a refund, but only the steps by which a refund could have been obtained. The instances in which a refund was proper were a matter of substantive law and depended upon whether the tax payment was voluntary. The threat of civil or criminal proceedings was not sufficient coercion to constitute duress and make the taxpayer's payments involuntary. Moreover, the taxpayer had not paid the tax under protest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a juvenile, sought review of an order from the Lenoir County District Court (North Carolina), which denied his motion to quash a juvenile petition based on a city code under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-79 and denied his motion for a directed verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A store owner told a police officer that defendant and another boy were being loud and using strong language in the store and had refused to leave when asked. The officer, based upon the allegations, arrested defendant. A juvenile petition was filed against him, charging him with violating a city code. The trial court denied his motion to quash the petition, and it denied defendant's motion for a directed verdict. Upon review, the court reversed the trial court's orders. The court held that the petition did not plead the caption of the city code as required by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-79, and thus, the trial court should have granted defendant's motion to quash. The court determined that the trial court erred in denying defendant a directed verdict because the arresting officer did not have grounds to arrest defendant without a warrant. The court held that the officer did not have sufficient probable cause for the arrest under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-401(b)(2)b because the officer was not present when the complained of conduct occurred, and the officer had no reason to believe that defendant would not have been apprehended unless he was immediately arrested.</SPAN></P>

In its ruling, the court noted that the prosecution's argument was relevant in view of defendant's attack on the credibility and demeanor of that witness. In addition, the jury had the opportunity to observe defendant's size and build, and the prosecution limited its argument to those physical characteristics without otherwise characterizing defendant. The court declined to consider defendant's argument that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 14-72(b)(2), 14-54(a) were unconstitutional because he did not raise that point in the superior court. Section 14-54(a) made breaking or entering a felony if it was done with intent to commit any felony or larceny in the entered premises.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court, Buncombe County (North Carolina), which convicted defendant under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-72.2, in accordance with a jury verdict. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute, which criminalized the unauthorized taking, operating, or exercising control over a motorized conveyance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted under &sect; 14-72.2 after defendant, as agent of the landowners, removed two inoperable and apparently abandoned motor vehicles left by their owners on the landowners' property. The court vacated the conviction because the statute was unconstitutionally vague. To have removed the vehicles required that someone &quot;exercised control&quot; over them. If defendant removed the vehicles without consent of their owner, the statute was violated and defendant was subject to imprisonment. Yet so long as the vehicles remained on the land, the landowners were deprived of the lawful use of their property without due process. While the trial court had tried to explain to the jury that an landowner had a right to remove a motor vehicle off of his property, and that the purpose of the statute did not proscribe such action, such instruction did not comport with the statute's language. The statute as enacted did not include &quot;carrying away&quot; the motor vehicle of another as an essential element, so that the mere exercise of control over the conveyance of another without the consent, regardless of the circumstances was criminal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner purchased the property and moved onto the property in March 1947. The property owner's first notice of any claims against the property was on June 10, 1968, when he was served with the remaindermen's complaint. The property owner made significant improvements to the property and paid the property taxes from 1948 to the time of trial. The remaindermen lived in the area, knew that the property was occupied, had the opportunity to observe the extensive improvements to the property, and did not pay any property taxes on the property. The remaindermen alleged that they could not bring their action until after the death of their mother, the life tenant. The court held that the evidence clearly indicated that the remaindermen negligently omitted to bring their action for an unreasonable length of time to the prejudice of the property owner. Although the remaindermen brought an action against other property immediately after the death of the life tenant, they did not bring the current action until three years after the life tenant's death.

The court found the trial court failed to give a separate final mandate as to each defendant or otherwise clearly instruct the jury that the guilt or innocence of one defendant was not dependent upon the guilt or innocence of the other. The court ruled that the proper instruction was not accomplished when the trial judge in his charge to the jury merely read the separate bills of indictment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board dismissed the teacher on the basis that he had neglected his duties.

The trial court found that he was dismissed without the proper procedural safeguards, and the board appealed. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court order and reinstated the board's dismissal order. The court found that the board's participation in two stages of the suspension process under &sect; 115-142 did not result in a violation of the teacher's due process rights, because it did not present a biased element in the adjudication process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner State appealed an order of the Granville County District Court (North Carolina) dismissing the rehearing under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 122-58.11 and releasing respondent juvenile from commitment for mental illness. The juvenile division of the trial court held that it lacked statutory authority to directly commit respondent under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-286 (amended 1971) upon the certification of two doctors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both parties agreed that respondent needed treatment for mental illness. Under a prior statute, the trial court judge did have authority to commit a delinquent minor such as respondent. Currently however, the trial court judge lacked authority to directly commit respondent to a state mental institution under N.C. Gen. Stat. 7A-286 (amended 1971) and lacked jurisdiction. Thus, the trial court's order was void. Since the trial court lacked jurisdiction and the district court was mandated under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 122-58.11 to hold rehearings on all involuntarily committed patients, the district court properly ordered that respondent had been improperly committed. The court affirmed her release until the commitment was correctly made. The statute was unambiguous in its prohibition against the trial court's direct commitment of a child and there was no need to make any inquiry in the legislative intent of the statute. After treatment was determined to be in the best interests of the child, voluntary admission could be arranged with the parents' consent. If the parents refused, the court could appoint a guardian, who could act in loco parentis and voluntarily admit the child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a physician, contended on appeal that the North Carolina Controlled Substances Act, N.C. Gen.

The court further held that a practitioner who distributed drugs other than for a legitimate medical purpose within the normal course of professional practice had no more exemption from the law than did an illicit street vendor and that the challenged statute gave every practitioner fair notice of the standard he had to follow if his conduct was to come within the exception of the statute.

Since this was the only evidence of who was driving, the arrest of defendant was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the conviction, finding no error. The questioning of defendant was necessary for the purpose of preparing the official accident report that was required to be filed. The questions were investigatory and not accusatory. The Miranda warnings were only required when a defendant was being subjected to custodial interrogation. There was no error in not allowing defendant's motions for nonsuit or her motion to set aside the verdict. Defendant's arrest was not illegal. An unlawful arrest may not be equated, as defendant sought to do, to an unlawful search and seizure.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondents contended that North Carolina's involuntary commitment statute,&nbsp;N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 122-58.1 et seq. was unconstitutional. Respondents argued that the definitions of &quot;mental illness&quot; and &quot;inebriety&quot; found in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 122-36 were vague and arbitrary. On appeal, the court affirmed the commitment of two respondents. The court found that the definition of &quot;mental illness&quot; as provided by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 122-36(d) was capable of being understood and objectively applied with the help of medical experts. The court determined that the definition was not vague and arbitrary because the same definition had previously been held constitutional. The court noted that an overt act was not required to establish imminent dangerousness. The court stated that the evidence of inability to care for self and to cope with daily living was insufficient to support a finding of imminent dangerousness for two respondents because such evidence failed to present clear, cogent, and convincing evidence of imminent danger. The court concluded that the other respondents' objections to findings of mental illness and imminent danger were abandoned because they set out no supportive arguments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondents, a state department of transportation and highway safety and a state highway patrol, sought review of a judgment of the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina), which reviewed under N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 143, art. 33, their discharge of petitioner employee as a member of the state highway patrol.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee did not contend that any of his constitutional rights had been violated but that certain regulations of the policies and procedures manual of the state highway patrol were unconstitutionally vague. He contended that respondents had no basis to discharge him. The court found that the employee was not a public official elected for a specific term, nor was he under contract with respondents to work for any specified duration, and that he had no constitutional right to continue employment as a member of the highway patrol. The court found that no statute in North Carolina conferred upon the employee tenure or the right to judicial review of an administrative action terminating his employment. The court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 143, art. 33 did not contemplate judicial review of a simple administrative action such as the discharge of an employee but contemplated a determination of rights and duties of persons subject to the regulatory authority of the agency. Because the employee did not have a constitutional right to an agency hearing prior to his discharge, respondents' action was not subject to judicial review and their motion to dismiss should have been allowed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed a judgment of the Cumberland County Superior Court (North Carolina), which ruled that the statute under which defendants were charged, N.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were transporting their respective gallons of whisky in an automobile when they were stopped and arrested for violating N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18A-26(a), which provided that a person could not transport a gallon or more of an alcoholic beverage. The trial court declared the statute unconstitutional, finding that there was no reasonable basis for the requirement of provisions of &sect; 18A-26. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that there existed a reasonable basis for distinguishing transportation of alcoholic beverages in a for-hire passenger vehicle from other modes of transportation. There were significant differences present in the transportation of alcoholic beverages owned by passengers traveling in a for-hire passenger vehicle and transportation in private vehicles. The for-hire vehicle had to serve anyone who demanded a ride, and the driver had no authority to inspect the contents of passengers' baggage to determine if there were possible violations of the State's liquor laws. A person owning or operating a private vehicle had a choice to allow a rider or not and to require him not to bring particular items with him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the charges. The court found that the state offered the testimony of the arresting officer concerning defendant's conduct, appearance, and performance of tests. The arresting officer also testified that based upon his observations he was of the opinion that defendant was under the influence of alcohol. The state offered the testimony of the officer who administered the Breathalyzer to defendant to the effect that defendant's blood alcohol content was 0.14. This evidence was sufficient to overcome defendant's motions to dismiss. Defendant also claimed that because of the lapse of time between the arrest and the performance of the Breathalyzer test, the results of the test should not have been allowed in evidence. The lapse of time between the arrest and the Breathalyzer test was only 50 minutes. The delay did not render the test inadmissible. The court held that the prohibition against driving upon the public highways when the amount of alcohol in one's blood is 0.10 percent or more by weight contributed in a real and substantial way to the safety of other travelers and was a constitutional exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

The court then noted that only those searches and seizures that were unreasonable were prohibited by the Fourth Amendment. Where police officers had a warrant authorizing the search of a vehicle or premises it was reasonable to permit a search of persons found in the vehicle or on the premises, within the restrictions of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-256, to prevent those persons from concealing the contraband subject matter described in the search warrant. Where probable cause to believe that a drug was kept or concealed on certain described premises was established to the satisfaction of a proper magistrate, the search of a person found on the premises in the execution of a search warrant was not only reasonable, but necessary to secure effective enforcement of the Drug Act. The motion to suppress was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, a sheriff and a board of county commissioners (collectively county), challenged a judgment from the Harnett County Superior Court (North Carolina), which pursuant to plaintiff health club's action challenging the revocation of its license, concluded that an ordinance was invalid because it violated N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court held that the ordinance, whereby the sheriff revoked the health club's license, was invalid. Specifically, it found that the ordinance violated N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19 because no person could be deprived of his property except by due process of the law. A license to engage in an occupation was a property right, which could not have been revoked without both notice and the opportunity to be heard before a competent tribunal. The county appealed. The court affirmed the judgment. The ordinance at issue attempted to commission the sheriff as a special tribunal to conduct hearings on alleged violations of the ordinance. However, the court found that the provisions for revocation of licenses after a hearing before the sheriff did not afford the constitutionally required opportunity to be heard or defend in a regular proceeding before a competent tribunal. Accordingly, the trial court correctly concluded that the clause violated the North Carolina Constitution in that it would have allowed licenses to be revoked without due process of law and contrary to the law of the land.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff filed an action against defendant regarding the authority to levy taxes and allocate those funds to the support of educational institutions in the county. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of plaintiff, and defendant appealed the decision contending that it was erroneous. Defendant specifically argued that the jury, which was drawn from a different county, was incapable of properly deciding tax issues that did not affect them because they were not residents or citizens of the county to which the tax levy was applicable. The court noted that the trial court was within its authority, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 9-12, to order jurors from another county to ensure a fair trial. Furthermore, the thrust of defendant's argument was constitutional, and was not raised on appeal. Since the court did not consider constitutional questions not preserved for review, and the jury was not able to pass on political issues, the court deemed the judgment proper.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 1-75.4(5)d, which was part of the North Carolina &quot;long arm&quot; statute,&nbsp;N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-75.1 et seq.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to a contract executed between the parties at the corporation's offices, the supplier shipped cylinders from its North Carolina warehouse to the corporation. The supplier thereafter filed an action against the corporation in the trial court. On appeal, the corporation argued that &sect; 1-75.4(5)d did not apply because there was no showing that it had ever ordered or directed the shipment of cylinders. It also asserted that the imposition of in personam jurisdiction would violate its due process rights. In reversing, the court held that the corporation was subject to the provisions of &sect; 1-75.4(5)d, which allowed long arm jurisdiction to be used in any action that related to goods shipped from the state under a defendant's direction. The supplier had alleged that the company had directed the shipment of the cylinders; the allegations were unchallenged. Due process required that a foreign defendant have a certain amount of minimal contacts with the state. The requisite amount of contact was not shown. The contracts were negotiated, agreed to, and performed outside of North Carolina; the company did not maintain any offices or solicit any business in the state.</SPAN></P>

The attorney said he was fighting for social change, that he was a nonviolent person, and that he hoped his remarks would lead to some sort of unspecified growth. The court held that due process requirements of notice and an opportunity to be heard were met. The attorney received actual notice of both the hearing and the charges. The attorney contended that he was entitled to have an unbiased judge rule on the contempt charge, and that it was error for the trial judge not to recuse himself. The court held that the judge showed no bias. There was no evidence that the trial court invited the remarks. That the attorney knew his remarks were contemptuous was reflected by his statement that it would not worry him to be held in contempt.

The trial court held that &sect; 31A-5 was unconstitutional because it allowed the wife to gain an interest in a tenancy in the entireties by murdering her husband that she would not otherwise be entitled to if he were still living. Such a result, the court reasoned, violated the equitable principle followed in North Carolina that a person should not be permitted to benefit from his own wrong. The court affirmed the rest of the trial court's judgment but held that it erred in declaring &sect; 31A-5 to be unconstitutional. The language of &sect; 31A-5 was clear. It was the duty of the courts to carry out the legislative intent, regardless of any opinion that they might have as to the statute's wisdom. Section 31A-5 did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment because tenancies by the entireties were a purely voluntary method of acquiring and retaining realty.</SPAN></P>

The permittee filed a petition in the superior court, seeking a review of the Board's decision, asserting that the agents' entry on its premises violated the Fourth Amendment because they had no warrant and did not first seek and gain permission to enter the permittee's premises. On appeal, the court held that the regulation of the liquor industry was strictly a state matter and that pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 18A-19(c) and 18A-20(b), the agents had the right to enter the permittee's premises in the performance of their duty, at any hour of the day or night, without a warrant.

He had neither alleged nor offered proof that he occupied with respect to those questions any status legally different from that of all other citizens and taxpayers of the State. That he was an attorney at law actively practicing his profession in the State was not sufficient to give him standing such as to authorize the trial court to interpret for him or to determine the validity of any statute that he chose to question.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff State, on relation of a hospital, appealed a judgment from the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina) that granted defendant, a criminally ill patient, summary judgment in the State's action to require defendant to pay for the costs of his care. The trial court determined that N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 143, art. 7 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with the first-degree murder, and he was admitted to the hospital under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 122-91. When defendant was deemed competent to stand trial, a jury returned a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. The State later filed an action to recover the costs associated with defendant's commitment. On appeal, defendant claimed that N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 143, art. 7 violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and N.C. Const. art. 1, &sect; 19. The court agreed with the State's contentions that charging defendant for the costs of his care, treatment, and maintenance was not a tax and was not violative of his federal and state constitutional rights. The hospital did not have unbridled authority to determine what amount was paid and under what circumstances. N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 143, art. 7 set forth adequate standards from which the hospital could ascertain the charges against a patient, and it was not an impermissible delegation of power to the hospital. The statutory cost of the care, treatment, and maintenance was placed on all patients, both those civilly and criminally committed, and did not impose a non-uniform tax.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State challenged a judgment from the Robeson County Superior Court (North Carolina), which allowed defendant's motion to quash warrants upon the grounds that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-288.4, the statute under which they were charged, was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants contended that &sect; 14-288.4(a)(4)a, setting out certain elements of &quot; disorderly conduct,&quot; was interdependent with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-288.1(8), defining &quot;public disturbance,&quot; and that when both provisions were read together the average citizen was not given adequate notice of the conduct prohibited. Therefore, defendants successfully argued that the statutes were void for vagueness. On appeal, however, the court reversed the trial court's judgment. Specifically, the court first held that even a casual reading of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-288.4(a)(4)a, considered independently of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-288.1(8), made it clear as to exactly what specific disorderly conduct was prohibited by the statute. Thus, the court held that the warrants in the case clearly and expressly charged that defendants engaged in exactly the conduct outlined in the statute. Secondly, the court held that the validity of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-288.4 (a)(4)a did not depend upon the enactment by the legislature of detailed guidelines for the guidance of the specified school officials in the exercise of their responsibility to control the use of the buildings and facilities under their care.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A power company brought an action to enforce their statutory right to enter upon certain land for the purpose of making a survey of a proposed route. The landowners filed a motion to dismiss for failure to join necessary parties or in the alternative, a motion to join such parties. Both motions were denied, and an order for preliminary injunction issued. Upon review, the landowners argued that a preliminary injunction would deny them due process because it would grant the company the relief prayed for in the complaint before a trial on the merits. The court held that Gen. Stat. 40-3 provided that corporations granted the right of eminent domain could at any time enter upon the land through which they desired to conduct the works authorized and lay out the same. Further, such a survey clearly was necessary before the company could undertake intelligent negotiations with the landowners for the purchase of the proposed route or institute eminent domain proceedings.
