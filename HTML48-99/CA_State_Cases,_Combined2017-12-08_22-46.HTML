</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California, which convicted him of violations of Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 211, 212.5(b) for robbery of a person immediately after the victim used an automated teller machine and while he was in the vicinity of the machine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of robbing a victim who had just used an automated teller machine (ATM), in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 211, 212.5(b). The court held that &sect;212.5b was not unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the phrases &quot;in the vicinity of an automated teller machine&quot; and &quot;immediately after&quot; provided sufficiently definite notice that no reasonable person could misunderstand their meaning. Both phrases had common dictionary meanings, their usual definitions were easily understood, and they gave sufficient warning to defendant that robbing someone who just used an ATM was first degree robbery. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support appellant's conviction because defendant's ignorance of his victim's ATM use did not negate criminal intent. The court found that &sect; 211 defined the crime and &sect; 212.5b merely prescribed a greater punishment if ATM use was involved. The court held that, if knowledge were required, a police officer's testimony that he saw defendant's getaway car parked near the bank provided sufficient evidence that defendant was waiting for someone to use the ATM in order to rob him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for robbery of a person who had just used an ATM. The statute providing for increased punishment when ATM use was involved was not unconstitutionally vague. Defendant's ignorance of his victim's ATM use did not negate intent because ATM use only increased the gravity of the offense. Evidence that the getaway car was parked at the bank was sufficient to show intent to rob someone after they used the ATM.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of San Mateo County (California), which ruled in favor of plaintiff taxpayers in plaintiffs' cause of action to obtain tax refunds for the imposition of a parcel tax by defendant. Plaintiffs argued the parcel tax violated Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant city discovered a shortfall in revenue, they took action to impose a new parcel tax on all real property owners. Plaintiff taxpayers made administrative claims for tax refunds to defendant, which defendant declined to grant. Plaintiffs then brought a cause of action to obtain refunds for the imposition of the parcel tax. The trial court held in favor of plaintiffs. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed judgment for plaintiffs because the trial court had correctly ruled that defendant had unconstitutionally imposed and collected a property tax not apportioned according to value, as was required by Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 1. The court found that the tax was not an excise tax because it simply taxed property owners for the mere ownership of property, and was not imposed as a valid excise tax would be on any of the incidents of ownership, such as sale, transfer, rental, and special use of certain city services. The court held that those persons who had been unconstitutionally required to pay this tax could sue in a class action for the refunds they were entitled, where each plaintiff had filed a valid individual administrative claim for a tax refund from defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court in favor of plaintiff taxpayers because the parcel tax imposed by defendant city was not a proper excise tax, instead it was a property tax that was not apportioned according to value as was required by the California constitution. The court also held the trial court did not abuse its discretion in treating the action as a class action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, city council and agencies, sought review of an order that ruled in favor of respondent resident, denying appellants' motion to modify a stipulated judgment validating a business district redevelopment plan. Appellants' motion invoked the equitable jurisdiction of the trial court, asserting that changed circumstances had rendered the fiscal cap inequitable, but the trial court properly asserted a lack of jurisdiction for such an in rem proceeding, which operated against property, not persons, and was not modifiable as an injunctive order. Appellants asserted that the part of the plan imposing the fiscal cap and debt deadline did not concern the validity of the plan, was not an integral part of the stipulated judgment, and could be modified. However, without the substantive, not merely procedural, limitations, there would never have been a stipulated judgment, so those limitations were inextricably intertwined with the plan's validating language and could not be severed. Subsequent legislation also required the imposition of precisely such restrictions on redevelopment plans. The order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order in favor of respondent resident was affirmed. The court concluded that the trial court's ruling was proper, because the stipulated judgment was binding and conclusive, and the fiscal cap and time limit were integral parts of the judgment and not modifiable. Appellants could not unilaterally change terms or collaterally attack the judgment with respondent resident.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment for respondents but on appeal the court reversed the judgment and remanded for a declaration that &sect; 6070 was unconstitutional and for an injunction ordering the reinstatement of appellant to active membership. The court found no rational basis for exempting certain members from the mandatory requirement and no persuasive record of support for the exemption theory.

The trial court relied on Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1054.3 and exempted any attorney work product. The statute distinguished reports from statements and required disclosure of both. Self-recorded electronic statements were statements even though they were not heard or interpreted by anyone else. Raw written notes of witness interviews were witness statements, regardless of whether they were used to prepare a report, and were not drafts expressing the report writer's thought processes. Defense must disclose interview notes to the prosecution. The court held that compelled disclosure to the defense of raw written notes of police and prosecutors' witness interviews was also required. The impressions or opinions of the interviewer, regardless of whether the notes were used to produce a formal written report, were exempt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff litigant filed a lawsuit against defendant bank, alleging malicious prosecution and seeking to quiet title to certain realty. A trial court declared plaintiff a vexatious litigant and dismissed his action. Plaintiff appealed the trial court's order. The court affirmed the trial court's order, rejecting plaintiff's novel constitutional challenges to the vexatious litigant statute,&nbsp;Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 391 et seq. Plaintiff's five previous losing lawsuits, combined with the fact that he filed another suit which was found to lack merit, supported the reasonable inference that plaintiff was using the court system inappropriately, and would continue to do so. The fact that the statute did not require that the five losing lawsuits be frivolous did not render it unconstitutional. The court concluded that the vexatious litigant statute did not impermissibly chill the right to petition and did not penalize the filing of unsuccessful, colorable lawsuits. The court concluded that the trial court's prefiling order did not constitute an unlawful prior restraint of plaintiff's right to petition, nor violate due process. Plaintiff's claims regarding writs of habeas corpus failed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted respondent a nonsuit, and appellant sought review. The court reversed and found no probable cause for respondent to have brought the initial action because the initial action had not been objectively tenable. The court found respondent's initial action had not been objectively tenable because appellant's accusations and comments had been clearly protected by the right to petition guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged their convictions for deliberate and premeditated attempted murder arising out of a drive-by shooting. Defendants claimed that the shooter was someone in the back seat, so the prosecution argued that they were liable for attempted murder as aiders and abettors. The real question was not whether the actual offense was a consequence of the target offense, but whether the charged crime was a consequence of the aider and abettor's facilitation of the target offense. Assuming the jury found that defendants knowingly and intentionally aided and abetted the discharge of a firearm from a vehicle, it still had to determine whether attempted murder was a natural and probable consequence, which required it to consider whether it was reasonably foreseeable that the perpetrator harbored an intent to kill. A driver or owner could be held criminally liable either for affirmatively assenting to, or for failing to prevent, the discharge of a firearm from a vehicle, and an aider and abettor could be subject to life imprisonment for willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder even if he or she did not personally deliberate or premeditate. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. The court found no prejudicial error. Even if defendants did not discharge the firearm, they could be held criminally liable either for affirmatively assenting to, or for failing to prevent, the discharge.</SPAN></P>

Respondent tax board issued an order to withhold personal income tax, directing the insurer to withhold the amount of tax owed by appellants from any payments due them. Respondent denied appellants' claim that the award was exempt because it represented an award for disability payments and compensation for mental anguish. The trial court denied appellants' petition for writ of mandate. The court upheld the decision because the statutory scheme did not provide for exemptions to tax debtors when enforcement was pursued by a notice to withhold. It traced the evolution of the statute and determined that the prior statute did not contain the words &quot;notice to withhold.&quot; Although the statute was amended to provide exemptions in cases where a warrant or notice of levy was issued, it was not amended to provide an exemption when enforcement was by way of a notice to withhold, and that the legislature was aware it was not expanding the law to permit a tax debtor to claim exemptions when enforcement was via a notice to withhold.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant board of equalization challenged a judgment awarding respondent retailer a refund of use tax and interest. The trial court concluded that gifts of stock-in-trade and promotional literature made to out-of-state donees fell within the exclusion from use tax under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 6009.1. The trial court's judgment was reversed. Respondent conceded that a gift was a use, so it was subject to use tax if the gift was made in-state, whether or not a use of any other kind was made. Respondent did not show that the mutual credits provided by California and other states for sales and use taxes would not adequately protect against multiple taxation. State use tax was deemed to be due if the property was purchased without payment of sales tax and then delivered to a common carrier for transportation to a donee either inside or outside the state. Respondent's purchase of merchandise using resale certificates with the intent of giving the merchandise away was improper. Sales tax was owing on any sale of merchandise that was not purchased for resale. It was immaterial that respondent later gave some of the literature away out-of-state rather than in-state.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the willful failure to file the required form could be found only if the defendant knew that he was obliged under the law of taxation to file the form. Further the court found that there was nothing in the evidence which supported an inference that defendant's failure to file a personal income tax return was not &quot;willful&quot; in the required sense. The court affirmed the trial court holding that there was no requirement to instruct on mistake of law as to the failure to file an income tax return because there was no evidence upon which a jury could have found a reasonable doubt under this theory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant governor of California sought review of a judgment by Superior Court, Sacramento County (California), which granted respondent Board of the California Public Employees' Retirement System judgment on respondent's claims that two state senate bills that were passed by the legislature to balance the budget and changed the manner in which the retirement system was funded constituted an impairment of contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The California legislature, by two senate bills, changed the manner in which the California Public Employees' Retirement Fund (PERS) was funded. The rationale behind the change was to balance the state budget. Respondent PERS Board of Administration filed suit against appellant governor, arguing that the funding change constituted a violation of the constitutional right to be free of impairment of contracts. The trial court found for respondent, and appellant sought review. The court affirmed, holding that the change in funding constituted an unconstitutional impairment of contract. The court stated that state employees had a vested contractual right to pension benefits, and that the right to such benefits accrued upon acceptance of employment. The pension right could not be destroyed without impairing a contractual obligation of the employing entity. The court further held that state employees had a contractual right to an actuarially sound retirement system. Appellant argued that balancing the budget was a valid reason for changing funding. The court disagreed, stating that any change in the funding of the retirement fund had to bear some relation to its successful operation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of judgment to respondent retirement system board, holding that the passage of senate bills to balance the budget impermissibly constituted an impairment of a contract. The court held that state employees had a vested contractual right to pension benefits when employment was accepted, and that such a pension right could not be destroyed without impairing the contractual obligation of the employing entity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of the County of Humboldt (California), convicting him of possession of a firearm by one previously convicted of a misdemeanor assault in violation of Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded no contest to a charge of misdemeanor assault in 1987. Defendant was consequently convicted of various offenses, including possession of a firearm by one previously convicted of a misdemeanor assault in violation of Cal.

Const. art. I, &sect; 9, protected him from prosecution under the statute. The court affirmed the conviction. The court found that applying &sect; 12021(c) to defendant did not violate constitutional ex post facto principles because defendant was convicted based on conduct occurring after the effective date of the statute. The court found that the statute did not disadvantage defendant because it did not change the punishment for the original crime. Defendant's &quot;inability&quot; to petition for restoration of his right to possess firearms was speculative at best and did not invalidate his conviction.</SPAN></P>

He became fixated with the victim. After being warned to make no further contacts, he refrained from contacting victim for 12 years. After he quit taking his medication, he made contact and was subsequently arrested and convicted of stalking. The court affirmed the conviction. It held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 646.9(a), was neither unconstitutionally vague nor overbroad because the term safety was commonly used and its use did not make the statute unconstitutionally vague and uncertain, and the statute's application was limited only to threats that posed a danger to society. The court held there was substantial evidence to support the conviction. It found that appellant's conduct conveyed a credible threat of his intent to cause fear in the victim because he insisted on maintaining contact although she clearly was attempting to avoid him and he had been warned away; his letters to her reflected his desire to engage in sexual acts which included elements of bondage or violence, and their being together for eternity; he sent the victim black roses; and he referred to his prowess with a rifle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant went to the home of his ex-wife's boyfriend, pointed a fully loaded gun at them, and threatened to kill them. Defendant forced his ex-wife to leave with him in his truck. Defendant was arrested following a police chase. Defendant was charge with kidnapping, burglary of an inhabited dwelling, threatening a crime, and evading an officer. At trial, defendant maintained that he merely wanted to talk to his ex-wife and did not intend to kidnap her. A jury convicted defendant and this appeal followed. Defendant argued that the threatening counts had to be reversed because some of the threats he made were conditional and therefore, did not violate Cal. Penal Code &sect; 422. The court disagreed and held that a threat subject to an apparent condition violated &sect; 422. An absolutely unconditional threat is only one of several means by which that end may be accomplished. The jury was properly instructed that defendant could not have been found guilty of a violation of &sect; 422 unless the threat was so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to the person threatened, a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for kidnapping, burglary, threatening a crime, and evading an officer because the lower court fully instructed the jury in the elements of the threatening a crime counts and made it clear that defendant could not be found guilty of a violation of the statute unless the prosecution proved an immediate prospect of execution of the threat.</SPAN></P>

The court refused to address the issue of whether the exemption statute was constitutional because appellants' conduct constituted conduct inimical to the health of residents receiving services, another ground for revocation. The court affirmed because appellants knew or should have known the patient required supervision, because they were aware of the patient's history of schizophrenia and of a previous assault, and thus the facility was not exempt from licensing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Fresno County (California), which required him to pay support arrearages pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 11350, subd. (a)(2), contending that the statutory requirement that he reimburse the state for amounts in excess of what was actually paid violated his due process and equal protection rights under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 subd. (a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father was a noncustodial parent whose child received Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) support. The state sought reimbursement from appellant for support expended, plus additional sums that would total the amount appellant would have been required to pay in child support. Appellant contended that the state action seeking more than the state had expended was an equal protection and due process violation under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 subd. (a), because it treated noncustodial parents differently, i.e., if the child had not received AFDC support, the state would not be able to seek any reimbursement, and could not seek reimbursement for sums prior to an order to show cause. On appeal, the court examined the state and federal statutory schemes, under AFDC, and held that because the support of needy children was a legitimate state purpose, the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA), Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 4800 et seq., was narrowly tailored and worked in conjunction with the controlling federal statute, the statute bore a rational relationship to the legitimate purpose, and was not unconstitutional as applied, and affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment requiring appellant father to pay child support arrearages, holding that because the statute was narrowly tailored, rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose, and was in compliance with federal reimbursement mandates, the trial court's judgment did not violate appellant's equal protection or due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sheriffs' association sought review from a judgment of the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), which entered summary judgment in favor of respondent county. Appellant brought a civil action against respondent for the warrantless video surveillance of a county jail office. Appellant contended that the videotaping was excessively intrusive and invaded their expectation of privacy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court determined that appellant sheriffs' association had no reasonable expectation of privacy. Appellant contended summary judgment was improperly granted to respondent county because the videotaping assertedly violated protections against unlawful search and seizure, violated statutory prohibitions against invasion of privacy, and constituted a tortious intrusion into their seclusion. The court affirmed the judgment. Balancing the institutional security interests against appellant's interests in this case, the court did not believe that appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy against being videotaped in the release office of the jail. The videotaping was not excessively intrusive because there was no audio recording and the sole intent was to record an act, not a confidential communication. The court also found that there was no offensive conduct supporting appellant's tortious privacy claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order, which entered summary judgment in favor of respondent county. The court did not believe appellant sheriffs' association had a reasonable expectation of privacy against being videotaped in the release office of the jail and the videotaping was not excessively intrusive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant church member was convicted of transportation of marijuana and possession for sale of marijuana and imposed probation.

The court held that the criminal laws under which defendant was convicted did not substantially burden his free exercise of religion under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000bb et seq., and the laws did not have to be supported by a compelling state interest. There was no interference with a tenet or belief that was central to religious doctrine.

Respondent California Department of Real Estate paid real party in interest from its real estate recovery account, and automatically suspended appellant's broker's license under Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 10475. The superior court denied appellant's petition challenging the revocation. The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that appellant's U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7(a) due process rights were not violated by the revocation of his license without a formal hearing. Applying a four-factor analysis, the court concluded that notice and an opportunity to provide written argument satisfied due process requirements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant consented to a search of his home, police found MDMA, or Ecstasy, marijuana, a loaded handgun, brass knuckles, paraphernalia related to MDMA sales, and cash. After defendant was convicted of possession of MDMA and sentenced to three years of probation and six months in prison, defendant appealed, contending that his prosecution was barred by the double jeopardy clause of U.S. Const. Amend. V, following the completed forfeiture of money and property in a related civil action. The court disagreed and affirmed. A presumption existed that in rem civil forfeiture proceedings did not result in punishment for purposes of the double jeopardy clause. That presumption could be rebutted by the clearest proof that an in rem civil forfeiture was so punitive either in purpose or effect as to be equivalent to a criminal proceeding. In this case, forfeiture served nonpunitive purpose of discouraging property owners from using or allowing use of property in illegal activity and, although forfeiture was linked in some instances to commission of criminal offenses, that fact alone did not constitute the clearest proof necessary to demonstrate that a proceeding was criminal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction and sentence for possession of methamphetamine under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11377, and unlawful possession of waterfowl under Cal. Fish &amp; Game Code &sect; 2002. The court affirmed and held that a fish and game checkpoint did not result in an unreasonable search or seizure under U.S. Const. amend. IV, but defendant's home detention sentence exceeded the trial court's jurisdiction, so the sentencing order was vacated. The convictions were affirmed because the court held that the checkpoint was only slightly intrusive in that it was designed with specific, legitimate guidelines in mind; its location and operational procedures were determined at the supervisory level, vehicles were stopped according to a neutral formula; and signs advised of the checkpoints. The court held that hunters had a reduced expectation of privacy in their gear and their take from hunting, so it was reasonable to detain hunters briefly, near hunting areas during hunting season, to inspect their licenses, tags, equipment, and any wildlife taken. The search was not pretextual and defendant consented to a search that led to the drugs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for unlawful possession of methamphetamine and waterfowl was affirmed but the order of home detention exceed the trial court's jurisdiction. The strong public interest in regulation of natural resources outweighed the slight intrusion caused by the stop at a properly administered checkpoint, defendant's detention was justified, and the vehicle search was legitimate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner representative was not licensed to practice law in California. Petitioner represented a claimant seeking workers' compensation benefits. Prior California statutes allowed unlicensed persons to represent workers before the Workers' Compensation Board of Appeals (WCAB), and to receive compensation. The workers' compensation judge denied petitioner's request for attorneys' fees, and the WCAB affirmed. On judicial review, petitioner argued that he was deprived his fundamental right to engage in his occupation. However, the court found that the relevant statutes had been amended, and that the clear aim of the amendments to Cal. Labor Code &sect;&sect; 4903 (a) and 5710(b)(4) was to control fraudulent claim practices by increasing professional and criminal penalties and actively investigating and prosecuting fraud, and that any deprivation was a valid exercise of police power. The court rejected petitioner's argument that the amendments denied him equal protection of the laws because there was nothing in the record to support those assertions, and petitioner did not have standing to challenge the statutes on behalf of applicants. The decisions of the WCAB were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, statutes that were amended to allow only licensed attorneys' to receive fees did not deny petitioner his rights of equal protection or due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent university, a state agency, decided to develop a 22-acre site on its campus. Appellants, the California Native American Heritage Commission, also a state agency, and several individual Native Americans, filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction to prevent damage to a Native American religious or ceremonial site located on public property pursuant to Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect; 5097.94 (g). The trial court granted appellant's motion for summary judgment, finding that the statutes authorizing respondents' actions were facially unconstitutional. On review, the court found that appellants lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute that authorized respondents' actions. Furthermore, the court found that the rights forwarded by respondent were personal rights designed to protect individuals from governmental violations of their constitutional rights; they were not designed to be used as leverage by one state agency in a dispute with another agency about the appropriate use of state-owned land. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner doctor filed an application for writ of mandate which sought to challenge an order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which denied petitioner an in camera hearing and file review of patients medical records pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1524(c) and denied petitioner's motion for a sealing order in a Medi-Cal fraud action filed against petitioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner doctor was suspected of Medi-Cal fraud and a search warrant was procured to search petitioner's residence and medical offices. Petitioner filed an objection to the search and seizure and a motion for a sealing order. The trial court issued a protective order and sealed the patients' files for 30-days. Petitioner filed an application for writ of mandate and a request to extend the 30-day stay. Petitioner argued that even though he was suspected of criminal activity, he was entitled to an in camera review pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1524(c). The court denied petitioner's application and held that petitioner did not have a statutory right to either a special master or a hearing because he was suspected of criminal activity. Further, the court held that the Medi-Cal patients had only a limited privacy interest in their records, and that there was no violation of this interest. The search warrant procedure used adequately protected whatever privacy interest the patients had in their medical information and therefore, the court held that the patient files specifically related to the fraud investigation must be unsealed and provided to the investigators.</SPAN></P>

The court held that petitioner did not have a right to an in camera hearing and file review because he was suspected of Medi-Cal fraud. The court also held that the privacy interest the Medi-Cal patients had in their files was not absolute and the state demonstrated a compelling interest in the medical records related to the fraud investigation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents', reverend and church, filed a complaint that alleged various torts against appellant religion leaders. The trial court awarded judgment in favor of respondents. On appeal, appellants' argued that the trial court lacked constitutional jurisdiction to decide the dispute because is was ecclesiastical in nature, that appellants' statements and actions were privileged under U.S. Const. amend. I, and that awarded punitive damages were excessive. The court held that the trial court had the power to decide the case because it did not decide any religious questions and all ecclesiastical inquiries had been determined by a Japanese court under a final and binding judgment. Appellants' U.S. Const. amend. I contentions were waived because appellants did not ask the court to apply the Sullivan test, New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686, 84 S. Ct. 710 (1964), or object to the fact that the Sullivan test was not used. The court reversed and remanded the judgment insofar as it awarded punitive damages because new case law was retroactively applied that required an inquiry of appellants' financial condition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, insofar as it awarded compensatory and declaratory relief in favor of respondents', reverend and church. The trial court reversed and remanded an award of punitive damages because a change in the law required evidence of appellant religious leaders' financial status before such an award could be granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county tax assessor sought review of a declaratory judgment finding Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 63.1(e)(4) constitutional. Under Cal. Const. art. XIII A, &sect; 2(h), real property could be transferred from parents to children without triggering a reassessment of the value of the property (the parent-child exclusion). Section 63.1(e)(4) retroactively extended the time period during which the parent-child exclusion could be claimed. On appeal, the reviewing court rejected appellant's argument that &sect; 63.1(e)(4) violated Cal. Const. art XIII, &sect; 6, which provided that the failure in any year to claim a classification which reduced a property tax amounted to a waiver for that year. The court found that the waiver provision in art. XIII, &sect; 6 applied to classifications filed annually. It did not apply to the parent-child exclusion, which is only claimed once. The court also found that &sect; 63.1(e)(4) did not amount to an unconstitutional gift of public funds given its valid public purpose. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, finding that the provision that retroactively extended the time period for filing the parent-child exclusion from reassessment was constitutional. It did not violate the California Constitution's annual waiver provision because it was a one-time exclusion. Nor did it violate the constitution's prohibition against making a gift of public funds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of Santa Clara Count (California), which denied defendant's demurrer to the state's petition for commitment as sexually violent offender pursuant to the Sexually Violent Predators Act, Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed a petition to commit defendant as a sexually violent predator pursuant to the Sexually Violent Predators Act (SVP), Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 6600 et seq. The trial court denied defendant's demurrer to the petition. On appeal, the court denied defendant's writ of prohibition and lifted the stay on proceedings. Defendant contended that the SVP violated constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto and double jeopardy. The court held that the statute was not penal in nature, but was a civil procedure for committing and treating persons representing a danger to society because of mental disorders. The court held that the law did not operate to increase punishment for the underlying crime, because the commitment was not based on a proven history of prior violent sexual acts. Defendant complained that the statute violated equal protection and due process. The court held that equal protection standards were met by requiring a finding of current mental disorder and present danger. The court held that the statute was specifically tailored to assure that only those most likely to engage in violent sexually predatory behavior could be committed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Sexually Violent Predators Act (SVP) did not violate ex post facto and double jeopardy protections. The court held that SVP was not unconstitutional on its face, and did not violate constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who constructed a levee in the bottom of a river running through his property without first obtaining a stream bed alteration agreement, was convicted under Cal. Water Code &sect; 13387(a)(4). The court held that defendant's conviction under the statute did not violate ex post facto principles because the statute was enacted prior to the acts with which he was charged. Defendant's due process rights were not violated because the jurisdictional determination language in the statute was not vague, defendant had no right to challenge the determination prior to trial, and defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced by the prosecution's delay in bringing the charges after evidence of his activities was destroyed because defendant was aware of the investigation beforehand. The state was not precluded from prosecuting defendant because 33 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1319(c)(2), 1251(b), portions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, provided for criminal penalties and did not preempt California law. Defendant could not have used the converted cropland exemption under 33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1344(f)(1)(A) as a defense because his activities did not qualify as part of an ongoing farming operation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment granting probation because defendant's prosecution under the water code did not contravene ex post facto principles and his rights to due process had not been violated.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner then sought a writ of mandate and a stay of the dismissal order. The court issued a peremptory writ of mandate and directed the trial court to vacate its order because the court concluded that the MDO's extended treatment provisions for parolees had no penal consequences because it was for treatment and protection of the public and was not punitive. The court held that because the MDO expressly required a civil hearing before involuntary treatment and was not punitive, it did not violate U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 nor Cal. Const. art I, &sect; 9's prohibition against ex post facto laws. Finally, the court found that because the proceedings were civil, petitioner had a right to appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant school district challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), which found that the imposition of a fee against plaintiff developers violated the monetary limit of former Cal.

The judgment also directed defendant county to cease requiring payment of these fees as a condition to issuing building permits and certificates of occupancy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1986, the legislature authorized school districts to assess fees on development projects to fund school facilities. In lieu of proceeding thereunder, plaintiff developers signed a funding agreement with the county and defendant school district. The agreement, denoting a specific area within the district, provided for issuance of bonds by the county and assessment of taxes to pay therefor. Subsequently, Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 65995.3 was passed, authorizing school districts to charge developers an additional dollar per square foot on residential building. Plaintiffs challenged defendant's resolution of the charge, claiming it was prohibited by the funding agreement, and that the total assessed exceeded the limit set by Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 65996. The trial court entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs, and directed issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate commanding defendant to refund the fees paid by plaintiffs. The court reversed and found that the assessment was specifically authorized. and that the statutory limit excluded amounts paid under the funding agreement. Defendant had satisfied the statutory requirement of making a determination of the need and reasonableness of the fee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment that overturned a fee imposed on plaintiff developers by defendant school district because the fee was authorized by statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to three counts of residential burglary and one count of receiving stolen property. The trial court found him guilty of a fourth count of residential burglary and also found true prior conviction allegations. The trial court held that defendant's plea established his prior burglary conviction. Defendant claimed that the trial court improperly applied Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667, the three strikes law, because his prior offenses predated the enactment of the law. The court affirmed the judgment on defendant's convictions, but concluded that that the credit limitation in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(c)(5) did not apply to terms imposed for offenses committed before enactment of the three strikes law. The prosecution also appealed the judgment, claiming that the court erred in staying a five-year enhancement for a prior serious felony conviction. The court agreed with the prosecution. The court remanded the matter to the trial court to reconfigure defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner prosecutor filed civil commitment petitions pursuant to the Sexually Violent Predators Act (SVPA), Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 6600 et seq., against defendants, here, real parties in interest. Defendants filed ex post facto demurrers to the petitions and the trial court sustained the demurrers and ordered defendants release, concluding that the ex post facto clause, Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, rendered the SVPA unenforceable as to all sex offenders whose crimes preceded enactment of the SVPA. Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of mandamus and the court granted the petition. The court found that the trial court, in ruling that the SVPA was unconstitutional, concluded that the authorized commitments constituted additional punishments in violation of the ex post facto clause. The court ruled that such findings could not be made with out factual information and could not, therefore, be answered as a matter of law on demurrer.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to defendant district attorney because he was entitled to absolute immunity from liability for his alleged deficiencies in training and supervising his employees. Defendants, employees of the district attorney, were entitled to summary judgment on the basis of immunity because their alleged violative conduct fell within the scope of their authority as employees of the district attorney. The court reversed the grant of summary judgment to the county because triable issues of material fact remained as to whether the district attorney was a policy maker for the county and whether his alleged conduct constituted an official policy or custom subjecting the county to liability under &sect;1983.</SPAN></P>

The trial court concluded that appellant had abandoned the child within the meaning of &sect; 7822 and declared that the best interests of the child would be served by termination of appellant's parental rights. Appellant sought review of the decision. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that subdivision (d), an amendment to &sect; 7822, which did not specify a period of time within which a birth mother was required to conclusively decide about an adoption, did not change the common law rule that if a birth mother refused to consent to an adoption within six months of the child's placement with the adoptive family, the child was required to have been returned to the birth mother immediately without any consideration of the best interests of the child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A homeowners' association (association) filed an action for damages arising out of construction defects. One of two general contractors and the developers (settling defendants) entered into a sliding scale or &quot;Mary Carter&quot; settlement agreement with the association. The trial court granted a good faith motion and ordered the association to proceed against the settling defendants as well as petitioners, general contractor and subcontractors, in the direct action. Petitioners sought review by writ of mandate of the trial court's action, claiming it was an abuse of discretion. The court denied the writ petition and held that petitioners' interests would have been adequately protected by disclosure to the jury of the settlement agreement terms as mandated by Cal.  Civ. Proc.  &sect; 877.5 (a), (b). The court found that allowing the settling defendants to remain in the direct action permitted the introduction of all relevant evidence and, thus, petitioners could have made motions to limit evidence. The court determined that, contrary to petitioners' contention, there was a justiciable controversy because the jury had to determine the extent of the damages and the existence of any liability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of receiving a stolen pickup truck in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 496(a). The truck was discovered in a search of defendant's premises after a policeman received permission to conduct the search from state parole authorities.

The next day the policeman learned that one of the vehicles he had seen on defendant's premises was reported stolen. The policeman included all the facts in an affidavit in support of a search warrant which was issued and resulted in recovery of the vehicle. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the parole supervisor was operating as a member of the &quot;law enforcement team,&quot; and because the record did not permit a determination that the parole supervisor's conduct was &quot;objectively reasonable,&quot; the prosecution had failed to prove that the violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV did not merit the sanction of exclusion. The second search, made with a warrant, was also invalid because it was based on information received from the prior unlawful search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Accordingly, we conclude that the provisions of section 12021, subdivision (c)(3) must be extended to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">all</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> those who committed qualifying misdemeanors at a time when the offenses were not listed in section 12021, subdivision (c), and thus did not subject them to a firearms prohibition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a convicted misdemeanant, sought review of a decision of the Appellate Department of the Superior Court (California), reversing a trial court's order granting him the right to request relief from the provisions of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12021(c)(1), which prohibited any person convicted of specified misdemeanors from possessing a firearm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a convicted misdemeanant, filed for relief from the provisions of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12021(c)(1), which prohibited persons convicted of specified misdemeanors from possessing a firearm. At the time of petitioner's conviction, his offense was not one of the listed misdemeanors in &sect; 12021(c)(1) but it was added by amendment later. Misdemeanants subject to the prohibition fell into three classes: peace officers convicted of certain offenses, any misdemeanant who was convicted before January 1, 1991, and misdemeanants who were convicted after January 1, 1991. Persons in the first two categories could have sought relief from the firearms prohibition pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12021(c)(3) but those in the third category, such as petitioner, could not. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the statute violated the equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7(a) because the classifications were not rationally related to a legitimate public purpose. The court extended the relief avenue provided by the statute to all those who committed qualifying misdemeanors at a time when their offenses were not listed in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12021(c).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order reversing the decision allowing petitioner, a convicted misdemeanant, to seek relief from a statute prohibiting him from possessing a firearm because the classifications set forth in the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in that they were not rationally related to any legitimate government purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The judgment is affirmed, but the matter is remanded for the trial court to state its reasons in the minute order for the dismissal of prior convictions in conformity with Penal Code section 667, subdivision (f)(2) and Penal Code section 1385.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which entered a judgment of conviction following his negotiated plea of no contest to possessing a controlled substance, with his admissions that he had one strike, per Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(b)-(i), and two prior felony convictions for which he had served separate prison terms, per Cal. Penal Code, &sect; 667.5(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In exchange for defendant's plea of no contest, allegations of two prior residential burglary strikes and two prior prison term enhancements were to be stricken. Defendant entered a plea and was sentenced to the second strike sentence he was promised. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and refused to set aside the plea agreement because defendant received the benefit of the bargain he negotiated, an eight-year sentence as a second strike offender rather than an indeterminate life term as a third strike offender, and the plea bargain accomplished everything defendant could have hoped for had the trial court exercised its own discretion. The court found that defendant's sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, and was not grossly disproportionate to the current offense, given his individual circumstances and criminal history. The court remanded for the sole purpose of permitting the trial court to indicate in writing in the minute order whether defendant's two prior residential burglary strikes were dismissed for insufficient evidence or in furtherance of justice, and, if the latter, to comply with the requirements of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1385.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's sentencing of defendant in accordance with the terms of a negotiated plea agreement because defendant was sentenced as a second strike rather than third strike offender, received the exact sentence he had negotiated, and the sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The court remanded so the trial court could state its reasons in the minute order for the dismissal of two prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 6600 et seq., of 10 prisoners, real parties in interest, who had been convicted of sexually violent felonies and were about to complete their criminal sentences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state petitioned to have 10 prisoners civilly committed as sexually violent predators under the Sexually Violent Predators Act (Act), Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 6600 et seq. The prisoners, real parties in interest, moved to dismiss the petitions on the basis that the Act was an ex post facto law as it allowed for physical confinement beyond the length of their criminal sentences. Respondent trial court dismissed the petitions, ruling that the Act was unconstitutional because it did not require amenability to treatment as a precondition to commitment, rendering the confinement punitive rather than curative. The state petitioned for a writ of mandate challenging respondent's dismissal. The court granted the peremptory writ, holding that the Act was not an ex post facto law. The court held that the Act was not retroactive because it did not increase the sentence for the prisoners' original sex offenses. The Act was not penal because it imposed a mental health commitment for a present diagnosed mental illness, which was that the predator would likely commit future sexually violent offenses. The court ruled that amenability was irrelevant to the predator determination.</SPAN></P>

It was stipulated that if the prior conviction was found true, defendant would be sentenced pursuant to the three strikes law. The trial court found the prior strike allegation to be true and sentenced defendant under the three strikes law. On appeal, the court affirmed because defendant expressly agreed to the imposition of a sentence under the three strikes law. Defendant's express agreement precluded a remand for the purpose of obtaining a lesser term by virtue of the striking of the prior offense because the trial court was bound to enforce the plea bargain and the appropriate sentence within the limits of the bargain.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a preliminary injunction against appellant. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that Proposition K, Escondido, Cal., Mun. Code &sect; 29-101 et seq., had not prohibited mobilehome park owners from charging prospective purchasers rents exceeding those permitted for current tenants. Proposition K, which regulated rents charged for space in mobilehome parks, was adopted by the voters of Escondido by a ballot initiative measure. The court found that Proposition K was intended to deal with rent increases for current tenants, not prospective tenants, and that Proposition K had not either expressly or impliedly provided for the continued regulation of rents at the current tenant's level upon sale or transfer of the mobilehome. The trial court properly enjoined appellant from enforcing Proposition K against respondent in situations involving prospective purchasers of mobile homes.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the Three Strikes law, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667, did not require that defendant's prior convictions be brought and tried separately. The court ruled that the Three Strikes law was not unconstitutional because the manner in which prior convictions were determined was not ambiguous, and defendant had adequate notice of the punishment to be imposed in his case. The sentence imposed by the trial court was not unconstitutionally disproportionate because it was not imposed solely for defendant's current offense, but was based on his status as a repeat offender.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in April 1994 with violations of Cal. Veh. Code &sect;&sect; 23152(a), (b), and &sect; 14601.1, for drunk driving and driving with a suspended driver's license, which occurred in April 1992. Defendant also admitted to Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23175, a penalty enhancement statute, of having been convicted on October 1992, January 1994, and February 1994 of drunk driving incidents. The court affirmed the trial court's convictions in part and reversed in part. The court concluded that the legislature intended &sect; 23175 to adopt the rule that penalties for subsequent offenses can be increased based on earlier offenses even if the subsequent offenses occurred before conviction on the earlier offenses. Based on this conclusion, the court reversed and held &sect; 23175&nbsp;unconstitutional as an ex post facto law as applied in this case because this case involved the increase of penalty due to events occurring subsequent to the crime.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeal concluded the trial court erred because respondent's vested rights could be impaired by subsequent police power enactments where reasonably necessary to protect the health and safety of the public. The determination of whether respondent had vested rights was to be made as of the time he applied for the building permit. The clear language of the San Diego County Zoning Ordinance &sect; 1019a showed it was intended to confer the vested right to have a building permit application reviewed and considered in light of the regulations existing on the date of application. A governmental entity could not, through contract or legislation, abdicate its police power.</SPAN></P>

The trial court's finding that appellant intended to abandon her child was not supported by substantial evidence. To the contrary, the court found that appellant asserted her refusal to consent to the adoption before expiration of period provided in &sect; 7822, and followed this refusal to consent with reasonable action to recover custody of the child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the release of appellant parents' minor son from juvenile custody, the trial court, pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect;903, granted respondent county recovery of the cost of child support provided to appellants' minor son during his confinement. Thereafter, appellants sought review, contending that such recovery was invalid because the trial court did not require respondent to itemize and prove the particular components of the support. On review, the court affirmed the judgments. The court found that respondent had complied with the constitutional limitations on governmental assessment of support from parents of juvenile court wards. The court noted that such assessments were constitutional in that parents could be required to reimburse the cost of support provided to children as distinguished from the costs of incarceration and that respondent no longer needed to affirmatively demonstrate the components of the charges or to itemize them. However, the court remanded for further proceedings for the trial court to order respondent to render an accounting of the costs of support to ensure compliance with the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of conviction from the Superior Court of Colusa County (California). Defendant also challenged the trial court's decision to enhance his sentence by three consecutive five-year terms for each serious felony conviction, and a one-year term for each of four prison term enhancements under the three strikes law, Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that defendant incurred three serious felony convictions pursuant to the three strikes law, Cal.

He was sentenced to a consecutive 19-year term consisting of a five-year term for each of the three serious felony convictions and a one-year term for each of the four-prison term enhancements. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in imposing five-year enhancements for the three serious felony convictions because the prosecutor failed to plead and prove them under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(a). The court found that defendant received notice of each fact required for imposition of an enhanced term under &sect; 667(a). Further, the requisite factual allegations to establish a serious felony conviction under &sect; 667(a) were both pleaded and proven. However, the court concluded that defendant correctly contended that his three serious felony convictions were not brought and tried separately under &sect; 667(a). Therefore, only one five-year term could be imposed. Accordingly, the judgment was modified to strike two of the five-year terms imposed under &sect; 667(a).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, private hospital and taxpayers, sought review of an order granting summary judgment in favor of defendant county.

Regarding the merits of the case, pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code. &sect; 14000.2, defendant was authorized by the legislature to treat paying patients at public hospitals. And, although defendant's policy of treating paying patients had the effect of creating competition with plaintiff private hospital, that policy did not exceed defendant's police power. Furthermore, that practice did not constitute a gift of public funds because the expenditure of money to promote health was an expenditure for a public purpose. Finally, the court held that defendant was not a person subject to suit under the Unfair Practices Act, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;17000 et seq., or the unfair competition statute,&nbsp;Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant administrator challenged a judgment favoring respondent surety company, which absolved respondent of liability for damage to a conservatorship estate by an attorney appointed to act as successor conservator for the estate. After the attorney was found to have embezzled from the estate property, appellant filed a claim for a surety bond issued by respondent. Respondent denied the bond on grounds that the appointment by the probate court of the attorney was invalid. Ultimately, the dispute was heard by the trial court which declared void the order appointing the attorney as conservator for the estate and rescinded the bond issued by respondent guaranteeing the attorney's performance. On appeal the court reversed, holding that the order appointing the attorney as successor conservator was not void and that respondent was precluded from challenging its validity. The procedural irregularities which occurred in the course of the appointment did not deprive the probate court of subject matter jurisdiction over the estate. Respondent manifested its consent to the procedure by which the attorney was appointed conservator and therefore was estopped from challenging the appointment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was hired as principal by respondent school district. This was his first employment by respondent, thus, he was a probationary employee. On March 11, 1994, respondent sent appellant a letter notifying him that it had determined not to reelect him; his employment was to terminate at the end of the academic year. In a separate letter, appellant was notified of a new assignment as a Principal on Assignment. Appellant immediately reported that he was sick and would be unable to return to work until July 3, 1994. The employment year ended June 30, 1994. Appellant filed a petition for writ of mandate alleging that he did not receive proper notice of his nonreelection or of his transferred assignment as required by Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 44951. The trial court found the statute to be inapplicable and denied his petition. The court affirmed, finding that respondent properly noticed appellant's non-reelection pursuant to Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 44929.21 because appellant was a probationary employee. The court found that Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 44951 did not apply and that respondent's notice of non-reelection was timely and provided appellant with the appropriate notice of his non-reelection.</SPAN></P>

The applicable statute section relating to appellant's non-reelection required notice by March 15. Respondent properly noticed appellant's non-reelection on March 11, 1994, and therefore, his non-reelection notice was timely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of carjacking, assault with a deadly weapon, robbery, unlawful vehicle taking, and possession of a firearm by a felon. In affirming the convictions, the court held that the crime of carjacking did not create a potential for the punishment of protected conduct. The reason for a special carjacking statute, with a penalty greater than that for second-degree robbery, was that carjacking was a particularly serious crime that victimized persons in vulnerable settings.  Cal. Penal Code &sect; 215 gave notice that it did not supplant Cal. Penal Code &sect; 211, and depending on the facts and the discretion of the prosecutor, a carjacking could result in charges of both carjacking and robbery. Section 215 was not void for vagueness because it defined the number of offenses committed when the vehicle was taken from both a possessor and a passenger. There was specifically no denial of equal protection because every similarly situated defendant charged with those offenses could face the same charging, convicting, and sentencing options.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's convictions, holding there was no impediment to convictions of carjacking and robbery that arose from the same act because neither was a necessarily lesser-included offense of the other. The court ruled that there was no denial of equal protection because every similarly situated defendant charged with those offenses could face the same charging, convicting, and sentencing options.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Co-defendants were convicted in the trial court on numerous charges in connection with an incident in which they possessed, transported, and then threw an explosive device at a third party, who was not injured. Defendants sought review, alleging first that their statements to the police should have been suppressed because they did not fall within the &quot;public safety&quot; exception to the Miranda rule. The court affirmed conviction, holding that the evidence of the explosion, the unknown nature of the devices found hidden under the car seats, and the necessity of further handling of the devices justified questioning defendants without first informing them of their Miranda rights. Defendants also argued their two-year prison term constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the state and federal constitutions. The court agreed and reversed the sentence. It noted that defendants testified they did not know the rockets were potentially destructive because they were small in size and they believed they were fireworks. Furthermore, defendants could have been prosecuted under a different statute that would have resulted in misdemeanor charges and probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Co-defendants' convictions on charges related to the explosive devices were affirmed because the police were justified in questioning defendants before complying with the Miranda rule; defendants' sentences were reversed and remanded because the mandatory two-year prison term constituted cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant elected state official appealed from a judgment of conviction and an order of probation entered by the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California) pursuant to Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant elected state official participated in the forming of state contracts in which he had a financial interest through the Department of Education, which financially benefited a non-profit organization employing his spouse.

Appellant challenged the conviction and order, contending that the trial court erred in its jury instructions, that the contracts were grants beyond the scope of the charged crimes, and that the Attorney General lacked authority to prosecute this action. The court affirmed the judgment and order, but remanded the cause directing the trial court to use its discretion in determining whether to impose restitution. The trial court fully and fairly instructed the jury on all elements of the charged offenses. There was ample evidence to support the transactions as contracts, not grants. The Attorney General was within his discretion to prosecute the action because he felt that state law would otherwise not be adequately enforced in any county.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. XVI, &sect; 18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant electors challenged the superior court judgment, which validated a lease-back financing arrangement to fund improvements to a stadium. The financing arrangement was being effected without a two-thirds vote of the qualified electorate as provided in the Cal. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 18. The arrangement included a ground lease, bond issuance, and a facility lease. Respondents filed an action in superior court seeking validation of the leases, bonds, and related ordinances and resolutions. The superior court held that respondents established that the lease fell within the well-established contingent-payment exception to the constitutional limitation on indebtedness of a city. The superior court also found that respondents were not constrained in the issuance of bonds by the provisions of the city charter. On appeal the court concluded that the provision allowing respondent agency to relet the stadium would not convert respondent city's obligation to pay rent into a prohibited debt under article XVI, section 18, when it was not previously a prohibited debt because respondent city continues to receive consideration. Judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant residents of a mobilehome park sought review of the decision rendered by the Superior Court of Ventura County (California) which entered judgment in favor of respondents in a case concerning rent regulation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case involved a failed attempt by appellant residents of a mobilehome park to convert the park to resident ownership and respondent owners' subsequent attempt to increase rents to the level allowed under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 66427.5. The trial court found that &sect; 66427.5 applied whenever a subdivider filed a tentative map to convert a rental park to resident ownership, even if the conversion did not occur. Thus, the trial court found that &sect; 66427.5 regulated rents at the park and preempted contrary provisions in an initiative. Accordingly, it entered judgment in favor of respondents, city, the park, and the park's owners and managers. The court rejected respondents' argument that appellants' claims were barred under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 66499.3 because they failed to challenge the tentative map within 90 days after its approval. The court also stated that respondents only raised a facial challenge to the initiative. They did not claim that the initiative had been applied in a manner that denied respondents a fair return on their investment. As a result, the record contained no evidence concerning respondent city's willingness to grant respondent park a rent increase.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of violating Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12280(b), possession of an unregistered assault rifle, and sentenced him to three years' formal probation. Defendant claimed that his weapon was not prohibited because, when correctly interpreted, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12276(a)(11) referred to an assault weapon manufactured with a detachable magazine. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that defendant's weapon was prohibited because the plain meaning of &sect; 12276(a)(11) indicated that it was applicable to an assault weapon with a detachable magazine, whether manufactured as part of the weapon or otherwise attachable. The court followed the plain meaning of the Assault Weapons Control Act, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12275 et seq., because the legislative purpose of restricting firearms with a high rate of fire and capacity for firepower was clear, and assault weapons were the evil the legislature had attempted to control. Because an ordinary person of reasonable intelligence, or anyone familiar with gun parlance, would have known that defendant's weapon was prohibited under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12276(a)(11), the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a reporter and news director of a local television station, challenged a judgment of the Santa Clara County Superior Court (California), holding petitioners in contempt for refusing to disclose their source.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a reporter and news director of a local television station, sought relief from contempt after they refused to disclose their source that provided information about a pending criminal prosecution in violation of a protective gag order. The action stemmed from a trial involving an accused killer charged with a child's murder. Respondent court issued a protective order prohibiting the release to the public of evidence that had not been ruled admissible and any comments about gathered evidence. Petitioners broadcast a report regarding accused's videotaped confession and details regarding the investigation. Petitioners argued that the shield law, Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, immunized them from contempt. Respondent court maintained that the contempt order was necessary to deter future violations and to protect accused's right to a fair trial. The appellate court granted petitioners' request for a writ of habeas corpus or certiorari and annulled the contempt judgment, because the shield law protected petitioners from contempt absent a specific showing that nondisclosure of the source created a substantial probability of injury to accused criminal's right to a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners, a reporter and news director of a local television station, were entitled to a writ of habeas corpus or certiorari, because the shield law immunized them from contempt based on their news media status. It was unlikely that the failure to identify petitioners' source would facilitate additional leaks to jeopardize the fairness of the accused's trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to 25 years to life for conspiracy to commit murder, with an additional year for an arming enhancement. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that the trial court properly declined to direct the jury to determine the degree of murder that defendant conspired to commit, because such a determination could have had only one legally correct outcome -- first degree murder. The definition of murder included in the attempted murder instruction was sufficient to communicate the necessity of finding specific intent to kill and it was unnecessary to instruct on the mental states of premeditation and deliberation or to distinguish the implied and express malice charges. The court found that the trial court had no sua sponte duty to link its instructions on withdrawal and the burden of proof. The court held that withdrawal was not a viable defense because defendant had already completed the overt act of conspiracy when he agreed to kill a gang member, got into a stolen car with a loaded handgun, and attempted to enlist other gang members in the plan.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, remanding only to allow the trial court to determine whether or not to exercise its limited discretion to dismiss a &quot;strike,&quot; which the trial court was not aware it had discretion to do at appellant's sentencing. The court found that an evidentiary gap in the proof of whether appellant possessed cocaine base was closed by substantial evidence from an exhibit, admitted into evidence, and viewed by the jury, which contained not only the remaining rocks of cocaine but also the results of two tests performed by a chemist that were included in the chemist's admitted report.

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the terms &quot;serve no legitimate purpose&quot; read in context was comprehensible and that the statute prohibited certain, described conduct such that an ordinary person reasonably could understand what conduct was expressly prohibited. As to defendant's assertion that there was insufficient evidence to support an assault conviction on the infant, the court held that defendant's contention that he did not intend to harm the infant was without merit.

The court concluded the regulation did not constitute punishment within the meaning of the ex post facto clauses and although the regulation had a punitive effect and one of its purposes was penal, it also had a legitimate, nonpunitive governmental purpose of maintaining institutional security. The court reason that since family visits may be totally banned, the department necessarily had the authority to restrict participation in the program.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant accused made a pretrial motion to dismiss an allegation of a prior conviction being considered pursuant to California's &quot;three strikes law,&quot; Cal.

The trial court struck the allegation, from which plaintiff people appealed. On appeal, the court reversed the order because defendant failed to meet his burden of establishing that he improperly waived his right to a jury trial. The court held that if defendant was confused by the trial court's explanation of a jury trial, he was required to allege and prove his confusion. The court observed that state court defendants in noncapital cases were permitted to file a pretrial motion to strike prior convictions despite a federal decision abolishing that remedy as the federal decision did not apply to state courts. Thus, the court reversed and remanded, ordering that defendant be given an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea as to the cocaine charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband challenged a ruling by the Alameda County Superior Court (California), that it had jurisdiction under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband challenged the trial court's decision to exercise jurisdiction under Cal. Fam. Code. &sect; 4336 over a motion for modification of spousal support filed by respondent wife after the last date the original order required support to be paid. The court affirmed, concluding that the trial court had jurisdiction to proceed. The parties' 25-year marriage was dissolved in 1978; a stipulated support order filed in 1986 did not contain language expressly terminating support at a stated time but rather provided for a period of support and prohibited respondent from modifying its terms &quot;on or before&quot; the end of that period. The court held that the lack of a specifically demonstrated intention to preclude modification required a finding that the agreement was in fact modifiable after the specified date and that the trial court properly found jurisdiction under &sect; 4336.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment and remanded to the trial court. The court determined that, in the absence of any clear intention that the spousal support order could not be modified, the order was modifiable, and the trial court retained jurisdiction under the current statute to entertain respondent wife's motion for modification over the objections of appellant husband.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of Cal. Penal. Code &sect; 12021(a). Defendant argued that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that his prior conviction was a felony because the court's instructions removed determination of an essential element of the charged offense from the jury's consideration. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, but the state supreme court vacated the court's opinion. On reconsideration, the court again affirmed, finding that the trial court misleadingly and erroneously allowed evidence on the preliminary legal question of the felony status of defendant's prior crime to be presented before the jury. However, the court also found that the trial court did ultimately and properly determine the preliminary question of the felony status of the prior conviction itself, and that it also properly instructed on the legal status of that conviction as a felony. The court held that the instructions did not remove an element of the crime from decision by the jury, as the jury was called upon only to decide whether the felony conviction offered was in fact suffered by defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former husband sought to end his child support obligation to respondent former wife and their two minor children. During the course of dissolution proceedings, the court ordered blood tests to establish paternity, and appellant learned that he was not the biological father of either child. Appellant had acted as father to the children, while the biological father had not. The trial court denied appellant's request to terminate his obligation, pursuant to the presumption of parentage in Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 7540. On appeal, the court affirmed, and held that although the order for the blood tests did not occur until more than two years after the birth of the youngest child, the two-year statute of limitation provided in &sect; 7541(b) was applicable only to motions for blood tests brought by a husband, and not to those ordered by a court. The court also held that appellant had no constitutionally protectable interest in severing the parent/child relationship because the interest of the state in the welfare of the children, in promoting marriage, and not undermining the family unit, would not be served by allowing appellant to end his parent/child relationship with the children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The sentence in this case is reversed. The trial court is directed to impose a new sentence, consisting of an indeterminate term of 225 years to life, plus three 5-year enhancements or 15 years for the prior serious felony convictions under section 667, subdivision (a)(1).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), and claimed that his 225 years to life sentence was calculated incorrectly under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170.12(c)(2)(A)(iii). Defendant claimed that his sentence should have been calculated according to &sect;1170.12(c)(2)(A)(i), which would have amounted to a sentence of 48 years to life.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to 225 years to life for his 7 convictions of robbery and 2 convictions of attempted robberies. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in calculating his sentence. The court held that under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170.12(c)(2)(A), a three strikes defendant was to be sentenced to the greater of three options as the minimum term and the sentences were to run consecutively. Thus, under &sect; 1170(c)(2)(A)(iii), determinate sentencing rules were properly applied singularly to each current conviction and the aggregate term was not to be calculated. Further, multiple current felony convictions were to be combined, as opposed to considered separately, when calculating the mandatory minimum term. The court held, however, that defendant's current felonies were serious and he had three prior serious felony convictions under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(a)(1), and a life prior under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170.12(b) and (c), and thus the trial court was required to impose three five year enhancements. The court reversed the trial court's sentence as an unauthorized sentence, and directed the court to impose a new sentence consisting of an indeterminate term of 240 years to life.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found defendant's claims without merit because his calculations were based on a faulty premise and inapplicable statute. However, the court reversed his sentence as an unauthorized sentence, and directed the trial court to impose a new sentence, consisting of an indeterminate term of 225 years to life, plus three 5-year enhancements for defendant's prior serious felony convictions. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment because &sect; 12022.55 was plain on its face that all that was required was that death or great bodily injury be inflicted as a result of discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle. The court noted that the term &quot;drive-by&quot; did not appear anywhere and that defendant cited no language which remotely suggested that the vehicle must be in motion for the enhancement to apply. The court further held that defendant's argument would fail even if the court independently construed the legislature's intent, because although the court had no doubt that the gang-type drive-by shooting was one of the primary concerns in enacting &sect; 12022.55, there were other plausible purposes for the enhancement. namely, deterring persons from violent actions upon our public streets and highways.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The judgment is reversed with directions to enter judgment in favor of the city. In light of Bonner's having prevailed at trial, our earlier opinion giving him a chance at some recovery on his due process claim, and the fact the City of Santa Ana did not raise the dispositive point at trial, it is fitting that the parties bear their own costs on appeal. Obviously the argument in Bonner's cross-appeal that the trial court should have awarded him attorney fees falls with the loss of his two causes of action.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand from the California Supreme Court, plaintiff homeless person sought to establish that his equal protection rights and due process rights under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, had been violated by defendant city when defendant threw a bag containing plaintiff's possessions into the trash. The trial court had found for defendant. Plaintiff also sought attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homeless person stored his possessions in a trash bag, which was thrown away by defendant city's workers. Plaintiff sought damages based upon violations of his equal protection and due process rights under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. At trial, plaintiff prevailed and was awarded money damages. Defendant appealed, and the court reversed. Plaintiff then appealed to the state supreme court, which remanded the case to the court for further consideration. On remand, the court held that plaintiff was not entitled to money damages for a violation of the state due process clause. As there was nothing in the language or history of the state equal protection clause indicating voter intent to allow damages, plaintiff had no right to sue for money damages. As for plaintiff's due process claim, the court held plaintiff was not entitled to a direct constitutional claim or money damages. Thus, the court reversed the trial court's judgment with directions to enter judgment in favor of defendant. The court also ordered that the parties bear their own costs on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment in favor of plaintiff homeless person against defendant city because plaintiff was not entitled to money damages for a violation of the state due process clause or equal protection clause, given state case precedent and the legislative intent of state voters in ratifying the state constitution. The court further ordered that each party bear its own attorney costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant labor agency and plaintiff subcontractor both appealed a decision of the San Francisco Superior Court (California), which issued a writ of mandate setting aside defendant's notice to withhold underpaid wages and statutory penalties, under Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 1720-1780, from plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon learning that plaintiff subcontractor paid less than the prevailing wage to its employees on a public works project, defendant labor agency issued a notice to the contracting agency directing it to withhold statutory penalties and underpaid wages, in accord with the prevailing wage law, Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 1720-1780. On petition of plaintiff, the trial court held that the notice to withhold should not have issued until defendant labor agency had fixed the amount of the penalty. The court reversed and held that in Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 1727, which imposed upon the contracting agency the duty to withhold the wages and penalties which had been forfeited, the term &quot;forfeited&quot; did not require that the agency to have first actually perfected the forfeiture. The court stated that the moment the subcontractor violated the law by paying less than the prevailing wages, it rendered itself liable for the loss of, or forfeited, the penalties and underpaid wages. The court held that the awarding agency's power and duty to withhold penalties were thus predicated on a preliminary or tentative estimation of penalties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment setting aside the notice to withhold penalties and wages from plaintiff subcontractor, rendering moot plaintiff's appeal, finding that notice was proper because under the statute, defendant labor agency was not required to have first fixed the penalty before issuing an order to withhold underpaid wages and penalties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former husband was infertile, but not absolutely sterile, when respondent former wife had unprotected sexual relations with another man and became pregnant. After expiration of the statute of limitations for filing a notice of motion for blood tests, appellant filed for dissolution of the marriage. Respondent sought child support, based upon the presumption of paternity contained in Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 7540. The trial court rejected appellant's argument that the statutory exception based upon sterility should be broadly construed to include infertility. Affirming that decision on appeal, the court stated that because a broad interpretation of the sterility exception undermined the intent of the statute, it defined sterility in the strictest sense, that is, that the presumed father could not produce live sperm count. The court held that while application of the presumption might implicate due process concerns where no parent-child relationship had been established, application of the presumption to appellant's case did not deprive him of his right to due process, because appellant did not pursue such a claim in the court below, and had therefore waived the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment ordering appellant former husband to pay child support, holding that appellant's infertility did not fall within the sterility exception to the conclusive presumption of paternity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to appellant school district's adoption of a policy which prevented its employees from wearing political buttons at work sites during work hours, respondent teachers' union filed a petition for a writ of mandate as well as for declaratory judgment, attorney fees, and punitive damages. The trial court granted the writ and held that the policy violated U.S. Const. amend. I. The court observed that Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 7055 gave school districts the power to restrict political speech during work hours, but that such power was not unfettered. It also noted that schools had the power to dissociate themselves from political controversy. In striking a balance between appellant's right to dissociate from political activity and the constitutional rights of school employees to express their political viewpoints to one another, the court affirmed the grant of the writ but modified it and held that appellant's ban could be enforced in instructional settings but not in noninstructional settings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent university applied for a permit to construct a new business school. Appellant school district would not issue a permit unless respondent paid school development fees, pursuant to Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 53080. Respondent paid the fees under protest and then filed a petition for writ of mandamus. The trial court granted the petition. On appeal the court reversed, holding first that in enacting &sect; 53080, the legislature intended to include virtually all construction except that exempted by Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 65995 et seq, which applied only to purely religious and state entities. The court found that respondent and its business school were not purely religious in their activities and that respondent conducted commerce by exchanging money for tuition. The court also held that a statement that enrollment would be unaffected was inadequate to overcome the application of the fees. The court further held that the fees were not taxes so that respondent could not take advantage of tax exemptions under &sect; 65995 or Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 3. Finally the court held that it did not need to apply the essential nexus test for takings cases as it did not apply to development fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the school development fee refund to respondent university because the authorizing statute applied to all but purely religious and state entities, which respondent was not, the fees were not taxes so that respondent could not take advantage of statutory and constitutional tax exemptions, and development fees did not invoke full takings clause scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

Gov't Code &sect; 12940(h)(1), based on derogatory racial epithets directed towards them by appellant manager. After the trial court awarded verdicts to certain appellees, it awarded an injunction ordering appellant manager to refrain from use of racial comments. Appellants sought review of the injunctive portion of the judgment, claiming that the injunction violated the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 12900 et seq., the U.S. Const. amend. I and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 2(a). The court reversed the decision, holding that the injunction reached beyond the scope of FEHA, but ruled that the injunction did not violate the constitutional proscription against prior restraints because it targeted conduct that amounted to employment discrimination, not free expression. There was no direct restraint of free expression, and the injunction was directed at conduct rather than expressive activity. On remand, the trial court was directed to modify and narrow the injunction's scope and describe the prohibited conduct with further specificity.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 890-894, forgery, and filing a false instrument, and challenged the convictions, alleging that the rent skimming statute was unconstitutional, the statute of limitations had run, the search warrants were defective, and the jury was misinstructed. The court affirmed the judgment for all counts, but reversed for all but one count of rent skimming as to both appellants, because the acts were barred because they did not occur within three years of commencement of prosecution. The court held that the rent skimming statute was constitutional, because it criminalized the willful diversion of specific funds actually in the possession of the defendants and did not violate the constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debt. The court ruled that the jury was given proper instructions regarding rent skimming, because the trial court clearly stated that the diversion of rental revenue must have been willful. In addition, the court determined that the search warrants were valid, because they were reasonably relied upon by the officers and were not lacking in probable cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1979, the California Legislature established respondent California Kiwifruit Commission to deal with advertising, promotion, marketing research, and production research under Cal. Food &amp; Agric. Code &sect; 68005. Respondent was funded through an assessment upon kiwifruit handlers, pursuant to Cal. Food &amp; Agric. Code &sect;&sect; 68081(n), 68106. When respondent filed an action against appellant farmer for assessments due for the 1988-1992 marketing seasons, appellant defended on the ground the assessments were an unconstitutional infringement of his U.S. Const. amend. I freedom of speech and association rights. The trial court held in favor of respondent. On appeal, the court applied a strict scrutiny analysis to the assessment because such a standard of review was usually applied in cases involving associational rights. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, holding that the compelled contributions were not narrowly tailored to achieve the goal of promoting kiwifruit, and thus the assessments violated appellant's U.S. Const. amend. I rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homeowners appealed the order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which awarded summary judgment to defendants, humane society, city, and animal control officer, in plaintiffs' 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action on the grounds that defendant animal control officer's warrantless entry into plaintiffs' home to seize a dog was not a violation of U. S. Const. amend. IV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homeowners filed suit under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, claiming that defendants, humane society, city, and animal control officer, violated their rights under U. S. Const. amend. IV. Defendant animal control officer observed plaintiffs' dog roaming free in violation of the city's leash law. Defendant animal control officer later entered plaintiffs' residence while they were not home, without a warrant, and seized the dog. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on the ground that there was no constitutional violation. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the warrantless entry was unlawful. The court held that there were no exigent circumstances requiring entry because the dog did not present a danger, the infraction of the leash law was a minor violation, and there was time to procure a warrant. The court found that Pasadena Mun. Code &sect; 6.08.110, which authorizes animal control officers to enter premises where an animal running at large is kept and to seize it, did not dispense with the requirement of a warrant, and that defendant animal control officer was not entitled to qualified immunity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the award of summary judgment to defendants, humane society, city, and animal control officer, in plaintiff homeowners' civil rights action, because defendant animal control officer's warrantless entry into plaintiffs' home to seize their dog was unlawful under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution because no exigent circumstances existed.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 19382 and Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 32 provided the remedy of an action for refund, which disqualified plaintiff from seeking a writ of mandate since there was an adequate remedy at law. The court also dismissed plaintiff's contention that, because the limitations period to commence a refund action under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to collaterally attack a prior conviction alleged for purposes of sentencing enhancement on the grounds that his counsel had failed to adequately advise him of his constitutional rights, and therefore the guilty plea he entered was obtained in violation of his constitutional rights. The trial court denied defendant's motion without affording him an evidentiary hearing, relying on a United State's Supreme Court opinion which rejected a defendant's collateral attack of a state court prior conviction where the defendant had been represented by counsel. The trial court issued defendant an enhanced sentence and defendant appealed. The court reversed, holding that a state supreme court case which declined to rule that collateral attacks were only permitted in cases where a denial of counsel was alleged had not been overruled or undermined by later federal supreme court decisions. The court concluded that the accepted principles of stare decisis commanded the trial courts and courts of appeal to follow the state supreme court holding. Thus, defendant's representation by counsel did not preclude him from collaterally attacking a prior conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that there was nothing on the face of the Act to show that the fees collected were used to regulate respondent and that the Act did not require respondent to comply with any other conditions. The court ruled that where a payment was exacted solely for revenue purposes and the payment gave the right to carry on the business without any further conditions, it was a tax. The court also noted that even if the Act imposed a tax, that tax would be invalid because the legislature did not pass the Act by a two-thirds majority.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of three counts of possessing marijuana for sale on three different dates. He was also convicted of selling marijuana. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. Consecutive sentences were proper because the acts were sufficiently different from each other in intent and objective. Appellant's crimes did not occur on the same day but were spaced out over a period of 34 days. In addition, appellant was not in possession of the same bags of marijuana on different days. Moreover, one possession was part and parcel of an aborted sale, while another possession involved no sale component. The trial court properly doubled the subordinate terms because Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(c)(6) provides for sentencing a defendant consecutively on each count pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(e), which provides for doubling, so the determinate term for each count should be doubled. Finally, by the plain language of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(f)(2), a prosecutor may only move to dismiss or strike a prior felony conviction &quot;allegation.&quot; Once the prior felony conviction was proven, the prosecutor lost this power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Fresno County (California), in which he was convicted of second-degree murder involving the use of a deadly weapon and sentenced to 37 years' imprisonment. Appellant challenged the legislative version of the Three Strikes Laws as the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment and the imposition of sentencing enhancements under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 667(a), 667.5(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court rejected appellant's contention that the legislative version of the Three Strikes Law resulted in the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment upon appellant as a &quot;second striker,&quot; in violation of the guarantees under U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The court noted that although Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190 established the minimum term of imprisonment, the statute did not mandate that a murderer had to be sentenced under its provision to the exclusion of any other sentencing scheme. The court further found that appellant had failed to show that the disparity of punishments in California and other jurisdictions, noting that California's Three Strikes scheme was consistent with the nationwide pattern of substantially increasing sentences for habitual offenders. Although the court did direct the modification of the judgment to strike the reservation of jurisdiction to award victim restitution, the court affirmed as modified. The court concluded that the imposition of both a Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(a) and a Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667.5(b) sentencing enhancement were appropriate because the enhancements were based on different offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was modified to strike the reservation of jurisdiction to award victim restitution, but affirmed in all other respects. The legislative version of the Three Strikes Law did not result in cruel and unusual punishment where appellant failed to show a sentencing disparity among the jurisdictions, and the imposition of sentencing enhancements under two penal statutes was proper where the enhancements were for separate prior offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of inflicting corporal punishment on a cohabitant or spouse in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 273.5. The court of appeal affirmed. Defendant's simultaneous cohabitation with two or more people at different locations was not dispositive because he maintained a substantial ongoing relationship with the victim and lived with her for significant periods. There was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that defendant was cohabiting with the victim at the time of the subject incidents, whether or not he was simultaneously cohabiting with one or more other women. Although the trial court erred in leaving to the jury the essentially legal question of whether there could in fact be simultaneous cohabitation, there was no possible prejudice in this case. The trial court provided a proper definition of cohabitation. The jury's conclusion that simultaneous cohabitation could exist could have stood on the correct legal conclusion that a person could simultaneously cohabit with two or more individuals at different locations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorney had been awarded statutory and extraordinary attorney fees for estate representation. Petitioner filed a Cal. Prob.

Respondent beneficiary objected, and claimed that petitioner was previously overpaid for statutory fees because the rate was since lowered, and requested that he repay a portion of the statutory attorney fees he had been awarded. The court affirmed the denial of the fee request and the repayment request. The court found that petitioner's prior fee awards, which were not appealed, were vested, legally enforceable rights that could not be modified. The court held that the probate court had no power to order repayment of sums awarded to petitioner because allowances of statutory attorney fees were not subject to downward modification once the time to appeal expired. The court also held that the probate court had discretion to deny extraordinary fees where statutory fees reasonably compensated for statutory and uncompensated extraordinary services.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced under the three strikes law, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(b)(i), on the basis of prior juvenile convictions. Defendant challenged his sentence. The court held that the three strikes law included an express reference to a finding of fitness that the Legislature intended to be made before a juvenile offense could be treated a strike within the meaning of the three strikes law. In order for a juvenile offense to be included as a strike, the court had to make a finding on the basis of five criteria enumerated in Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 707, and determine the minor's amenability and fitness to being dealt with under juvenile court law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged a judgment prohibiting it from imposing conditions to abate nuisance activities at respondent liquor store owners' business, and the granting of relief from a stay of judgment pending review. The issue was whether the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, Cal.

The court held that the statute did not exempt a licensee, who allowed his business to be maintained as a nuisance, from appellant's administrative procedures to abate what had been found, after proper notice and hearing, to constitute a nuisance. Further, respondents were not immune from appellant's administrative procedures to abate nuisance activity at their liquor store despite their status as a licensed but nonconforming use. The judgment was therefore reversed, and the order granting relief from the stay of the trial court's judgment was vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the order granting relief from stay of judgment was vacated. Appellant city could impose conditions to abate nuisance activities at respondent liquor store owners' place of business, because the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 23790, did not prevent appellant from imposing conditions on continued operation of the liquor store.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that extension of his involuntary mental health treatment under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 2960 et seq., the amended Mentally Disordered Offender (MDO) statutes, violated the ex post facto clauses of the federal and state constitutions. The court agreed with appellant's contention and reversed the judgment of involuntary commitment. The court held that the MDO statutes could not be constitutionally applied to appellant because appellant committed his crime after the original statutes were found unconstitutional, but before the amendments to the statutes were effective. The court found that because the MDO statutes were penal in nature, application of the amended statutes retroactively violated constitutional ex post facto clauses. The court ruled that the existence of the statutory scheme did not constitute fair warning to appellant of the consequences of his criminal conduct because the statutes had been declared unconstitutional at the time appellant committed his crimes and were therefore unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected appellant's contention, finding that appellant's due process rights were not violated because the statute granted the same procedural rights at the de novo hearing to both appellant and the prosecution. The court noted that the procedure permitting the prosecution the right to a de novo hearing did not give the prosecution any greater advantage than that which was granted appellant because appellant was not required to give the prosecution notice of the motion to suppress at the preliminary hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted appellant of second-degree commercial burglary and petty theft with a prior conviction. The court affirmed those convictions after modifying them to stay the petty theft conviction. The court held that adjudicating appellant's prior robbery and kidnapping convictions in a single proceeding did not make those offenses one qualifying prior conviction under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667, reasoning that &sect; 667 did not require basing otherwise qualifying prior convictions on charges that were brought and tried separately. The court also found that the concurrent sentence that appellant received for his petty theft conviction had to be stayed, because absent &sect; 667, &sect; 654 would have barred multiple punishment on his current convictions. The court additionally concluded that &sect; 667's mandate to the executive branch to allege all prior convictions did not violate the constitutional separation of powers doctrine because the legislature could reasonably restrict a coordinate branch's constitutional functions provided that the exercise of those functions was not defeated or materially impaired.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's convictions for second-degree commercial burglary and petty theft with a prior conviction after ordering his petty theft sentence stayed because the applicable law barred multiple punishments for his current convictions. The court found that jointly trying appellant's prior convictions did not merge them under the three strikes law, which did not require separate trials of qualifying prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of one count of burglary and two counts of receiving stolen property. Appellant filed a motion to dismiss a prior &quot;strike&quot; under the three strikes law. The court denied the motion and appellant sought review. Appellant contended that the court should have granted his motion because the three strikes law had not eliminated the court's discretionary power under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1385(a) to dismiss the priors on its own motion. The state argued that the three strikes law prohibited the trial court from dismissing a prior &quot;strike&quot; conviction on its own motion, and that the court could only dismiss on the prosecutor's motion in the interests of justice, or for insufficiency of the evidence. The court affirmed denial of appellant's motion. Upon review of the statutory language found in the three strikes law, the court concluded that the trial court properly held that it did not have discretion to dismiss any of the prior &quot;strike&quot; convictions. The legislative enactment of the three strikes law was intended to eliminate the court's discretion to dismiss a strike. Appellant was properly sentenced to a third strike term.</SPAN></P>

The appellant and the victim's family were staying at a cabin for a family gathering when the incident occurred. The incident was the third such offense that appellant had been convicted of. Appellant was sentenced to two concurrent terms of 25 years to life. Appellant later sought parole, and challenged a California statute limiting in-prison credits to one-fifth of the total term as vague, arbitrary and discriminatory. Appellee challenged appellant's standing to raise an objection to the statute on hypothetical grounds, and argued that the credits limitation did not apply to a third strike defendant sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed as to interpretation of the California statute. The court noted that the credit limitation did not apply to appellant because he received an indeterminate sentence of 25 years to life.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This appeal involved a challenge to Cal. Stat. 433 (1993) extending the authority of appellant Department of Transportation to contract with private entities for the performance on state highway projects of design, inspection, and related work which had traditionally been performed by civil service employees. The superior court issued a permanent injunction against appellant prohibiting it in specified circumstances from contracting with private entities to perform state work. The superior court concluded that the statute was unconstitutional as in violation of the civil service article of Cal. Const., art. VII, &sect; 1. The court reversed the judgment holding that the statute was not violative of the constitutional civil service mandate. Article VII did not prohibit all government contracting with the private sector, only that which implicated the policies immanent in the constitutional provision. Those policies were twofold: to encourage efficiency and economy in state government and to eliminate the spoils system of political patronage by ensuring that demonstrated fitness -- rather than political considerations -- spurred all appointments to public service.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the sentence imposed by the Superior Court of Kern County, California, for his conviction for theft with a prior conviction for robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded guilty to theft with a prior conviction for robbery.  Cal. Penal Code &sect; 666. The aggravated term of three years for theft was doubled pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(e)(1). The prior prison term enhancement pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(b) was stayed pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 654. On appeal, the court noted that appellant was not subject to multiple enhancements, because neither &sect; 667(e) nor &sect; 666 were enhancements. Applying the &quot;three strikes&quot; sentencing provisions to the &sect; 666 term of imprisonment was consistent with legislative goals, and it was provided for by statute. The prohibition against double punishment for a single act or omission did not apply because the prior conviction was not an act or omission; it simply established appellant's status as a repeat offender. Double jeopardy was not an issue because appellant was not being punished for the earlier robbery. No factual or legal basis existed for the court to strike or stay the enhancement, thus the trial court's order was an unauthorized sentence. The trial court was directed to vacate the order staying imposition of the &sect; 667.5(b) enhancement, and to prepare a new abstract of judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of being an ex-felon in possession of a handgun, which he pointed at supermarket employees who detained him for shoplifting a can of frosting. Appellant was sentenced to 25 years to life under the three-strikes legislation,&nbsp;Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(b)(i). On appeal, he challenged the constitutionality and application of the three-strikes legislation. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the legislation did not provide for cruel and unusual punishment and did not deprive him of equal protection. A 25-year sentence for a recidivist offender like appellant, convicted of a nonviolent, non-serious felony but with at least two prior convictions for violent or serious felonies was not grossly disproportionate to the crime. Appellant's intractable recidivism, coupled with his offense, justified the term. Appellant failed to meet the threshold prerequisite to an equal protection claim of unequal treatment to similarly-situated persons.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the preliminary injunction, but refused to enter a protective order sealing record. Appellants sought review of the entry of the injunction and cross-appellant sought review of the denial of her motion to seal the record. The court reversed the order granting the injunction and held that it was an invalid prior restraint of free speech and that cross-appellant's right to privacy did not outweigh appellants' rights to publish opinions about her.

Penal Code &sect; 245(c), defendant's counsel indicated that he doubted defendant's competence. Based on the report of a court-appointed psychiatrist, respondent trial court found defendant incompetent, and committed him to the Department of Mental Health for placement in a state hospital. Later, respondent found that defendant's competence had been restored, and criminal proceedings were resumed. Defendant moved, under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 995, for a second preliminary hearing. Respondent denied the motion for lack of proof that defendant was incompetent at the time of the first hearing. The court of appeal granted defendant's petition for a writ of prohibition prohibiting respondent from conducting any proceedings other than granting defendant's motion under &sect; 995. Under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1368.1(a), the information had to be set aside because the defendant was found mentally incompetent shortly after the preliminary hearing, and due process required that he be given a second preliminary hearing when his competence was restored.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner filed for a writ of mandate. The court granted the writ and determined that there had been a regulatory taking of petitioner's property.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a medical clinic, challenged the orders of the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board (board) that ordered it to comply with discovery requests made by respondents. Petitioner argued that Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 4628, subd. (d), as applied was an unconstitutional fee regulation statute that deprived it of the ability to make any profit, and that the discovery requests constituted an impermissible invasion of the right to privacy in financial information. The court annulled the orders below. It held that the purpose of Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 4628 must govern the interpretation of subdivision (d). It found that subdivision (d) merely furthered the anti-ghostwriting purpose by listing permissible charges that were reimbursable as fees and costs for the preparation of the report. Thus, the statute was not unconstitutional. The court further held that respondents, when asserting a violation of the statute as an objection to payment of a bill, had a legitimate interest in identifying impermissible charges in the billings, but did not have a right to unfettered access to petitioner's business records. Respondents could only seek discovery of relevant and unprivileged information.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Contra Costa Superior Court (California), which sentenced him to 25 years to life as a &quot;third strike&quot; defendant under California's three strikes law, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(b)-(i), for first degree burglary, under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 459.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a career criminal, was convicted of first degree burglary, under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 459, for stealing a videocassette recorder and screwdrivers from an unoccupied residence. Because defendant had two prior serious felony convictions, he was sentenced under the three strikes law, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667 to 25 years to life. Defendant challenged his sentence as constituting cruel and unusual punishment. Although it did not file an appeal, the state argued that the trial court erred by failing to impose two five-year enhancements for defendant's two prior serious felony convictions and a one-year enhancement for a prior prison term under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667.5(b). The court found that because the enhancements were mandatory, the trial court erred in not imposing them and that the state was allowed to challenge the unauthorized sentence. The court also found that the sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment because the crime being analyzed for proportionality to the sentence was not burglary alone, but burglary by a recidivist. The court remanded for resentencing, stating that the trial court could dismiss a strike allegation if it was so inclined.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the portion of the trial court's judgment that sentenced defendant to 25-years-to-life, finding that it did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, but that the trial court erred in failing to impose mandatory sentence enhancements. The court remanded to the trial court for resentencing in order to afford the trial court an opportunity to dismiss a strike allegation if so inclined.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 13202.5, appellant juvenile challenged an order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which suspended appellant's license for nearly four years after she admitted violating Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23152(a) by driving under the influence of a drug.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant admitted to driving under the influence of a drug in violation of Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23152. At the disposition hearing, the trial court ordered appellant, then 17 years old, to be released on probation with a number of conditions, including that she was not to drive until the age of 21. No objection was made at the time, but defense counsel later filed a motion for modification, arguing that the order violated Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 13202.5, a law which requires that a court suspend a juvenile's license for one year after a violation such as appellant's. The juvenile court denied appellant's motion. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that appellant had not waived her appeal, but that it was within the broad discretion of the juvenile court to impose a term of suspension longer than that required by the law. The court found that the suspension was directly related to appellant's violation of driving under the influence of a drug, that the offense occurred only four days after appellant's probation for an earlier drug offense ended, and that the juvenile court had legal jurisdiction over appellant until she turned 21, the time the suspension was to end.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the juvenile court had the discretion to extend the driver's license suspension period provided for by statute because the suspension was directly related to appellant's offense of driving under the influence of a drug and because the juvenile court had jurisdiction over appellant until she turned 21 years old.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court struck the enhancement based on the victim's age, awarded presentence credit and affirmed. It held that the jury instruction given, based on dicta from a supreme court case, satisfied federal due process concerns, that the three strike law, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(b)-(1), did not impermissibly change the duties of judges and prosecutors, that any error in the exercise of judicial discretion was harmless, and that the three strike law was not unconstitutionally vague as applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Superior Court of Mono County (California), which convicted defendant on three counts of driving or taking a vehicle with the intent to permanently or temporarily deprive the owner of title to or possession of the vehicle and four counts of vehicle burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contested the use of the Cal. Penal Code &sect; 666.5, a recidivist enhancement statute, in his sentencing because the state did not prove he had been convicted previously of vehicle theft or that his current convictions were for vehicle theft. The court found that &sect; 666.5 applied only to motor vehicle theft under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 10851 because the Omnibus Motor Vehicle Theft Act of 1989, which created &sect; 666.5, made several references to &sect; 10851 but only referred specifically to motor vehicle theft under &sect; 10851 in &sect; 666.5. However, the court found that when defendant admitted to a 1975 conviction under &sect; 10851 he admitted to every element of the offense charged even if he did not specifically admit to vehicle theft under &sect; 10851. Furthermore, the court found that although the trial court erred in applying &sect; 666.5 because the jury only found defendant guilty of a violation of &sect; 10851in his current convictions rather than specifically vehicle theft, the error was harmless. The court affirmed the sentence and conviction of defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the defendant's conviction and the trial court's application of the vehicle theft recidivism enhancement statute because defendant admitted to a previous conviction for vehicle theft and the error in applying the statute absent a specific finding of vehicle theft was harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner church filed a petition to set aside the judgment that respondent church member had been awarded against it in a prior suit. Petitioner alleged that the judge in the former suit was biased against it. The lower court granted respondent's motion to strike the complaint and dismissed the suit pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 425.16. The court affirmed the order of the lower court, holding that petitioner's suit was a strategic lawsuit against public participation under &sect; 425.16, in that the suit sought to harass respondent for his having asserted his rights against petitioner in the prior suit. The court further held that petitioner had failed to meet its burden of proving that it could have prevailed in the suit against respondent because there was no admissible evidence alleged in petitioner's complaint to substantiate its claims of judicial bias in the prior suit. The court also affirmed the lower court's award of attorney fees to respondent and awarded respondent attorney fees on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's step-daughter was molested, and appellant was convicted of 20 counts of forcible lewd and lascivious acts under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288(b). Appellant sought review, and the court affirmed. The court found appellant had not needed to testify in order to preserve a challenge to the use of a voluntary extrajudicial statement for impeachment, the statement having been obtained in the absence of a knowing and voluntary waiver of the right to counsel guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. VI. However, the court overruled the challenge and found the voluntary statement had been admissible for impeachment because the exclusion of the statement from the prosecution's case-in-chief had sufficiently vindicated appellant's amend. VI rights. The court also found that limiting appellant's preemptory challenges to 10 had not deprived appellant of equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The court held appellant had not been entitled to 20 preemptory challenges under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 231(a) because &sect; 231(a), which applied to offenses with life sentences, had not been applicable to appellant's aggregate sentence for the multiple counts.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner brought the action pursuant to the federal Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Respondent trial court struck a paragraph from the complaint dealing with hedonic damages and petitioner filed a petition for a writ of mandate to compel respondent to set aside its order. The court issued an alternative writ of mandate, temporarily stayed further trial proceedings, and after full briefing and oral arguments, the court concluded the trial court's order striking the hedonic damages was correct. Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 377.34 allowed the representative of decedent to sue on decedent's cause of action before death and for punitive damages. The court opined these damage provisions sufficed to fulfill the compensatory and deterrent purposes of the federal Civil Rights Act in a case where the civil violation caused the death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county adopted flexible benefit plans for its employees. An independent public agency, whose dismissal from the action was not appealed by plaintiff taxpayer groups, adopted a policy of including defendant's benefit plan contributions in &quot;compensation&quot; to calculate retirement benefit payments of defendant's employees. Plaintiffs sued, claiming that defendant altered its employees' retirement benefit plan without a public hearing and an actuarial report in violation of Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 7507. Plaintiffs also claimed that inclusion of flexible benefits in retirement benefit calculations violated Los Angeles County, Cal., Code &sect; 5.27.100 because defendant's chief administrative officer (CAO) did not obtain approval of that decision from defendant's board of supervisors. The court affirmed a dismissal of the complaint. The record demonstrated that the decision to include flexible benefits was not made by defendant, but was made by an independent public agency that was not subject to Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 7507. Los Angeles County, Cal., Code &sect; 5.27.100 did not grant the CAO authority to set policy regarding inclusion of flexible benefit payments in calculating retirement benefits.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged his sentence asserting that it violated due process as well as the equal protection clause. The appeals court affirmed defendant's sentence under the Three Strikes Law. According to the court, a sentencing law that was utterly irrational was unconstitutional, and did not afford a basis for punishment. The court held that in the case of a substantive due process claim, deprivation of a right was supportable only if the conduct from which the deprivation flowed was prescribed by reasonable legislation that was reasonably applied. The court concluded that the Three Strikes Law bore a rational relation to the legislature's goal. The court stated that there was no doubt that the legislative purpose to punish recidivist criminals more severely than others was a proper goal. Next, the court stated that the equal protection clause was not violated because defendant was treated similarly to others similarly situated with respect to the legitimate purpose of the law. The court held that the legislature could enact laws signaling out certain recidivist for greater punishment.</SPAN></P>

Appellants sought review from an order, which invalidated a voluntary relinquishment of parental rights by respondent and ordered the twins removed from appellant adoptive family and returned to the extended family of the respondent biological parent.

The summary judgment was on the grounds that the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1790 et seq., violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art.

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of respondent on the grounds that the Act was applicable to respondent's sales and that it violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art.

Without ruling on the constitutional challenge to the Act, the court held that the Act's requirement of local repair facilities was not applicable to respondent because its sales were made over the phone from out of state and the nature of its contracts did not specifically require delivery in the state.

The court of appeals affirmed. Contrary to appellant's assertion, admission of the results of a preliminary alcohol screening (PAS) test administered to appellant at the scene of his arrest was proper to show appellant's intoxication. Evidence demonstrated that appellant voluntarily took the PAS test and then refused to take a chemical test under the implied consent law, Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23157(a)(1). PAS tests had been deemed scientifically reliable. Additionally, the legislative intent behind the enactment of the statute was to assist the prosecution of driving under the influence cases and not to exclude the admissibility of PAS evidence. Such evidence was relevant, not only to establish cause to arrest, but as tending to prove the essential element of the offense itself--the accused's intoxication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff life insurance companies and defendant California State Board of Equalization appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) which upheld the constitutionality of Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 12202.1, approved the insurance premiums tax rate for 1989, but held that the tax rate for 1990 was invalid. The trial court ordered defendant to refund plaintiffs for overpayment in 1990 and to pay their attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff life insurance companies brought suit challenging the validity of Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 12202.1 which authorized defendant California State Board of Equalization to impose new insurance premium tax rates for 1989 and 1990. The trial court held that &sect; 12202.1 did not violate the state constitution. The trial court also determined the revised tax rate imposed on plaintiffs for 1989 was properly calculated but the rate imposed for 1990 did not comply with &sect; 12202.1. The trial court ordered defendant to refund plaintiffs' overpayment for 1990. Defendant was also ordered to pay plaintiffs' attorney fees. Both parties appealed. The court agreed that &sect; 12202.1 was a valid delegation of power, and affirmed the validity of the 1989 rate and the invalidity of the 1990 rate. However, the court reversed insofar as the trial court's judgment required a refund to plaintiffs rather than a remand to defendant for recalculation of the 1990 premiums tax rate. Because plaintiffs brought the suit for their own strong personal economic interests, the court held, the award of attorney fees under the private attorney general statute,&nbsp;Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1021.5, was not justified.</SPAN></P>

The trial court permitted a public defender's office and an alternate defender office to represent both appellants at trial. Appellants were subsequently convicted of the charged crime. One appellant contended that because both offices were under the supervision of one public defender, they were not separate entities for conflict of interest purposes. Appellant contended that he was denied the right to conflict-free and independent counsel. On appeal, the court found that the offices were separate. The court found that the alternate defender's office litigated its own cases, had its own clerical staff and investigators, and that the offices were physically separated. The offices maintained minimal contact with each other. The court concluded that the offices provided representation to indigent defendants that was free from inherent conflicts of interest. The court stated that there was simply no evidence that either attorney represented conflicting interests in his defense of the case. Judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court found that a writ of mandamus did not lie to control exercise of defendant's discretion, especially given the fact that it was engaged in rulemaking. Defendant's decision was subject only to arbitrary and capricious review, and if it had adopted the rates established by plaintiff it might have violated the prohibition against delegating administrative rulemaking authority to private parties. The agreement was not enforceable as a collective bargaining agreement because employers and contractors had not signed it. Moreover, the jurisdictional agreement involved matters with which defendant did not have to concern itself, and was of limited scope.

Plaintiff claimed that the program violated defendant's charter, Cal. Pub. Cont. Code &sect; 2000, and equal protection. The state supreme court found that the program was not inconsistent with the charter and remanded for consideration of the remaining claims.  Section 2000 was intended to occupy the entire field with respect to programs designed to encourage use of minority- and women-owned business enterprises, but the program did not violate the statute.  Section 2000(a)(1), which allowed contractors to achieve a set percentage of minority/women owned subcontractor participation, had been found to violate equal protection unless there was a showing of past discrimination in the industry. Therefore, the program could require good faith efforts only and was constitutional. Accordingly, the court affirmed the trial court judgment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found true the allegations that he committed the offenses for the benefit of a street gang under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 186.22. Defendant appealed the gang enhancement, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support the fact that his gang existed at the time an earlier incident occurred; thus, he argued, there was no pattern shown. The reviewing court affirmed, finding that it was irrelevant whether or not the earlier incident was gang activity because, under &sect; 186.22, a pattern of criminal gang activity was properly shown exclusively from the charged offenses. The court found that because another gang member was charged for a separate offense for the same incident, the requirements of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 186.22 (e) were met. The court found that such interpretation did not violate defendant's due process or freedom of association rights. Nor did the statute violate Cal.

Appellant had requested a declaration that California's minimum wage laws were unconstitutional as applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant advocacy organization, an Arkansas corporation, employed workers in California to recruit members for local community organizations affiliated with the parent organization in order to promote its social agenda, circulate petitions, and solicit financial contributions. Appellant paid workers in varying ways that may not have risen to the level of California's minimum wage as specified in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 8, &sect; 11000 (2). Appellant contended that the minimum wage laws, while facially constitutional, were unconstitutional as applied to it because they restricted its ability to engage in political advocacy. In affirming the trial judge, the court ruled that just as with a facial constitutional challenge, any incidental infringement on appellant's freedoms under U.S. Const. amend. I could be justified by compelling state interests, unrelated to the suppression of ideas, that could not be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment entered against appellant advocacy group and held that California's minimum wage laws were not unconstitutional as applied to an organization whose purpose was political advocacy. The compelling state interest in ensuring a minimum wage adequate to maintain a decent standard of living justified any incidental infringement on appellant's First Amendment freedoms.</SPAN></P>

Appellant had filed the underlying action against appellee seeking damages for appellee's breach of a representation agreement between the parties. The trial court ruled that the parties' agreement was void because appellant had performed the duties of a talent agent by procuring employment for appellee without first obtaining the necessary license. Appellant admitted that he had no such license, but contended that a license was unnecessary because his procurement activities were minimal and merely incidental to his other responsibilities. The court found that appellant was not exempt from the licensing requirement, which applied equally to both full-time and part-time talent agents. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in favor of appellee, ruling that the representation agreement between the parties was illegal and unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

As a result of these contacts, appellant's employment was terminated and respondent commission affirmed. Appellant sought review after the lower court denied his petition for writ of mandate to compel respondent to vacate its order. The court affirmed, finding that appellant was not entrapped because the department's investigation did no more than give him an opportunity to act improperly. Appellant violated department rules against associating with criminals and bringing discredit to the department through those associations. He repeatedly had contact with a known criminal whose inquiries were improper. The rules were not vague because they gave appellant sufficient warning of prohibited conduct. Appellant's associations did not trigger U.S. Const. amend. I scrutiny where there was no significant expressive component.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) that convicted him of attempted injury on a cohabitant, battery and assault under Cal Penal Code &sect;&sect; 664/273.5(a), 242 and 240, and sentenced him as a repeat offender under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When appellant shoved his pregnant, live-in girlfriend, a few friends physically separated them and struggled with appellant to keep him away from his girlfriend until the police arrived.

On appeal, the court held that &sect; 664/273.5(a) did not require a traumatic injury, that under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 273.5(c) less harm needed to be inflicted on a cohabitant than on others before an offense is committed, and that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1159 allowed the jury to find appellant guilty of the attempt to commit the offense. The court held that appellant's sentence under &sect; 668(b)-(i) was not based on his current offense, but on his status as a recidivist who was a manifest danger to society and who had to be segregated from society for an extended period of time. Thus, appellant's sentence was not cruel and unusual and did not violate Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 17, and the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions for attempted injury on a cohabitant, battery and assault, and the 29 year to life sentence. The court held that appellant's attempt to inflict even minor injuries on a cohabitant was a crime because of the greater legal protections given to cohabitants, and that appellant's sentence as a recidivist as well as for his current offenses was not cruel and unusual, but necessary to protect society.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of petty theft, a violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 666. The trial court found an alleged serious felony &quot;strike&quot; under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667 to be true. Appellant was sentenced to a four-year prison term. Appellant sought review. The court found that the three strikes legislation was not vague because it provided that if appellant had one prior felony conviction that had been pleaded and proved, the determinate term was twice the term otherwise provided as punishment.  Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(e)(1). Appellant's four-year sentence was affirmed because it was a two-year term for the petty theft conviction, which was doubled. The court found that appellant's right to equal protection was not violated because others similarly situated were treated like appellant. The provisions in Cal.

Defendant argued that because the 20 percent limitation on conduct credits in &sect; 667(b)-(i) did not apply to time spent in presentence custody, it was unconstitutional, and a violation of the guarantee of equal protection because it resulted in an irrationally disparate treatment of offenders depending on how much time they spent in presentence custody. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, holding that defendant's equal protection argument had no merit because different classes of detainees were not similarly situated for equal protection purposes, and were not entitled to the same conduct credit, or the same ratio of conduct credit, for time spent in custody or detention. Pretrial detainees were still presumptively innocent; for strike prison inmates, the rehabilitative element of incarceration was overshadowed by the punishment element, calling for a longer period of incarceration.</SPAN></P>

A jury found him guilty of attempted voluntary manslaughter and enhanced allegations of deadly weapon use and infliction of great bodily injury. In addition to imposing a term of years, the trial court ordered defendant to pay restitution to the State Board of Control and imposed an additional restitution fine, which it stayed. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and struck the additional restitution fine. The court held that the trial properly admitted for impeachment purposes evidence of defendant's prior conviction for possession of marijuana for sale pursuant to Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 352. Restitution to the State Board of Control was proper pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1202.4(f), the court held. Because the 1994 amendment to &sect;1202.4(f) merely directed to whom restitution payments would be made without changing the substantive provisions of the law, the court found that it was not punishment and could be applied retroactively to defendant. Finally, the court held, the trial court erred in imposing the additional restitution fine, which was in direct conflict with the language of former Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 13967(c).</SPAN></P>

The superior court held that the legislature had unlawfully delegated to a private body, the authority, the power to levy the tax, in violation of Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 11. On appeal, the court affirmed. Despite voter approval for the tax, it was the authority, not the people, who imposed the tax. The legislature's act was subject to ratification by the people, but this did not mean voters delegated the power to tax to the authority. The legislature also could not delegate to the voters the power to delegate to a private person or body the power to levy taxes. The authority was a private body. Most of its board members were from private organizations, and the legislature could not create an office, determine that the office would be filled by an officer not selected by the public, and then give that office the power to levy a tax. Finally, art. XI, &sect; 11 did not contain an exception for &quot;regional&quot; as opposed to &quot;local&quot; taxes.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statute was constitutional because it was narrowly tailored to eliminate the harmful matter on the lower two-thirds of the front page of the publication.

However, requiring prosecution approval for the lower court's striking or dismissal of a prior conviction for sentencing purposes violated separation of powers. Thus, the lower court vacated both the plea agreement and the lower court's striking of the prior conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated both the plea agreement in the case and the lower court's striking of the prior conviction, finding that the admission of the prior conviction removed the court's authority to strike but holding that the requirement of prosecutorial approval for the court's action violated separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of a decision by the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, which struck a qualifying &quot;prior&quot; and imposed a sentence of nine years imprisonment on respondent for possession of codeine, Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11350, instead of imposing a 25-years-to-life sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state charged respondent with possession of codeine, Cal. Health &amp; Saf. Code &sect; 11350, and alleged respondent to have suffered four prior felony convictions. In a bifurcated trial, a jury found respondent guilty and then found true the four priors, as alleged. At the sentence hearing, over the state's objection, the trial court &quot;struck&quot; one prior in the interest of justice and then &quot;converted&quot; it into a state prison prior. The trial court then imposed the upper three-year term for possession of codeine, doubled it, and added one year, consecutive, for each of the three &quot;state prison&quot; priors for a total sentence of nine years. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed the conviction and findings, but vacated the sentence. In doing so, the court held that a trial court has no authority, on its own motion, to dismiss a qualifying &quot;prior&quot; in the interest of justice. The court explained that the absence of such power is not a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. Lastly, the court held that, in respondent's case, a 25-years-to-life sentence would not constitute cruel or unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded the matter to the trial court for a new sentence hearing.</SPAN></P>

S. &sect; 1983, that a neighborhood compatibility ordinance was void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homeowners applied for a variance to construct four additions to their residence. The application was approved, but defendant city discovered a non-approved patio and deck that violated a city ordinance. Defendant's planning commission conditioned final approval of the addition on removal of the unapproved structure. Defendant's city counsel affirmed the decision. Plaintiff filed suit alleging three causes of action under the federal Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. S. &sect; 1983. In granting defendant's motion for summary judgment the trial court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague and plaintiffs' failure to file an action for administrative mandamus to challenge the city's determination barred plaintiffs' claims under the federal Civil Rights Act. On appeal, the court affirmed. In requiring the design to &quot;respect the existing privacy of surrounding properties&quot; the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague. Plaintiffs' exclusive remedy was judicial review of the city's decision by administrative mandamus under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1094.5. Plaintiffs' failure to pursue this remedy resulted in the administrative action becoming final.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner filed a motion to strike one of the priors, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. The lower court refused to entertain the motion. Petitioner filed a petition for writ of relief, which the court granted. The court held that a motion to strike an allegation under the three strikes law based on ineffective assistance of counsel was the proper procedural vehicle in the state court to test an allegedly unconstitutional prior conviction, although the same might not be true in federal court. The motion did not violate Proposition 8, Cal. Const. art.

The trial court applied the proper standard in determining the child's best interest under Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 3011 when it assessed each parenting plan. It was free to treat sibling unity equally with any other factor that might be important to the child's welfare and did not abuse its discretion in finding that the move was not in the child's best interest.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted appellant of first degree murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187 and second degree murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187. At a penalty trial, the jury recommended life without the possibility of parole. Appellant challenged the conviction, arguing that the trial court erred in refusing voluntary manslaughter instructions, that the first degree murder should be reduced to second degree murder, and that his life without possibility of parole sentence was unconstitutionally disproportionate. The court affirmed, holding that no substantial evidence of provocation or heat of passion existed and that the trial court properly refused to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter. The conviction for first degree murder would not be reduced because it satisfied the three premeditation factors of plan, motive, and a planned method of killing. Appellant planned by bringing a loaded gun, his motive was revenge, and there was evidence of a planned method of killing. There was nothing disproportionate in the sentence because the California legislature authorized the death sentence for murders such as appellant's intentional killing of two unarmed, bound victims.</SPAN></P>

Reversing the judgment of the trial court, the court agreed that the sentence imposed was void because it was an illegal sentence bargain.  Cal.

We modify his sentence to reflect the proper three strikes term under section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(A)(ii). (&sect; 1260.)

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his sentence for possession of cocaine base ordered by the Superior Court of San Diego County (California) under the three strikes law set forth in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(b)-(i) (1994). Defendant argued that one or both of his prior convictions should have been stricken because the 10-years-to-life sentence that was substituted for the 25-years-to-life term mandated by &sect; 667 still constituted a life sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being found guilty of possession of cocaine base, defendant was sentenced under the three strikes law set forth in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(b)-(i) (1994) as a result of two prior burglary convictions. The trial court found that the mandated 25-years-to-life term for defendant's third strike was cruel and unusual punishment and imposed a term of 9-years-to-life plus 1 year for a prison prior, for a total 10-years-to-life term. On appeal, defendant claimed that one or both of his prior convictions should have been stricken because the remedy for the constitutional violation that occurred still constituted a life sentence. The court disagreed and held that the statutorily mandated 25-year-to-life sentence did not violate the constitution and that imposition of a term less than that mandated by the clear language of the three strikes law was an unauthorized sentence. The court reasoned that the mandated sentence was not disproportionate to the crime charged because defendant was being punished as a recidivist felon whose probation report showed a continuous criminal history for at least nine years. The sentence was modified to reflect the proper three strikes term under &sect; 667.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence for cocaine possession was modified to reflect the proper three strikes term. The court concluded that the mandated 25-year-to-life term for defendant's third strike was not cruel and unusual punishment even though he was a youthful, nonviolent repeat offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A road, in the city of Malibu and earlier in the county of Los Angeles, was blocked by earth movement and closed by defendant county. Plaintiff homeowners wanted the road re-opened. However, there was a question as to who owned the portion lying within defendant city. Defendant city filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that it neither owned nor controlled the road because following its incorporation, it had specifically rejected the road in question in its street system. Defendant county filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that governmental ownership and control of the road were automatically transferred to defendant city on its incorporation. Plaintiff homeowners filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted defendant city's motion for summary judgment. The court reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment because according to the court's interpretation of Cal. Sts. &amp; High. Code &sect;&sect; 980 and 1806, defendant city owned the governmental interest in the road and as such, defendant county's right, title, and interest in the portion which lied within the boundaries of defendant city vested in defendant city upon its incorporation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant city which determined that defendant county owned the road, which plaintiff homeowners sought to re-open. The court held that defendant city owned the governmental interest in the road when defendant city incorporated. Thus, the road was part of defendant city's road system and it would be responsible for re-opening the road.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an audit, respondent Director of Department of Social Services of the Health and Welfare Agency denied appellant county reimbursement for operating funds for the county's center providing emergency care for children threatened with harm or abuse.

The trial court held that the regulation was valid and that appellant had not exhausted its administrative remedies. The reviewing court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the regulation was valid because the funds at issue originate with the state and federal governments and were intended to fund temporary emergency care only, not care of unlimited duration. The regulation did not conflict with Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 10101 or 1991 Cal.

The court found that the trial court was required to determine the amount of direct victim restitution.

The court held that the jury in the partial retrial could not be informed of the former jury's decision with regard to civil penalties under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1794(c), which required a finding of willful failure to comply, because the special verdict form used by the first jury did not indicate the reason it declined to award civil penalties and petitioner was seeking penalties in partial retrial under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1794(e), which did not require a finding of willfulness. The court held that the civil penalty provisions in Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1794(e) were not impermissibly vague as to the standards to be used by a jury considering whether to impose such sanctions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the director and the deputy director of a county planning and building department, sought review of a decision from the Superior Court of Yuba County (California), granting defendant grand jury members' motion for judgment on the pleadings in an action for defamation in grand jury reports.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the director and the deputy director of a county planning and building department, brought suit against defendant grand jury members, claiming that they were defamed in grand jury reports. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court that granted defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court found that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 930 did not deny defendants substantive or procedural due process, and that plaintiffs' cause of action was sufficient to survive defendants' motion. Pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect;914.1, a superior court judge was required to inform defendants that their comments in grand jury reports pertaining to unindicted individuals were not privileged. Having been so informed, there was no violation of substantive due process. There were no procedural due process violations because nothing in &sect; 930 specifically denied defendants the right to defend against allegations of defamation. Although defendants may not have disclosed evidence brought before the grand jury or the content of grand jury deliberations, there were other sources of evidence to prove the truth of defendants' comments and defend against allegations of malice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner tenant screening service filed a petition for a writ of mandate seeking reinstatement of a previously revoked blanket exemption from the time restrictions imposed by Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1161.2. The blanket exemption had been revoked as conflicting with Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1785.13(a). Section 1785.13(a) was later found unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The real party in interest, a municipal court, conferred upon petitioner tenant screening service, a blanket oral exemption from Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1161.2(a). Thereafter, petitioner had immediate access to all of the municipal court's unlawful detainer files. The municipal court later revoked the blanket exemption as having been in conflict with Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1785.13(a). Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of mandate asking the court to order respondent superior court to issue a writ directing the municipal court to reinstate the blanket exemption. The court denied the petition. The court rejected petitioner's contention that there had never been a challenge to the blanket exemption. The blanket exemption was unpublished, unwritten, and telephonically granted, and petitioner failed to explain how anyone could have known about it or challenged it. The court found that the unconstitutionality of &sect; 1785.13(a)(3) had nothing to do with petitioner's case where the only issue was whether petitioner had a vested and irrevocable right to an oral exemption granted in a non-adversarial context.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioner tenant screening service's petition for a writ of mandate. The blanket exemption that petitioner sought to have reinstated was an oral exemption granted in a non-adversarial context. The decision striking down a statute as unconstitutional, upon which the blanket exemption had been revoked, was irrelevant because it did not address the constitutionality of the statute upon which the exemption had been issued.</SPAN></P>

Respondent Department of Fish and Game and intervenors were granted a summary judgment in the trial court, and appellants sought review. The court affirmed summary judgment and finding no fundamental rights at issue, applied the rational basis test and found that the article's classification scheme bore a rational relationship to legitimate state purposes. The court also found a rational basis for the gillnetting ban as a legitimate state interest in regulating business. The court dismissed appellants' challenge under U.S. Const. art.

Const. art. XIIIA, &sect; 4. The trial court ruled in favor of plaintiff. On appeal, defendant argued that the municipal services tax was not a special tax. The court agreed, finding that the municipal services tax was not unconstitutional because defendant was a general purpose entity and because the ordinance at issue specifically stated that the tax proceeds were to be placed in defendant's general fund and used for general municipal purposes. The court ruled that special tax funds were those levied by a limited purpose agency, dedicated to a special purpose, or deposited in the fund of a special purpose agency. The court also ruled that the trial court did not err in denying plaintiff's motion for class certification because plaintiff's action was brought under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax Code &sect; 5097, which did not provide for class claims. Thus, the court reversed that part of the judgment that ordered defendant to refund the taxes plaintiff had paid and reversed an attorney fees award to plaintiff.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state disputed a decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which, in the interest of justice, dismissed three &quot;priors.&quot; The state argued that there was no such authority under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 667(d), 1385. Defendant's cross-appeal argued that the statutes violated the separation of powers, a felony was not a qualifying &quot;prior&quot; if it were not charged and brought separately, and his sentence was cruel and unusual.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of a plea bargain, the trial court dismissed three prior felony convictions for purposes of the &quot;three strikes&quot; law, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(b)-(i). Defendant pleaded guilty and the trial court sentenced him to 25 years to life. The state challenged the dismissal of the &quot;priors.&quot; The court held that the trial court had no authority, under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 667(d) and 1385, to dismiss a qualifying &quot;prior&quot; on its own motion in the interest of justice. Because the statutes called for both the prosecutor and the trial judge to exercise their discretion in the matter, there was no violation of the separation of powers doctrine. There was nothing in &sect; 667(d) that required that, for defendant's three prior convictions to be considered as qualifying prior felony convictions, they had to have been brought and tried separately. Defendant had not satisfied his burdens under a three-part test established by a case, so his sentence was not cruel and unusual. The court reversed because defendant's guilty plea was based upon the dismissal of the &quot;priors.&quot; The court vacated the sentence and directed the trial court to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea and prior allegation admission.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant contended that &sect; 288.5 required proof of a specific intent, namely that the acts were committed for sexual gratification. Defendant also claimed that &sect; 288.5 was unconstitutional because, although it required a finding of three specific acts of sexual abuse, it did not require that the jurors unanimously agree on the same three acts. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that a review of the legislative history of &sect; 288.5 made it clear that the legislature intended to proscribe sexual conduct that was done for the purpose of, for instance, punishment or abuse instead of sexual gratification. The court held that &sect; 288.5 was constitutional because it criminalized a continuous course of conduct, not a specific act. As long as there was unanimity as to the continuous course of conduct, the fact that jurors did not agree on which specific acts constituted the course of conduct did not render the section unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was convicted of possessing marijuana in a county jail, which represented his fourth felony conviction. His other three included one for burglary and two for receiving stolen property. Additionally, respondent had a criminal history of minor offenses. The trial court imposed a sentence of probation finding that the sentence urged by petitioner state, would shock the conscience and affect the fundamental notions of human dignity, thereby violating the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by U.S. Const. amend. VIII, and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; VI. Petitioner filed a writ of mandate to the trial court sentence, which the court granted. The court held that the Three Strikes law, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(c)(2) clearly provided that once convicted, felons--assuming their prior felonies met the definitions provided in subdivision (d)--were not upon a subsequent felony conviction, eligible for probation.  Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(f)(2) implicitly limited the trial court's power to dismiss prior convictions, in furtherance of justice to only those occasions when the prosecutor so moved. The court held the trial judge was thus without authority to impose probation.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff then filed a prayer for declaratory relief that was denied by the court below.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant government official appealed an order of the Sacramento County Superior Court (California), which compelled him to prepare the title and summary for an initiative submitted by plaintiff environmental groups even though the initiative did not comply with Cal. Elec. Code &sect; 9002.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff environmental groups submitted an initiative to defendant government official. Defendant refused to prepare the title and summary for the initiative because plaintiffs did not comply with Cal. Elec. Code &sect; 9002, which required them to submit an affidavit that no monetary contributions were made to aid in the qualification of the initiative as a quid pro quo for inclusion of appropriations for other projects. The trial court found the statute infringed plaintiffs' U.S. Const. amend. I rights, and compelled defendant to prepare the title and summary. Defendant appealed. The court held that the statute impacted political speech as contributions to support a ballot constituted political expression. As the statute had more than an incidental impact on political speech, which was protected under U.S. Const. amend. I, it was subject to strict scrutiny review. The court determined that the statute was not narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling, legitimate goal of preventing corruption in the electoral process. The statute was therefore unconstitutional, and the court affirmed the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order compelling defendant government official to prepare the title and summary for plaintiff environmental groups' initiative was affirmed despite plaintiffs' failure to comply with a statute requiring an affidavit regarding contributions because the statute was unconstitutional; the statute had more than an incidental impact on political speech, and was not narrowly tailored to achieve the goal of preventing corruption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters of respondent county enacted Measure A, which amended respondent county's local coastal program (LCP). Measure A permitted respondent county to submit future amendment proposals to the voters. Appellant nonprofit organizations and appellant coastal landowners filed a petition for mandamus to stop respondent county from enforcing Measure A. Appellants filed a second action against respondent California Coastal Commission. The trial court consolidated the two actions. The trial court entered a judgment that denied appellants' petition for mandamus and refused to grant declaratory relief that found Measure A unconstitutional. On appeal, the court thought that the majority of appellants' challenges on appeal were directed towards their concern that Measure A dealt with a matter of statewide concern and was inconsistent with the Coastal Act of 1976 (Coastal Act), Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect; 30000 et seq. The court concluded that the local right of initiative was not barred by the fact that the Coastal Act dealt with coastal land use on a statewide basis. Additionally, the court found that Measure A complied with the Coastal Act. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stole a calculator worth $ 36.97. He pleaded guilty to petty theft and admitted to two prior felonies.

Defendant was sentenced to seven years in lieu of to life as would be required under the three strikes law. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded to permit defendant to withdraw his plea. The court held that it was the intent of the legislature to restrict a court's power to strike prior convictions under the three strikes law. The court held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(f)(2), in granting a prosecutor the right to strike a prior conviction, did not violate the separation of powers doctrine where it did not take any pre-existing power away from the trial court. The court held that where the legislature stated the three strikes law applied in addition to enhancement provisions, the trial court was not barred from using the same prior conviction to elevate petty theft to a felony and for purposes of the three strikes law.</SPAN></P>

It held that the three strikes law, 1994 Cal. Stat. 12, &sect; 1-2, was valid urgency legislation because the primary duties of the trial judge and prosecutor were not changed since their discretion in sentencing or prosecuting defendants had never been absolute. The court held that defendant's sentence was not cruel and unusual punishment because it was not grossly disproportionate to his more serious crimes and his prior crimes were numerous and violent. The court also held that using the same prior conviction as both a strike and as enhancement was not double punishment because the prior conviction was not an act under Cal.

The court affirmed, concluding the trial court correctly determined that it had no authority to strike the prior felony convictions once true findings as to those allegations had been made. The court held that the issue concerned the interplay of two provisions of the Cal.

Defendant then pled guilty to the other two serious-violent felony conviction allegations against him. The state argued that the lower court erred in dismissing the serious-violent felony conviction allegation. The court held that where the lower court indicated that it would drop one felony prior of defendant's in exchange for a guilty plea, it engaged in prohibited plea bargaining under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(g), which provided that prior felony convictions could not be used in plea bargaining. Furthermore, the court held that in granting defendant's motion to dismiss the subject felony prior, the lower court acted outside the authority of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1385, which only permitted an action to be dismissed on motion by a prosecutor or court. The court also held that the lower court's order dismissing defendant's prior felony was defective because no reasons for the dismissal were stated as required by section 1385.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the State of California, sought review of a decision from the Superior Court of Monterey County (California), dismissing a criminal complaint for committing various lewd acts dating back to 1952 against minors under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 803(g) (1993) as having been filed after the expiration of the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the State of California, challenged the trial court's dismissal of its criminal complaint against defendant brought under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 803(g) (1993), which provided a limitations period of one year from the date a person of any age reported that he or she was a victim of a lewd act while under the age of 18. Defendant was charged with various sex acts against minors dating back to the year 1952. The trial court sustained defendant's demurrer. On appeal, the court held that the complaint violated the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the United States and California constitutions. The statute punished as crimes certain acts that defendant previously committed for which the then-applicable statute of limitations had expired. Therefore, the subsequent statutory amendment extending the limitations period was unconstitutional. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of defendant's criminal complaint for committing lewd acts against children as long ago as 1952 because the charging statute, which enlarged the statute of limitations to one year from the date that a victim of any age reported the crime, was an illegal ex post facto law under the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two different cases, appellant parents had their parental rights terminated, under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 366.26, by order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California). Appellants, in each case, requested that the court independently review the record after presenting no issues or arguments. They argued that such review was due process entitlement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two cases, appellant parents challenged the termination of their parental rights. In each appeal, counsel for the parents raised no issues and presented no arguments, but requested that the court independently review the record. In a challenge to a judgment in civil cases, it was incumbent upon appellant to have presented argument and authority on each point made. In such cases, appellants' failure to articulate a pertinent and intelligible legal argument might have been deemed an abandonment of the appeal that justified dismissal. A narrow and specific exception to the general rule applied in a direct first appeal as of right in a criminal case. Appellants contended that due process entitled them to a similar exception. However, as it was a noncriminal proceeding, the court evaluated the requirements of federal due process by weighing the private interest at stake, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards, and the government's interest. The court concluded that the balance weighed strongly against independent review. The court dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals were dismissed where counsel for appellant parents filed briefs that raised no issues, the court was not required to conduct its own independent review of the record. The balance of due process factors weighed strongly against such review.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, concluding the lower court properly determined the statutory procedure for disposing of a non-meritorious cause of action that chilled the valid constitutional exercise of free speech applied to corporate publishers sued for libel based on an article made in connection with issues under consideration or review by executive, judicial, or legislative bodies. Respondents published a series of articles related to alternative lifestyle university respondents' failure to comply with county enforcement actions and a resulting civil rights lawsuit. The court explained the statute covered such activity which was an activity consistently characterized by courts as fee speech. The court next found the statute did not unconstitutionally interfere with access to the judicial system because its classifications were rationally based and the jury trial right was not violated.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that nothing in the trial court's remarks suggested that it wanted to impose a county jail sentence or that it believed it could not do so. The court found that the trial court did not have the power to dismiss defendant's felony charge on its own motion because the suggestion that judges had such power based on Cal.

Penal Code &sect; 459, computed by doubling the high term, under &sect; 667(e)(1), plus an additional year for the remaining prior allegation under &sect; 667.5.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a retail store with the intent to steal.

Penal Code &sect; 1385, the trial court sentenced defendant as if the current case was a &quot;second strike&quot; case. The prosecution appealed. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the striking of each prior was improper because &sect; 667(f)(2), which allowed the prosecution to strike a prior felony conviction allegation in the furtherance of justice, did not violate the separation of powers doctrine. Moreover, the &quot;fair import&quot; of the language of &sect; 1385(b) precluded the trial court from striking or dismissing prior felony conviction allegations pled under the three strikes law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate sought a declaration that a provision of the state Budget Act, which made those convicted of certain sex crimes ineligible for family visitation while in prison, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The California legislature added a rider to the state Budget Act. This provision required prisons to deny family visitation to inmates who had been convicted of committing certain sex crimes. Petitioner inmate was incarcerated in a state prison after having pleaded guilty to 11 sex offenses against children. Several counts were violations of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288, which was one of the code sections that resulted in disqualification for family visitation. Prior to the passage of the challenged budget provision, petitioner was eligible for family visitation. His visit was cancelled as a consequence of the budget provision. Petitioner asked the court to declare the provision unconstitutional on the ground that it violated the California Constitution's single subject rule. The court rejected respondent Director of the California Department of Corrections' contention that family visitation was merely a privilege, not a right conferred by any statute. The court concluded that the budget rider substantively changed the law and violated the single subject rule of Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect; 9. The court issued a peremptory writ of mandate against the provision's enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the provision of the state Budget Act that made those convicted of certain sex crimes ineligible for family visitation while in prison was unconstitutional because it violated the single subject rule. The court issued a peremptory writ of mandate that restrained respondent Director of the California Department of Corrections from enforcing the provision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Municipal Court of San Joaquin County (California), which convicted him of possession of cocaine and petty theft with a prior theft related conviction and enhanced his sentence under the &quot;three strikes&quot; law, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of cocaine and petty theft with a prior theft related conviction, and his sentence was enhanced under the &quot;three strikes&quot; law, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment but modified sentence to award defendant presentence conduct credit. The court found that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(c)(5) did not abolish presentence credit and the &quot;term&quot; to be doubled included subordinate terms. Section 667(c)(5) specifically stated that credit did not accrue until defendant was physically placed in the state prison. The court rejected the state's contention that the statute meant that defendant could not take advantage of credits until he was in prison. The statute did not explicitly reference presentence credit, and the court could not read that language into the statute. If the legislature intended to eliminate presentencing credits, it could have done so when the ambiguity of the statute was presented before the law passed. Under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(e)(1), the trial court properly doubled the base term for the drug offense and the subordinate theft term. &quot;Term&quot; was not limited to a single offense or the principal term.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction of defendant for possession of cocaine and petty theft with a prior theft related conviction and the sentence enhancement, but the court modified sentence to award defendant presentence conduct credit. The statute limiting credits did not include presentencing. The trial court could double the base terms of both offenses because the legislative scheme did not limit &quot;term&quot; to a single offense.</SPAN></P>

A stay of sentence for escape, assault with a deadly weapon, extortion, and false imprisonment of a hostage (counts I, II, IV, and VI) is imposed. The trial court is directed to send an amended abstract of judgment to the Department of Correction designating the following: count III as the principal offense with the upper term of four years, such term to be served consecutive to count V with a one-year enhancement for personal use of a dangerous weapon.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged their convictions in the Superior Court of San Luis Obispo County (California) for aggravated kidnapping, escape by means of force and violence, and lesser-related offenses, on sufficiency of the evidence grounds. Defendants also claimed that impermissible multiple punishments were imposed in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 654, and that the penalty for aggravated kidnapping was cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants captured a librarian at knifepoint and used her as a shield to effect their escape from a juvenile facility in a truck they extorted from a guard. Defendants were convicted of aggravated kidnapping, escape by means of force and violence, assault with a deadly weapon, false imprisonment, and extortion. They received a sentence of life without parole for aggravated kidnapping, and various determinate sentences were imposed to run consecutively to the life term. Defendants appealed on evidentiary and constitutional grounds. The court held that sufficient evidence existed to support the sentence of life without parole. The victim suffered &quot;bodily harm&quot; when defendants choked her unconscious and stabbed her, and was exposed to a &quot;substantial likelihood of death&quot; when she was used as a hostage and forced to join their escape. The life sentence was not cruel and unusual punishment, because of the substantial risk to human life posed by kidnappings, and the heinous nature of defendants' crime. With the exception of vacated lesser-included offenses, and two sentences stayed as impermissible multiple punishments under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 654, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' convictions were confirmed because sufficient evidence established that their victim suffered substantial &quot;bodily harm&quot; and was exposed to a &quot;substantial likelihood of death.&quot; The aggravated kidnapping penalty was not unconstitutional due to the heinous nature of the crime and defendants' individualized culpability, but a stay was required of the impermissible multiple punishments for escape and extortion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a complainant and associated individuals, challenged the trial court ruling, which concluded that dismissal of appellants' action for defamation triggered finalization of the arbitration award under Cal.

The court affirmed the grant of respondents' motion to dismiss and the trial court's order as to the arbitrator's award. The court did not see any point in forcing the parties to go through an unnecessary and unwanted trial, especially when a fundamental tenet of arbitration was avoidance of the court system. Thus, the court condoned an approach that safeguarded the rights of all parties to a trial following compulsory arbitration, while at the same time, to attempt minimal interference in the arbitration process.

Appellant citizens sought declaratory and injunctive relief against respondent city alleging the ordinance was preempted by and conflicted with the state statute, vague and overbroad, violative of equal protection, and discriminatorily enforced. On appeal, the court held there was no direct conflict between the statute and the ordinance because the statute defined minority and majority while the ordinance merely regulated the minimum age for persons on the premises of cabarets after hours; the ordinance was not vague or overbroad because a reasonable and practical construction of it limited its application to nightclubs after hours and there was no actual facts to show that it could not be applied constitutionally; and plaintiffs were not denied equal protection because the distinction in the ordinance between younger and older adults was rationally related to a legitimate state purpose of protecting younger adults and the community.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 6.45, found that respondent had submitted a false claim, and declared respondent an irresponsible contractor barring it from the city's public works projects for five years. The trial court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining appellant from enforcing the irresponsibility order and found no violations governed by &sect; 6.45. On appeal, the court reversed the injunctive order and found that appellant's code allowed declarations of contractor irresponsibility under &sect; 6.45 and San Francisco, Cal., City Charter &sect; 3.591, that respondent had a fair hearing, that respondent had submitted overage claims seeking more compensation, and that the PUC's determination did not conflict with the state's sole power to qualify and license contractors.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 667(e)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was serving time at an honor farm for burglary, a serious felony under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1192.7(c)(18). Less than one month after the three strikes law, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(b) through (i), was enacted, defendant escaped. He pled guilty to escape and admitted the prior felony conviction, which was included in an amended complaint. He was sentenced under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(e)(1) to twice the term, four years in prison. Defendant claimed that the use of the prior conviction in sentencing was improper because it would have been a retroactive application of the statute. The court found that the use of an increased penalty in subsequent offenses for habitual criminals was based on defendant being a repeat offender and was not a penalty for the prior offense. Defendant argued that the law was vague, but the court found that it was clear in &sect; 667(e)(1) that the enhanced penalty was twice the term provided for punishment. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that defendant's due process and equal protection arguments were without merit because the legislature had specifically intended to more severely punish repeat felons.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff out-of-state automaker appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), in favor of defendant city. Plaintiff maintained that certain business taxes imposed by the defendant on out-of-state manufacturers pursuant to provisions of defendant's municipal code were discriminatory and violated both the United States and California Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff out-of-state automaker made and sold products in defendant city. Plaintiff filed an action that sought a tax refund from defendant on the grounds that plaintiff was subjected to two taxes, a selling tax and a manufacturing tax, whereas a manufacturer that was based in defendant city and sold within the city's borders paid only a manufacturing tax. Plaintiff argued that the selling tax discriminated against out-of-city manufacturers and interfered with interstate and intrastate commerce in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, and the California Constitution. The trial court granted judgment for defendant. The appellate court reversed. The court noted that a state tax on interstate commerce was invalid unless it: [1] was applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing state, [2] was fairly apportioned, [3] did not discriminate against interstate commerce, and [4] was fairly related to the services provided by the state. The court ruled that the selling tax was discriminatory per se, and also failed the &quot;internal consistency&quot; test, which evaluates whether, if applied by every jurisdiction, a tax would avoid impermissible interference with free trade.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment for defendant city.

The victim delivered a stillborn baby and doctors testified that the causes of death were an abruption of the placenta and a blow to the baby's skull.

The court also found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting testimony regarding the victim's prior inconsistent statements pursuant to Cal. Evid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent former clients retained petitioner law firm to represent them in litigation against insurer and others. At the time respondents retained petitioner, petitioner also represented another client for whom insurer paid the costs of representation.

Respondents filed a crossclaim alleging malpractice and breach of fiduciary duties. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents based on petitioner's violation of Cal. Bar R., Prof. Conduct R. 3-310. Vacating the trial court's judgment, the court held that whether and when petitioner was obligated to obtain respondents' informed consent depended on whether and when petitioner was in a relationship with insurer that could have compromised petitioner's representation of respondent. That was a triable fact not properly disposed of by summary judgment.

On appeal, the court reversed, finding that on its face the statute relied upon by the state did not apply to appellant because he was neither detained nor arrested when he gave the false statement. The court gave deference to the statute as worded because of its clarity and lack of ambiguity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder, found incompetent to stand trial, and sent to a mental institution. He subsequently regained his mental capacity and pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter. Prior to his release from prison on parole, defendant was certified as a mentally disordered offender (MDO) pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 2962. He challenged his involuntary commitment required by the statute, contending that the MDO statute, as applied to him, was ex post facto. The trial court found that defendant was an MDO within the meaning of &sect; 2962. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that because defendant committed his crime more than a month after the effective date of the MDO statutory scheme, the MDO statutory scheme, as enacted and amended, did not violate the ex post facto clauses of the United States and California Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of two counts of forcible rape and one count of kidnapping with intent to rape. Defendant sought review of his convictions contending that the trial court should have instructed the jury that movement that substantially increased the risk of harm to the victim over and above that necessarily present in the crime of rape itself was an element of the kidnapping with intent to rape charge. The court modified defendant's sentences and affirmed the convictions in all other regards. The court explained that judicial precedent relied upon by defendant, which was decided while the appeal was pending, was applicable and that the trial court's instruction did not comply. The court, however, concluded that the harmless error standard applied to the failure to instruct on a single aspect of a multi-element offense. Accordingly, because the overwhelming and uncontradicted evidence indicated that the instructional error did not contribute to the verdict., the court found that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The lower court entered summary judgment to appellee under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 437c, ordering appellants to return certain documents to appellee. Appellants sought review from the judgment and order. The court found that appellants' at-will status under Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 2922 precluded any breach of implied contract. Further, where there was no implied contract there was no breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Nor was there any violation of public policy where lack of lawful qualification for appellants' jobs barred them from complaining that they improperly lost them. Also, the misrepresentation claim was meritless due to appellants' at-will status. Finally, the order that the documents be returned was proper where there was no abuse of discretion in finding attorney-client privilege.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of felony sale or transportation of cocaine base pursuant to Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11352A. Defendant then appealed, arguing that the failure to advise him pursuant to the Faretta test of the dangers of self-representation required reversal. The court found that defendant had voluntarily chosen self-representation at arraignment, waiving the counsel who had been prepared to accept appointment to represent him. Although there had in fact been no admonition concerning the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, the court held that the standard of review to be applied was the reversible error standard. Thus, where defendant had sought to abuse the Faretta right by later changing his mind about self-representation and misusing public funds given him for his self-representation the court found that no reversible error had occurred where the evidence demonstrated defendant's guilt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, holding that although defendant's waiver of counsel was not necessarily knowing, it was voluntary, such that where defendant attempted later to misuse that right and to change his mind about self-representation no reversible error was shown.</SPAN></P>

Reviewing the language of the ordinance and comparing it to similar curfew ordinances, the court held that the ordinance at issue was not unreasonably restrictive, as it prohibited &quot;loitering&quot; rather than mere &quot;presence&quot;. The court also found that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague, as it provided fair notice as to what conduct was prohibited.
