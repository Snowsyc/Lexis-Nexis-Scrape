The court reversed and rendered a declaratory judgment that appellant flood control district could rescind two permanent easement transactions and recover the purchase prices paid. The court concluded that the purchase of one permanent easement from appellee was voidable because the votes of two of appellant's directors violated the applicable conflict-of-interest statute and the agreement could not have been approved without their affirmative votes. The court concluded that appellant's acquisition of another easement from appellee violated the Texas Open Meetings Act, and rendered the transaction voidable by appellant. The attempt by appellant's board of directors to ratify the transaction was ineffective. The court held that the suit involved the exercise of a governmental function and concluded that appellant was not estopped to deny the enforceability of a settlement agreement approved by its board of directors. The court also concluded that public policy barred appellee from asserting equitable estoppel because he was a knowing beneficiary of the illegal transaction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction in the County Criminal Court No. 1, Dallas County (Texas) for driving while intoxicated (DWI). On original submission, the court sustained appellant's first point of error, reversed the trial court's judgment, and remanded for a new trial. Thereafter, the criminal appellate court ordered reconsideration of all points of error in light of changes in the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for driving while intoxicated (DWI). He urged that the placement of a roadblock at the target site where he was arrested violated his constitutional rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, and that the trial court erred when it overruled his motion to suppress evidence that was seized at the roadblock. The court found that while Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 6687(b), &sect; 13 allowed police to stop and detain a motorist for a driver's license check, it did not validate the stopping an automobile if it was not clear that the reason for the detention was to check licenses. The court determined from the evidence that the purpose of the roadblock was to catch drunk drivers and that appellant was not detained pursuant to a routine driver's license check authorized by the statute. The court held that because Texas did not have a legislatively developed administrative scheme for sobriety checkpoints, the DWI roadblock at issue was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained appellant's first and second points of error finding that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to suppress evidence seized at the roadblock where he was arrested, reversed the trial court's judgment, and remanded for a new trial holding that the roadblock was unconstitutional in that it violated U.S. Const. amend. IV and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insolvent savings and loan association and liquidator sought review of the judgment declaring that a federal suit filed by appellee IRA depositors tolled the limitations in the Savings and Loan Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 852a (Supp. 1991), in the suit brought by appellees in the District Court of Travis County, 53rd Judicial District (Texas) to obtain priority for their deposits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Seeking priority, appellee IRA depositors timely filed suit in federal court after appellant liquidator determined their accounts in appellant insolvent savings and loan association were not entitled to priority.

Appellants asked that a class suit be designated and counterclaimed for a decision, under the Declaratory Judgment Act, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 37.001-37.011 (1986 and Supp. 1991), that the suit was untimely. Reversing the trial court's decision that the federal suit tolled the three-month limitations period, the court noted that &sect; 8.09(f) of the Act established the procedures for appealing claim decisions. Finding &sect; 8.09(f) jurisdictional, and constitutional under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, the court held that appellees were required to file within three months in the state district court, and the federal suit did not toll the statute. The court noted that &sect; 8.09(f) applied to statutory rights to appeal appellant liquidator's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of their convictions for possession of cocaine with intent to deliver, which were entered after a jury trial in the 292nd Judicial District Court, Dallas County (Texas). Appellants claimed that the evidence was insufficient to link them to the cocaine seized in an apartment, and that the confidential informant should have been identified under Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 508.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of their convictions of possession of cocaine with intent to deliver after a jury trial. Appellants claimed that no evidence affirmatively linked them to the cocaine seized in an apartment pursuant to a search warrant obtained on information from a confidential informant. The police found cocaine and weapons in the apartment, but no documents and they did not check for fingerprints. Rejecting appellants' complaints of hearsay under Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 801(d), the court ruled that the unobjected-to officers' testimony that the manager said appellants lived in the apartment, together with one appellant's provision of that address when asked after their arrest, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.21 (1979), were sufficient to permit the jury to find both of them exercised control over the apartment. The court emphasized that the drugs were in plain view and were conveniently accessible to appellants, who controlled the apartment where the drugs were found. The court added that Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 508 did not require identification of the confidential informant because it was neither relevant nor helpful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellants' convictions for possession of cocaine with intent to deliver after a jury trial, explaining that there was sufficient evidence linking appellants to the cocaine in that it was in plain view, conveniently accessible to them, and they controlled the place where the cocaine was found.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile contested the determination from the County Court at Law, Brazos County, Texas, that he engaged in delinquent conduct by committing murder and aggravated robbery, and the sentence of nine years' confinement under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 54.04(d)(3) (Supp. 1991) for murder, and an indeterminate period for robbery, under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 54.04(d)(2) (Supp. 1991). Appellant contended the determinate sentence was erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court reversed appellant juvenile's nine year sentence for murder because the record did not contain anything indicating that prosecution of appellant was affirmatively approved by a grand jury, as required by Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 53.045 (Supp. 1991). Yet it affirmed the indeterminate sentence for aggravated robbery, and remanded the murder allegation for imposition of an indeterminate sentence. The court held that the amended petitions should have been presented to the grand jury, and that a prosecutor's oral representations of approval by a grand jury was not a certification. Without certification, the trial court was without jurisdiction to impose a determinate sentence. Thus, the court reformed the judgment, and remanded. Because appellant and his mother were properly served with the original petition, the trial court had acquired jurisdiction over him. Thus, the state's failure to serve appellant with the second amended petition did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction. Appellant had not preserved any other alleged errors for review. Thus, the trial court did not err in failing to include jury instructions. The remainder of the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that it had jurisdiction over appellant juvenile, and affirmed the determinations as to murder and aggravated robbery. The court affirmed the indeterminate murder sentence, but reversed and remanded for reformation as to the determinate sentence for the robbery, holding that there was no showing that the grand jury had pre-approved the imposition of a determinate sentence, which was statutorily required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for possession of less than 28 grams of cocaine from the 184th District Court, Harris County (Texas), contending that the trial court committed reversible error by not admonishing him that his plea of guilty would subject him to the possibility of deportation, and that his conviction under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.15 (1977) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for possession of cocaine after entering a guilty plea, on the grounds that reversible error occurred when the trial court failed to admonish him that his plea would subject him to deportation proceedings, and that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.15 (1977) was unconstitutional because he was denied the right to present evidence on his own behalf. On appeal, the court affirmed appellant's conviction because the record was ambiguous and failed to demonstrate that appellant was not a U.S. citizen. Absent that showing, the trial court's failure to address the citizenship issue was not reversible error. The court held that art. 1.15 neither prohibited appellant from offering, or the trial court from receiving and considering, evidence offered by appellant, nor did the article violate due process or equal protection. The court found that there was no requirement, in the state or federal constitutions, for a specific, express waiver of the right to compulsory process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reviewed a judgment regarding the decision of appellant Public Utility Commission to order appellee utility company to reduce its rates. The court affirmed the portion of the judgment reversing appellant commission's order and reversed the judgment to the extent it affirmed appellant commission's order. The court held that appellant commission did not abuse its discretion in employing the double leverage method in arriving at an opinion of appellee's cost of capital and in making a diminished-risk adjustment. However, the court held that appellant commission erroneously included payments to affiliates in calculating the necessary and reasonable operating expenses without making the required findings under Public Utility Regulatory Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1446c, &sect; 41(c)(1) (Supp. 1991). Additionally, the court held that appellant commission's findings regarding appellee's federal income tax liability did not conform to &sect; 41 (c)(2). Finally, the court held that appellant commission was precluded from making effective date at a date earlier than that of its final order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the decision of the 103rd District Court of Cameron County, Texas, which denied her application for writ of habeas corpus, which was premised on the theory that Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.126 (1991) was void for vagueness because it failed to define &quot;finance,&quot; &quot;invest,&quot; and &quot;funds.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.126 (1991), alleging that she intentionally and knowingly financed and invested funds to further the commission of the offense of aggravated possession of marihuana. Appellant filed an application for writ of habeas corpus, claiming that the indictment was based on a constitutionally invalid statute because it failed to define the terms &quot;finance,&quot; &quot;invest,&quot; and &quot;funds.&quot; The trial court denied relief. Appellant challenged the decision. The court affirmed, holding that by applying common dictionary definitions to the terms &quot;finance,&quot; &quot;invest,&quot; and &quot;funds,&quot; &sect; 481.126 clearly proscribed a person from supplying money which the person knew was intended to further the possession of marihuana. The court found that a person of common intelligence could determine with reasonable precision what conduct was prohibited by the statute and that the statute provided sufficient notice to law enforcement personnel to prevent arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bondsmen initiated suit for damages and injunctive relief stemming from appellee sheriff's collection of the pre-conviction bail bond approval fees. The bond amount was set by order of appellee commissioners court. Appellees argued that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action. The trial court found it had jurisdiction and judgment was entered in appellees' favor. On appeal, the court found that the lower court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. According to the court, subject matter jurisdiction could not be conferred by agreement and could not be waived. The court stated that Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 8 and Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 24.020 (1988) provided that the district court had appellate jurisdiction and general supervisory control over the commissioners court. However, the court held that because the present suit was a direct attack on the order, it was not an appeal subject to the present concurrent jurisdiction of the district and county courts. The court further held that article 25.0732(t) which attempted to confer jurisdiction on the lower court was unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

Appellant drove to his workplace nearby to get proof of insurance. The officer testified appellant asked to drive there; appellant testified the officer told him to drive there. The officer saw appellant driving erratically. Appellant failed field sobriety tests and was arrested. A jury convicted appellant of driving while intoxicated. On appeal, the court affirmed. Appellant could not claim the defense of entrapment because appellant's testimony indicated only that he was induced to drive, not to drive while intoxicated. In addition, he denied the offense, whereas entrapment assumes the offense was committed. The court also determined that that no warning was required before performing the field sobriety test, that a seven-month delay between arrest and trial was not a constitutional violation, that the state did not admit there was no scientific basis for the field sobriety tests, and that a trial court need not admonish a misdemeanor defendant about the range of punishment before a plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant motorist's conviction for driving while intoxicated.

Appellant had been initially charged with murder and was later charged with aggravated robbery of the decedent. The court stated that article 17.151 was applicable to the murder charge against appellant but that the 90-day period had not yet elapsed on the subsequent aggravated robbery charge.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient sought review of summary judgments rendered in favor of appellees, a doctor and hospital, by the 295th District Court, Harris County (Texas). The trial court held that appellant's medical malpractice suit was barred by the statute of limitations set forth in the Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act of Texas, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (Supp. 1991).</SPAN></P>

After appellant left the hospital, her condition deteriorated, and she became paralyzed. She was informed by other health care providers that her injuries had been caused by appellees.

Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (Supp. 1991), she argued that the limitations provision was unconstitutional as applied to the facts of her case. In affirming the trial judge, the court ruled that in order to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 10.01, appellant had to have alleged that the limitation statute cut off her cause of action before she knew or should have known that a cause of action existed. Appellant conceded that she knew of her cause of action four months prior to the expiration of the two-year period, and the court held that four months provided a reasonable opportunity to consult an attorney and file suit.</SPAN></P>

Appellees filed motions for summary judgment that addressed all claims asserted by appellant and properly incorporated appellant's deposition testimony. The motions for summary judgment were granted. Appellant challenged the entry of judgments. The court affirmed the judgments on the grounds that general allegations of mere harassment, without more, were insufficient to raise an issue of material as to whether working conditions were so intolerable that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign. In addition, the court held that the record was devoid of evidence that indicated that the treatment complained of by appellant was the result of any policy or custom official adopted by appellee school district in violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and did not refute appellee supervisor's defense to the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress.</SPAN></P>

Appellants contend there were 38 different points of error committed in the lower court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Beginning in the 1950's to the present, appellees worked as insulators or maintenance mechanics performing insulation repair work. During their employment they handled numerous products that contained asbestos manufactured by the appellants. Although the dangers associated with exposure to asbestos were well known by the late 1940's, appellees were never warned of these dangers. As a result of asbestos-related injuries or death from their exposure to the various products manufactured by the defendants brought a strict liability suit against them for failure to warn the risks of exposure to asbestos. A trial jury awarded compensatory damages and punitive damages in favor of the workers and against the manufacturers. The manufacturers appealed the damage awards setting out 38 different points of error. The court, upon review, affirmed all the judgments with the exception of an award of future medical for one appellee, whose case was severed and remanded for a new trial unless a voluntary remittitur was made, and the exception of setting aside of exemplary damages against one appellant.</SPAN></P>

The court held that appellee's jury charge was adequate because it was carefully tailored to the charge against appellant and met the requirement for proof of each element beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellee's jury argument was not improper because appellee was responding to an argument made by opposing counsel. The court held that appellee's failure to videotape appellant pursuant to 1983 Tex. Gen. Laws 1568, 1605 did not result in a denial of due process. Appellant waived his right to a blood test under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 67011-5, sec. 3(d) (Vernon Supp. 1990) because he refused to provide a breath test sample. Appellant's refusal to provide a breath test was admissible under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of appellee heirs and excluded appellants, adopted family members, from participating in decedent's testamentary trust, appellants challenged the judgment. In affirming, the court held that adopted family members were not entitled to participate in the distribution of a testamentary trust. In determining that appellants were not entitled to take under the trust, the court looked to the state's law at the time of decedent's death and the impact of that law on the language of the trust instrument. In emphasizing the instrument's bequest to &quot;lawful heirs&quot; &quot;born of the body&quot; of decedent's siblings, the court held that case law had construed &quot;born of the body&quot; to exclude adopted family members from benefiting under a trust. The court then found that although the law at the time of decedent's death allowed an adopted child to inherit from its adopted parents, the child could not adopt through them. Moreover, the court noted that the question of whether decedent's will, which included the testamentary trust, was ambiguous was a question of law and that both the law and the trust made it clear that adopted parties could not inherit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's summary judgment entered in favor of appellee heirs because the language of the testamentary trust and the law at the time of decedent's death precluded appellants, adopted family members, from participating in the distribution of decedent's testamentary trust.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter after the car he was driving while intoxicated and under the influence of a controlled substance was involved in an accident which resulted in death. Defendant was taken to the police station following the accident and, while en route, questioned a police officer about what charge he would be arrested under. Defendant made certain statements at this time. It was necessary for police to assist hospital personnel in forcibly drawing blood, as required under Tex. Rev. Stat. Ann. art. 67011-5, &sect; 3(i)(1991), when defendant failed to cooperate. Defendant appealed his conviction on multiple grounds and the court affirmed. The court held that the statements which defendant provided police while en route to the station and in custody, which did not implicate defendant, were properly admitted. Where defendant initiated the questioning, this was not a custodial interrogation under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.22, &sect; 5(1979).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizen challenged the decision of the 269th District Court, Harris County (Texas), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee city in an action filed by appellant to recover for injuries he sustained when he fell off a swing at a city park.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizen brought an action against appellee city for personal injuries, alleging that appellee negligently installed a swing in one of its parks. Appellant was injured when the swing he was on came unlatched from the chain. The trial court, relying on Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 75, which limited the landowner's liability, granted appellee's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that swinging was a recreational activity that was covered under &sect; 75. The court further held that a reasonable meaning of &quot;recreation&quot; would include the activity of swinging on a swing-set provided for public use. The court also overruled appellant's objection that &sect; 75 violated the equal protection clause of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, holding that &sect; 75 bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest. Finally, the court held that because appellant could not establish that he had a cognizable cause of action that was restricted by &sect; 75 he failed to show a violation of the open courts provision of the constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment in favor of appellee city and held that swinging on a swing set was recreational activity, and therefore appellee was not liable and the statute that limited appellee's landowner liability did not violate the equal protection clause of the Texas constitution or the United State's constitution or the open court provision of the constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city filed an action seeking a resolution in its labor dispute with appellee firefighters' union. The trial court found that Proposition No. 1, which required nonbinding mandatory arbitration in labor disputes, conflicted with Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

The appellate court affirmed the finding that Proposition No. 3 was valid finding that the act gave authority to resident voters to adopt or repeal its provisions and that by adopting Proposition No. 3, which amended the arbitration provision of the act, the voters had legally exercised their authority. The court rejected a prior holding that the act was unconstitutional because it attempted to delegate a legislative function to the judiciary without sufficient standards to guide the discretion conferred. Rather, the court held that there was no provision in the act that required it to find that the legislature impliedly limited the power of a city to propose an amendment concerning arbitration.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged his conviction, contending that the Texas Securities Act was unconstitutional for vagueness, that the trial court erred by hearing appellant's motions for new trial in the absence of counsel, and that the trial court erred in ordering restitution. Affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that the statute was not unconstitutional because it gave fair notice to a security seller that he must disclose the previous diversion of invested funds. The court further held that appellant's written communications with the court were insufficient to constitute a motion for new trial; therefore, the absence of counsel to represent appellant at the hearing did not constitute reversible error. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering restitution because the money invested pursuant to the fraudulent scheme exceeded the ordered restitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's convictions for the fraudulent sale of securities because the statute requiring full disclosure to potential investors was not unconstitutionally vague, there was no motion for a new trial before the court that would have required the presence of defense counsel, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in fixing the amount of restitution.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, the North Carolina Department of Social Services filed a petition in the Texas court on behalf of the mother and child seeking child support and medical coverage under the Revised Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act. The district court awarded child support and declined jurisdiction to determine access to the child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his convictions for aggravated sexual assault of a child, contending that his conviction and sentence unconstitutionally placed him twice in jeopardy for the same offense by charging the same offense committed by different methods. The court noted that the sentences ran concurrently. Logically such sentences did not twice jeopardize or put defendant in danger of either additional or increased punishment. Defendant committed two acts performed with his sexual organ, vaginal penetration and oral penetration. The evidence revealed that both acts occurred in a motel room on the same day. The record, however, was silent about when each act occurred in relation to the other. They reasonably could not have occurred simultaneously. One act must have been completed before the other began. Although there was some overlap of proof, such as same victim, date, and place, each conviction required the allegation and proof of an entirely separate element that the other did not. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee insurers represented appellant insured in a medical malpractice action against appellant's former patient. Appellant was held liable and a non-execution agreement was executed, which provided that the patient would only execute against appellant's insurance policy proceeds. Appellant contended that appellees failed to properly settle, defendant, and provide him with coverage in the action. The lower court awarded judgment in favor of appellant, pursuant to Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.21 &sect; 16(b)(1) (1990). The court held that, because there was no statutory right to contribution or indemnity from other parties for violations of art. 21.21, appellees were not entitled to credit for payments made by other parties. The court determined that the non-execution agreement was merely a covenant not a release, and therefore, such agreement did not affect appellees' liability. The court held that appellees' duty toward appellant extended beyond reasonable settlement attempts to investigation, preparation, and defense of the lawsuit. The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court with a damages modification.</SPAN></P>

The evidence was sufficient to support the jury's finding that appellant delivered more than 50 pounds of marihuana. Although appellant was denied counsel at his preliminary hearing, a subsequent grand jury indictment preempted the prior finding of probable cause. The trial court did not err in denying appellant's Batson motion. The jury charge was not defective. The statutes authorizing appellant's punishment were not unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the juvenile appellant had engaged in delinquent conduct by committing aggravated kidnapping and assessed a determinate sentence of 20 years. Appellant challenged the trial court's jurisdiction to order a determinate sentence because the grand jury did not approve the original petition and that he was not served with the petition. The court disagreed and affirmed the trial court's order. The court held that the state filed a petition that met all the requirements of Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 53.04 (1986), and properly sought the grand jury's approval of the petition. The court also held that the trial court read the petition into the record in appellant's presence and that appellant's counsel then stipulated that appellant had been served with the petition. Therefore the trial court had jurisdiction. The court rejected appellant's claim that the determinate sentencing statutes were unconstitutional because appellant made no objection at the hearing and thus failed to preserve the claim for review.</SPAN></P>

The aircraft in question was taxed in some manner by multiple appellee counties and their appraisal districts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted summary judgment to appellees counties and appraisal districts on their counterclaim for delinquent ad valorem taxes, penalties, interest and attorney's fees against appellant corporation on their aircraft. The trial court granted summary judgment to the appellees denying appellant's petition for relief from double taxation. Appellant failed to exhaust prerequisite administrative remedies to challenge the assessed taxes. Appellant, taxed by two appellee counties on the aircraft, challenged the trial court judgment on appeal. The court noted that appellant resorted to direct suit to obtain determination of situs to avoid double taxation because neither the statutes nor the administrative procedures outlined a process to determine the aircraft's situs. The court, however, found appellant's argument regarding lack of due process and violation of the state constitutional open courts doctrine in his contest of the tax assessments unsupported by law. The court affirmed the lower court judgment because appellant, as the taxpayer, had not exhausted the administrative procedures to contest assessment. Appellant was also assessed damages for filing a frivolous appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court judgment and damages assessed against appellant corporation in this case. The court found that appellant failed to exhaust procedures set forth in the statutes for taxpayers to resolve issues with taxing authorities. The court also assessed damages against appellant after finding their appeal was brought for the purpose of delay and without sufficient cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his wife were involved in an altercation, wherein defendant raised his leg to ward off a kick from his wife. A jury found defendant guilty of misdemeanor assault. On appeal, defendant argued that by not recognizing &quot;passive self-defense,&quot; Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 9.31 (1974) was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend V and U.S. Const. amend XIV. The court found that the statute enjoyed a presumption of constitutionality that defendant failed to refute. Defendant also argued that by raising his leg to ward off a kick was a form of &quot;passive self-defense,&quot; and required the trial court to give a jury instruction on self-defense. However, the court found that defendant's &quot;passive self-defense&quot; theory was a theory that negated an element of the offense and was not a self-defense issue for the jury. Finally, defendant argued that he was subjected to ineffective assistance of counsel because his lawyer failed to request a jury instruction on self-defense. However, because there was no evidence to merit an instruction on self-defense, counsel's performance in not requesting one was not deficient. The decision of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants owned a 24 acre property which appellee school district's board of trustees had voted to negotiate to purchase for a new high school. After appellants allegedly spent $ 151,000 to obtain the permits necessary to develop the property, appellee purchased a different tract of land. Appellants sued for damages, alleging breach of contract, promissory estoppel, breach of the duty of good faith negotiation, fraud, gross negligence, and a taking under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 17. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that an independent school district carries out only governmental functions, and, consequently in entitled to governmental immunity. The court held that estoppel can apply only to governmental units that exercise proprietary functions. In addition, the court held that the mere initiation of condemnation proceedings was but an incidental damage that was not compensable as a taking or damage even though it may interfere with the marketability of the property. Finally, the court held that permitting a suit directly against a governmental unit that has acted illegally would effectively gut the provisions of the Texas Tort Claims Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, individually and as executor of the estate of the deceased, and others, appealed from a take-nothing summary judgment. The judgment was rendered on the ground that limitations barred appellants' action to hold appellee doctor liable for the death of the deceased. Appellants alleged that the death was directly and proximately caused by appellee's negligent diagnosis and medical treatment. The reviewing court affirmed. The court held that in an action founded on a health care liability claim of misdiagnosis or mistreatment, the operative limitation period for redress was Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (1991), regardless of the alleged extent of the health care injury. The court rejected appellants' argument that the application of &sect; 10.01 placed an impossible burden on them by cutting off the wrongful death action before it accrued. The court concluded that application of &sect; 10.01 had not denied appellants access to the court; the statute merely limited the time in which they could file suit. Appellants had more than one year to file their health care liability claim after they knew appellee could have been guilty of medical malpractice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The take-nothing summary judgment in favor of appellee doctor was affirmed. Appellants had more than one year to file their health care liability claim after knowledge that appellee could have been guilty of medical malpractice; therefore, the limitation period was not unconstitutionally applied.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged the trial court's decision; however the appellate court affirmed the trial court's decision convicting defendant. The appellate court held that the trial court did not err by not sustaining defendant's objection to state's argument, wherein state asked jurors to place themselves in the position of the complainant because the record reflected that the trial court did admonish state for making the argument. The appellate court further overruled defendant's objection that state's argument was so inflammatory and prejudicial during the punishment stage that in the interest of justice his cause should be reversed even though defendant's counsel failed to object at trial because state's argument was not improper at this stage. Moreover, appellate court held that defendant was not denied the effective assistance of counsel on the ground that his counsel failed to object to the &quot;in their shoes&quot; argument because it has already been determined that such comments were not objectionable.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 179d (Supp. 1991), to be unconstitutional and awarding attorney's fees to appellee veterans' organization.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, state comptroller and alcoholic beverage commission, denied a bingo license to appellee veterans' organization, on the ground that it met neither the definition of a fraternal organization under &sect; 2(4)(A)(iv) of the Bingo Enabling Act (the Act), Tex.

The trial court declared &sect; 2(4)(A)(iv) unconstitutional, enjoined appellants from enforcing the provision, and awarded appellee attorney's fees. Appellants sought review of the decision. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that &sect; 2(4)A)(iv) unconstitutionally made a distinction without a rational basis.

On appeal the court affirmed appellant's conviction. The court rejected appellant's argument that the law was void for vagueness, holding that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague simply because appellant did not know in advance within what range of penalties appellant would actually be charged because the statute sufficiently described the offense, giving a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that the contemplated conduct was forbidden. The court held that appellant's argument concerning the doctrine of in pari materia was misplaced because two conflicting statutes were not involved. The court further held that the evidence was sufficient to establish appellant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court rejected appellant's final point of error, holding that the state's questioning regarding appellant's silence was not reversible error because the issue was not properly preserved for review.</SPAN></P>

Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 481.102(3)(D), 481.115(a),(b) (1991) and sentenced to 30 years in prison. He appealed his conviction and alleged that the evidence was insufficient to show that he knowingly possessed cocaine; that his conviction for possession of an unusable amount of cocaine violated his rights to due process, due course, and equal protection of the law; that his due process rights were violated because there was no reasonable basis to prohibit the possession of an unusable quantity of cocaine; and that punishment for possession of an unusable amount of cocaine was cruel and unusual. The court affirmed the conviction and found that a rational fact finder could conclude that appellant knowingly possessed cocaine. The court also determined that the &sect; 481.115 did not violate due process because it had a rational relation to the legitimate legislative purpose of deterring distribution and use of cocaine. Likewise, appellant's equal protection rights were not violated because there was no class discrimination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property brought an appeal of the assessed tax liability owed on its property. Appellees, the appraisal district and review board, argued that the appeal should be dismissed as the statutorily required prerequisite taxes had not been paid. The court found that appellant had paid no taxes due prior to the statutory delinquency date found in Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 42.08 (1991). The court concluded that appellant violated the provisions of &sect; 42.08, and affirmed, holding that the trial court's dismissal of appellant's suit was proper. The court ruled that the language of &sect; 42.08 was clear and that the trial court only followed the mandatory provisions of the statute. The court also found that appellant's claim that &sect; 42.08 was unconstitutional under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 was without merit. The court ruled that to qualify for redress, a litigant must show that it had a cognizable common law cause of action that was being restricted, and that the restriction was unreasonable or arbitrary when balanced against the purpose and basis of &sect; 42.08. The court found that appellant did not claim a cognizable common law cause of action, but challenged a statutory scheme.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant surety sought review of the trial court's judgments against him in three separate bond forfeitures. Appellant challenged the assessment of prejudgment interest against him, contending that the assessment was a violation of his due process rights. The court overruled this point of error, holding that the assessment against appellant was not prejudgment interest but interest that accrued from the date of the forfeiture. The reference to prejudgment interest in Tex. Code. Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 22.16 referred only to the rate at which the interest accrued. Furthermore, that statute was no longer in conflict with Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2372p-3, &sect; 13(b), because the latter statute had been declared unconstitutional by the criminal court of appeals. The court affirmed the judgments of the trial court, reforming the judgments in two of the cases to assess interest from the date of the judgment nisi only until the case disposition date, after which appellant had no liability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for intentionally selling obscene materials, knowing their content. His motion to quash the complaint was denied, and he was found guilty after a plea of nolo contendere. The trial court assessed punishment at three days confinement and a $ 500 fine. On appeal, the court affirmed. Based on prior case law upholding the constitutionality of the Texas obscenity statutes, the court overruled defendant's argument that the statutes were overbroad. Because defendant failed to direct the court's attention to any specific statutory language alleged to be indefinite, vague, and uncertain, the court overruled defendant's argument that the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash the complaint because the statutes were uncertain, indefinite, and vague. Finally, the court overruled defendant's contention that the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash the complaint because there was not a timely and proper determination of obscenity. The court found that by his plea of nolo contendere, defendant admitted every element of the offense.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied appellant relief and appellant filed an appeal. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment against appellant.

The court found that, at the time of the election, appellee's directors were properly serving and had the authority to call the election. The court considered appellant's contention that appellee failed to comply with the statute in conducting the election. The court concluded that appellant presented no evidence that appellee's failure to strictly comply with the statute materially interfered with the election and the right of the electors freely to participate therein. In considering appellant's challenge to the qualifications of the voters, the court explained that, in order to prevail, appellant had to prove not only that voting irregularities occurred, but also that they materially affected the results of the election.

Six years later, appellant was extradited from Nevada and returned to Texas. Appellant was indicted for aggravated kidnapping. Appellant executed a number of speedy trial waivers. Following a jury trial, appellant was convicted for aggravated robbery and aggravated kidnapping and this appeal followed. The court affirmed appellant's convictions. The lower court properly granted the state's challenge for cause of two prospective jurors. The state's argument to the jury was improper, but it was harmless error. Appellant's indictment for aggravated kidnapping was presented within the statute of limitations because the limitations period was tolled by appellant's absence from the state. The indictment met the constitutional and statutory definitions of an indictment and it was not fundamentally flawed. The court held that appellant's constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated because appellant made no showing that the state's delay was prejudicial. The court held that the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 51.14 was inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

The lower court added prejudgment interest under the Texas Tort Claims Act, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 101.021 (1986).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee guardian's son was involved in an accident that caused severe brain damage. Appellee prevailed at trial, and appellant hospital brought an appeal. The appellate court held that the son's damages were predicated on appellant hospital's negligent use of medical records that resulted in a failure of the doctor to timely diagnose the son's fractured hip. The appellate court found that sufficient evidence existed to show that the misuse of the son's medical charts, improper interpretation of them, was a proximate cause of the damages. The court sustained that portion of appellee guardian's cross-point that complained about the lower court's failure to award postjudgment interest, reformed the lower court's judgment to reflect the award of postjudgment interest beginning from the date of judgment, and otherwise affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1934, a surface owner of land governed by the Relinquishment Act (Act), 1919 Tex. Gen. Laws, ch. 81, negotiated an oil and gas lease. Pursuant to the Act, the owner and appellant state shared the consideration paid by the lessee. Subsequently, the owner acquired a larger interest in the mineral estate. Fifty-six years later, appellant sued appellees, the successors of the landowner and his colleagues, for a share of that mineral interest and of the owner's profits. The trial court granted summary judgment for appellees. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court concluded that a 1934 Relinquishment Act landowner owed appellant only those duties expressly set forth in the Act and not a fiduciary duty. Even if a 1934 surface owner did owe appellant a fiduciary duty, the court held, the owner in this case did not owe that duty to appellant at the time of the mineral transactions because his representation had terminated. The court noted that this termination resulted from the failure to offset drainage, from the imposition of a receivership, and from the execution of a subsequent lease.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and fined after bench trial for failure to complete repairs on a moved-in building within 150 days, a misdemeanor under Houston, Tex. Ordinances &sect; 10-49 (1985). He appealed to the county criminal court, which affirmed the judgment. On appeal, defendant contended the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and, therefore, voided. He also contended the trial court erred in assessing a fine because the only penalty provided under the ordinance was demolition of the building at the owner's expense. The court affirmed. The court held defendant failed to challenge the constitutionality of the ordinance in his motion for new trial. Tex. Gov't Code 30.269(c) stated that the motion for new trial must set forth the points of error of which defendant complained and, for the purpose of appeal, a point not distinctly set forth in the motion was waived. There was no objection to the vagueness of the ordinance; therefore, the constitutional complaint was waived by the terms of the statute. The court further held no authority was cited, nor was the ordinance included in the brief on appeal. Thus, the court could not address defendant's second point of error.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the language in former art. 4476-15 &sect; 5.07(a) was directory and not mandatory. Therefore, the trial court erred in granting appellee's motion for summary judgment on the basis that no hearing was set within 30 days of the date appellee filed his answer.

The state's petition complied fully with every element of Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 53.04 (1986). The state's determinate sentencing statutes, including Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 53.045, 54.04, under which appellant was sentenced did not violate his federal constitutional rights to equal protection and due process. The determinate sentencing statutes furthered a compelling state interest by striking a balance between the state's interest in providing for the care of its children and its interest in providing security for citizens in general. Appellant's argument that the potential of impropriety existed in the prosecutor's exercise of the determinate sentencing statutes presented nothing for review. Appellant was not twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense. The state's motion to dismiss a previous delinquency petition for the same conduct meant there was no adjudication on the merits. Appellant's failure to obtain a ruling on his objection to the prosecutor's inappropriate terminology meant the error was not preserved for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction from the Criminal District Court No. 1 of Tarrant County (Texas) of the offense of harmful access to a computer in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 33.03 (1985). Defendant challenged the admissibility of the computer generated records and the constitutionality of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 33.03.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly after defendant was fired, someone accessed his computer terminal using his password and security clearance. Computer logs indicated that actions taken during the unauthorized access triggered malevolent software responsible for destroying payroll data. A jury convicted defendant of harmful access to a computer in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 33.03, sentenced him to seven years probation, and ordered him to pay restitution. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that defendant's objection to testimony about the computer search was properly overruled because the witness need not be qualified as an expert or present printouts in order to testify as to the results of the computer search. The court also held that computer printouts were the results of an automatic recording device. Because there was no reliance upon human input, the determination that such computer self-generated data was not hearsay was in accord with Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 801. The court further held that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 33.03 was constitutional as applied to defendant because it was not too vague to inform him that his conduct was criminal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of the offense of harmful access to a computer. The court held that the payroll record was not hearsay because it was not activated automatically; it was not the result of the observations entered into the device by the declarant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bank brought suit against appellees, county and tax-assessor-collector, for a refund of taxes it paid on bank stock under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 11.02(d) (1982). The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, and appellant sought review. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that appellant's protest under Tex. Tax Code Ann.&sect; 31.11 (1982) did not preserve its right to contest the ownership of the stock under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 41.41 (1982), and that because appellant's denial of ownership was unrelated to the constitutionality of the tax, appellant had not exhausted its administrative remedies so as to be eligible for judicial relief. The court found that under &sect; 41.41, appellant was required to file a notice protesting ownership no later than the 30th day after the date the notice of taxes was delivered to it, and that its notice was therefore untimely. The court also held that appellant's pleadings of fraud, duress, and mutual mistake were affirmative defenses rather than claims for affirmative relief, and that appellant had failed to raise fact issues in its summary judgment proof on these questions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of County Criminal Court No. 8, Dallas County, Texas, which convicted him of the offense of promotion of obscene material and assessed a fine of $ 2,000. The transcript contained an order signed by the trial judge granting defendant's pretrial motion to declare Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect;43.21-43.23 (1989) unconstitutional and to dismiss the cause against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court abated defendant's appeal and ordered the trial court on remand to determine the circumstances underlying the trial court's action with respect to defendant's pretrial motion to declare Tex.

The statement of facts showed that the trial judge orally denied the motion, but signed an order granting it. Because dismissal of a case was a jurisdictional matter and could not be waived, the court held that defendant did not waive his point of error by failing to object to the continuation of the trial and participating in it. The court suggested that, if the order was signed as the result of clerical error, it could be corrected. The court held that the decision regarding the clerical or judicial nature of any error was a question of law. However, because the court could not make fact determinations, it remanded the case to the trial court for a factual determination either that the written order truthfully reflected what actually occurred or that it was inaccurate for certain specified reasons.</SPAN></P>

The lower court dismissed the action pursuant to Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction of the offense of possession of a controlled substance, cocaine, weighing less than 28 grams. The court held that pretrial hearings were discretionary under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 28.01 &sect; 1 (1989). The court added that mere allegations not supported by evidence could not have considered on appeal, and failures to object at trial left nothing to review, including the admission of an open blue warrant. There was no pre-trial procedure to test the sufficiency of the evidence. Noting that the Speedy Trial Act, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32A.01 and 32.02, was declared unconstitutional, the court also decided that appellant was not prejudiced by any delays. The court found he failed to meet the requirements of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 24.13 (1989) to obtain witnesses in the custody of the state. The court decided the state could have used hypotheticals to assure prospective jurors were able to consider the full range of punishment. The court found no prosecutorial misconduct and noted that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07 &sect; 3(a) (1991) permitted admission of appellant's record at the punishment phase.</SPAN></P>

The case was extensively covered in the news, both on television and in print. During his trial for murder, appellant filed a motion for a change of venue due to the publicity surrounding the case. The trial court denied appellant's motion, and he was convicted of capital murder. Appellant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to change venue and that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 8.07 (d) (1991) was unconstitutional because juveniles convicted of capital murder only had one possible punishment, life in prison. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's motion for a change of venue, as only two of appellant's five witnesses indicated that appellant could not get a fair trial in Brazos County (Texas) and coverage of the case had been reduced prior to trial. Appellant's position that &sect; 8.07 was unconstitutional was overruled, as he cited no authority to support his position.</SPAN></P>

The court found that appellants had sufficient notice of the trial setting and that appellants had not presented a valid reason for not appearing. In addition, the court found that appellant principal had not appeared on the former trial setting date and had not appeared any time in the 20 months between judgment nisi and final judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee widow had her husband's body moved from one section of appellee corporation's cemetery to another section of the cemetery.

The court reformed the judgment to reflect that appellant was the real party plaintiff, and as reformed, affirmed the judgment. The court concluded that appellant actively appeared in his representative capacity on behalf of the party plaintiff in the case. The court held that under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner sought review of a judgment from the 295th District Court, Harris County (Texas), which granted appellant interest on a condemnation award fund and also granted appellant attorney's fees. Appellant challenged the amount of attorney's fees as inadequate. Appellees, county and county officials, cross-appealed the award of interest on the award fund and the award of attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner deposited money into the registry of the trial court to challenge appellee county's right to condemn his land. Appellee county officials held the money for over two years until appellant withdrew it. When appellee county retained the interest earned on the money, appellant filed a declaratory judgment action asking the trial court to declare the owner of the interest. The trial court determined that appellant was entitled to the interest and attorney's fees. Both appellant and appellees sought review of the judgment. Appellant argued that the jury awarded an inadequate amount as attorney's fees. Concluding that the evidence was factually insufficient to support the amount of attorney's fees, the court reversed the portion of the judgment that awarded attorney's fees and remanded for a new trial on that issue alone. The court affirmed the remainder of the judgment, rejecting appellees' challenge to the interest award. Although appellee county was permitted to show the amount it was due for accounting and administrative expenses, it failed to do so and thus waived any right it had to any portion of the interest.</SPAN></P>

The district court granted and later dissolved the injunction.

Both appellant and appellees filed motions for summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment to appellees with respect to appellant's right to adjudicate the dispute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of conspiracy with the intent to commit the offense of aggravated delivery of cocaine over 400 grams based on jury verdict. Appellant presented five points of error on appeal, including that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss that some of the prosecution's peremptory challenges were based impermissibly on race, and that the trial court erred in its charges to the jury. Appellant, who was of Hispanic origin, objected to the prosecution's challenges directed at three African-American veniremembers. The appellate court noted that the appeals court had, in applying the Batson factors, held that a defendant could not complain unless the excluded veniremembers were of the same race as the defendant. Appellant contended that Tex. Code Crim. P. art. 35.261 had different requirements than Batson and therefore permitted cross-racial strikes. The appellate court held, after an examination of the legislative history, that appellant's contentions were not well founded. The court also rejected appellant's claims that the trial court had incorrectly charged the jury. As such, the court affirmed the lower court's decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the 219th District Court Collin County, Texas, convicting appellant for burglary of a habitation and engaging in organized criminal activity. On each count, the trial court admitted appellant's confessions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of burglary of a habitation, with a sentence of 15 years in prison, and engaging in organized criminal activity, with a sentence of 60 years in prison. Appellant challenged both convictions, and the court reversed each. As to burglary, the court found that appellant's own description of the location of the burglary was vague, no exact dates were mentioned, no property taken in the burglary was found in appellant's possession, and no other evidence supported the conviction. Therefore, the court found it was not supported by sufficient evidence, and rendered a judgment of acquittal. As to organized criminal activity, the court found that the state had not shown that appellant's confession was voluntary, where appellant claimed he was beaten and the arresting officers did not testify at the suppression hearing to contradict this. In addition, the arresting officers did testify at trial, placing appellant in a dilemma under the Fifth Amendment, because he would be required to give up his right to refuse to testify in order to debate the voluntariness of his confession. Consequently, the court reversed and remanded this charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and remanded in part. Appellant was acquitted of burglary of a habitation, because there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction. Appellant's written confessions were improperly admitted on the trial for engaging in organized criminal activity, because the state failed to demonstrate that the confessions were voluntary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bondsman issued an appearance bond. The principal failed to appear and the trial court entered a judgment of forfeiture. Law enforcement officials eventually apprehended the principal. Appellant filed a motion for remittitur after forfeiture in the amount of the bond less costs and interest. The trial court granted partial remittitur in the amount of 50 percent of the bond less costs. Appellant sought review and the court affirmed. The court first determined that the bond was valid because its language provided sufficient identification of the court and the nature of the bonded offense. The court also determined that the trial court did not err when it refused to apply a waiting period specified by statute because that portion of the statute had previously been declared unconstitutional. Finally, the court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion, when it ordered only a 50 percent remittitur, because there was no showing of sufficient cause for the principal's absence, the principal was not apprehended through the efforts of appellant, and appellant had received compensation for the risk appellant endured under the bond.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. Partial remittitur on forfeited bail bond was proper when bondsman failed to show sufficient cause for principal's absence, principal was not apprehended through efforts of bondsman, and bondsman was compensated for risk assumed under bond.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed from three orders of the County Court at Law No. 2 (Texas) granting motions to quash three misdemeanor complaints charging appellee with disorderly conduct. The state argued that the trial court abused its discretion in finding Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 42.01(a)(2) (1989) unconstitutionally overboard as applied to appellee in the absence of facts to support such findings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was charged with disorderly conduct in three separate but identical complaints. Appellee pled no contest, then perfected appeals to the trial court. In the trial court, appellee filed identical motions to quash the complaints. The trial court granted all three motions to quash. On appeal, the state argued that the trial court abused its discretion in finding Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 42.01(a)(2) (1989) unconstitutionally overboard as applied to appellee in the absence of facts to support such findings. The appeals court dismissed the state's appeals. The court reasoned that the appeals were filed 16 days after the trial court signed and entered the orders. Because the state had no legal power to appeal the cases once the 15-day limit set out in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 44.01(d) had expired, the court erred in granting the state's motion to extend time for filing the notices of appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sued appellee corrections department, director, and other officials under Tex. Civ.

Appellant argued that the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing appellant's application for an injunction without a hearing upon an unverified pleading. Appellant urged that because appellee director's pleadings were unverified, Tex. R. Civ. P. 690 required that a final hearing be conducted before appellant's petition was dismissed. The appeals court affirmed. The court ruled that the &quot;final hearing&quot; required by Tex. R. Civ. P. 690 was necessary only where the defendant was seeking to have a temporary injunction abated on the basis of allegations contained in his or her non-verified answer, thereby preventing a defendant from dissolving a temporary injunction already in place without proof verified by the oath of the defendant.

The trial court entered judgment for appellees. On appeal, appellant contended the trial court erred because appellees renounced or modified their right to notice of the resale. The appeals court affirmed. The court ruled that the attorney's letter did not constitute a modification or renunciation under Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code &sect; 9.504 (1991) because it was not signed by appellees and did not mention a waiver of their right to notice. Moreover, because the notice sent by appellant contained a different date than the actual date of sale, there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether appellees received reasonable notice. Thus, because damages were specifically provided for in the statute, appellees were not required to prove actual damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought relief from his conviction in the 227th District Court of Bexar County (Texas) for the murder of his estranged wife and her friend.

When his wife and a friend entered the apartment, they were shot and killed. Appellant was indicted separately for the offenses, which were consolidated for trial, and he was convicted of murder. The court affirmed conviction, finding no error by the trial court in consolidating the two causes for trial, in overruling the motion to quash the indictments for failure to give notice which particular gun was used in the deaths of the victims, and in not declaring mistrial when insurance was mentioned. The court held that the trial court did not err in requiring appellant to turn over his statement of the case to state after it had been used by his psychiatrist expert witness, on not appointing a psychiatrist until eleven days before trial, and in allowing state to call rebuttal witnesses. The court held it was not improper to permit a police officer to testify regarding how long he believed the alleged victims had been dead at the time he arrived at the scene.</SPAN></P>

The court found that appellee's failure to follow the mandates of the act resulted in reversible error because appellant was deprived of a hearing to determine whether the lower court would enjoin any unlawful employment practice, deprived of a hearing to determine whether it had failed to comply with an order of a court, deprived of the equitable principles with which a court, but not a jury, was familiar, and deprived of any consideration of the credits to which it was entitled for payments made.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant went to his bedroom and, in the dark, emptied the bullets out of the barrel of his gun. He then returned with the gun to show his friends. While walking back to his bedroom pulling the gun's trigger, one friend stepped in front of him and appellant accidentally shot and killed him. Appellant was unaware that his gun was still loaded. Appellant and convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Appellant challenged his conviction, arguing error in denying his pretrial motion to halt the felony prosecution and his post-trial motion to set aside his conviction because the legislature's attempt to distinguish between culpable mental states for recklessness and for criminal negligence were distinctions without difference. Appellant argued that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.05(a)(1), was unconstitutional as applied. The court affirmed the conviction, holding Tex. Penal Code &sect; 6.03(c), and Tex. Penal Code &sect; 6.03(d), did not define the same culpable mental states, nor did one definition include any portion of the other. The court held that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.05(a)(1), and Tex. Penal Code &sect; 19.07 (1989), did not penalize the same conduct.</SPAN></P>

The court originally reversed his conviction, holding that the trial court erred in refusing to give his requested jury instruction as to his good faith purchase defense.

The court held that the requested instruction was sufficient to put the trial court on notice, but that the charge was sufficient and the error in omitting the statutory definition of mistake of fact set forth in Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 8.02(a) (1974), was harmless. The court held that it was not error to submit a charge on the law of parties because it limited the application of the presumption of knowledge to appellant and his mental state and not to appellant's son.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant convicted of disorderly conduct contended on review that her trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance, that the municipal court should have quashed her complaint, that the statute under which she was charged was unconstitutionally vague, and that the words she used were not fighting words. The court held that appellant failed to show a deficiency in her counsel's actions and that she was prejudiced. The court concluded that counsel's acts or omissions were not outside the range of professional competent assistance and that a different outcome would not have occurred but for his actions. The court also found that the municipal court correctly overruled appellant's motion to quash. The court reasoned that the statute under which appellant was charged was not too vague. The court held that the statute provided explicit standards. The court found that the state introduced sufficient evidence to show that appellant's words not only tended to incite a breach of the peace, but that she actually did incite a breach of the peace. The court also held that a review of the record showed that the state met its burden of proof. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested for retaliation. An officer testified that appellant on several occasions was verbally abusive toward him and threatened him. Appellant was convicted of retaliation under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 36.061 (1990). Appellant was placed on felony probation for five years. Less than a year later the state filed a motion to revoke appellant's probation based on allegations he had failed to report to his probation officer, failed to secure employment, and failed to pay probation supervisory fees. Following a hearing, the trial court revoked appellant's probation and sentenced him to five years confinement. Appellant challenged the revocation of probation, arguing the evidence of retaliation was insufficient to support his conviction, and that the statute he was convicted under was unconstitutional. The court found that appellant's sufficiency argument could not be raised, that the argument that the statute was facially unconstitutional was without merit, and that appellant's threat was not protected speech. The court concluded appellant's other points of error were waived when he failed to appeal original conviction. The case was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, appellants complained of physical injury from excessive television noise emanating from five televisions located adjacent to their living cells but beyond their view. The trial court dismissed their pro se in forma pauperis action pursuant to Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 13.001. Appellants complained the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing their suit. The court found that in forma pauperis complaints could be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1915(d) when they sought to relitigate claims already unsuccessfully litigated. Since one appellant had initiated such suit and it was not brought to the trial court's attention, the court could not consider it. The court found that appellants failed to allege the deprivation of a valid constitutional right. A noise-free prison environment was not a fundamental right and appellants were clearly not members of a suspect class. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted an injunction, and actual and punitive fees to appellee doctor and his family, in an action for negligent infliction of emotional distress arising from appellants' picketing of appellees' residence. On appeal, appellants challenged the injunction's constitutionality. They argued that the injunction violated U.S. Const. amend. I and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.The court found that the injunction constituted a content-neutral, narrowly tailored limitation on the place and manner of appellants' expressive activities and ample alternative avenues of communication existed. The court overruled this point of error. Appellants further challenged the constitutionality of the award of actual and punitive damages. The court found that appellees were not public figures and thus might not recover damages for emotional harm negligently caused by the exercise of expressive activity protected by U.S. Const. amend.

Appellant companies filed suit in the trial court seeking a declaration as to the validity and applicability of the ratable take and proration rules promulgated by appellee. After a trial on the merits, the trial court rendered judgment that appellee did not exceed its authority by enacting the rules, but dismissed the cause for lack of ripeness. The court initially reversed the trial court's dismissal, but following an appeal the court was directed to rule on whether appellee's rules were valid. Appellants argued that federal law preempted the challenged rules. The court agreed and held that the rules were invalid. The rules in question came within the limits of the comprehensive Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 3301-3432, scheme, and they conflicted with the federal interest in low gas prices.

On appeal, the lower court judgment was affirmed. In support of its ruling, the court held that it could find no authority that provided that when an appellate court reversed and remanded a specific order, a new trial of the entire case was necessary. The court further explained that such a result would violate logic, judicial economy, and the rights of the parties. The court, thus, found that it seemed clear that such a reversal and remand was limited to specific fact issues did not reopen the case in its entirely.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state condemned a portion of appellees landowners' property in order to widen a state highway. All matters, aside from the issue of adequate consideration, were determined before trial.

The trial court also denied appellant's judgment of proof as to value, and the jury returned a verdict, assessing the value of the condemned land. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court ruled that, based on Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 17, the land taken from the state was to be valued without consideration of surrounding land. Moreover, the court held that Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect; 21.042(e), which provided for considering any benefit that arose from the highway improvement in considering the value of condemned land, was unconstitutional and inapplicable because the Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 17 could not be changed without constitutional amendment or a finding by the Texas Supreme Court that such a change was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant loaned appellee four advances of funds. Appellant agreed to finance the loan over a period of seven years, at fifteen percent interest per annum. The loan agreement between the parties was oral. Appellant testified that they decided the monthly payment amount based on an amortization book. Appellee did not execute a promissory note or any other instrument evidencing the loan. After the terms of the loan had been agreed upon, appellant gave appellee a printed amortization schedule setting forth the amount of the loan, the rate of interest, and the required payment amount under the original agreement. After appellee made eight payments, he quit paying on the loan. Appellant filed suit against appellee. The trial court awarded appellant the balance due on the note less the penalty for usurious interest set forth in Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 5069. The trial court concluded that the interest charged on the loan was usurious as a matter of law. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's decision because the oral agreement exceeded the maximum legal rate of interest that the parties could have agreed upon orally for the loan which was ten percent per annum.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the decision awarding appellant the balance due on the defaulted note and loan agreement between appellant and appellee less the statutory penalty for usurious interest because the trial court was justified in determining that the parties merely intended and used the amortization schedule as evidence of the prior completed oral contract of the loan transaction, thus the fifteen percent loan rate was usurious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bondsman entered into 12 separate bail bonds conditioned on the appearance of defendants in each case. After the defendants failed to appear a judgment nisi was entered against appellant and the defendants. The state mailed appellant a bill directing him to pay interest calculated from the judgment nisi date to the entry of the final judgment remitting the bond. Appellant contested the assessment of interest. Appellant argued that it was improper to assess prejudgment interest prior to the final judgment because there was no ascertainable sum due until that point. The appellate court disagreed and concluded that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 22.16(e) (1989) did not actually provide for prejudgment interest, but rather required payment of interest on the bond amount. The court also stated that the date of forfeiture was the date the defendants failed to appear and not the final judgment date. The court did remand two of the bail bonds to the trial court because those bonds were not subject to the new version of art. 22.16 and the old version did not permit interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought relief from the dismissal of his pro se application for writ of habeas corpus by the trial court, pursuant to Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp;b Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 13.001 (1990), on the grounds that it was frivolous. Appellant claimed the statute under which the trial court dismissed his complaint was unconstitutional, but the court held that ruling on the constitutionality of the statute was not necessary to decide the case and therefore declined to rule on it. The court found that appellant did not challenge the legality of his confinement but only complained of the terms and conditions of his imprisonment and certain management acts and that the record showed no illegal restraint for which habeas corpus relief could be granted. The court ruled that the trial court did not err in dismissing appellant's application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In defendant's trial for driving while intoxicated, the arresting officer testified concerning defendant's appearance and physical condition. Defendant's vehicle was impounded and searched. The court held that defendant's motion to suppress evidence found in the search of his vehicle was properly denied because it was incident to defendant's arrest. A certified breath test operator testified that he performed an intoxilyzer test that showed an alcohol concentration of 0.18 percent. The breath test technical supervisor testified that the machine upon which defendant was tested was approved and certified, that the intoxilyzer operated on generally accepted scientific principles, and was regarded as accurate by the scientific community. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701l-5, &sect; 3(a)(b), and the Texas Breath Alcohol Testing Regulations. The court found that the provisions ensured accuracy and did not violate due process. The court held that the jury was free to disregard testimony from defendant's experts and that evidence presented by the state was sufficient for the admissibility of the test results.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for driving while intoxicated was affirmed because the statutes provided for the admissibility of intoxilyzer results and the rulemaking authority given to the Department of Public Safety was not an unconstitutional delegation of authority and the regulations promulgated ensured the accuracy of the tests and did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant drove his vehicle into the rear of a school bus that was unloading children. He was convicted of felony driving while intoxicated. On appeal, the court held that, absent a showing of bad faith, state's failure to preserve a blood sample so that he could have an ethanol concentration test performed did not constitute a denial of due process. The court held that appellant was not entitled to an instruction on voluntariness under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.22, &sect; 7, because appellant was not under custodial interrogation when he admitted drinking before the collision. The court held that appellant failed to preserve error on several issues because he failed to provide any supporting authority, failed to object at trial, or it concerned evidence admitted without objection by another source. The court held that state could comment on the failure of appellant to call witnesses who were available to testify, could answer opposing counsel's arguments, and could summarize the evidence presented. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to support appellant's conviction based on eyewitness testimony, medical records, and appellant's own admission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A bank sued appellee leasing corporation for the collection of three promissory notes, originally executed by appellee and later assumed by two individuals. The notes were collateralized by certain equipment. Based on the bank's advice, appellee delivered the equipment to the two individuals after they assumed the notes. No additional financing statements were filed. Thereafter, the equipment disappeared. Appellee countersued for, among other things, fraud and breach of fiduciary duty. The jury found in appellee's favor. The bank was declared insolvent while the appeal was pending. Appellant federal deposit insurance corporation was appointed receiver and was substituted as a party to the appeal. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case so that appellant could seek collection on the notes. Appellee's claims failed as a matter of federal law. Appellant's appointment as receiver, while the appeal was pending, caused all evidence introduced at trial of matters extraneous to banking records to have been erroneously admitted, and appellee could not rely on any defenses arising out of representations which were not evidenced in the official loan documents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a city and a corporation, challenged the trial court's entry of declaratory judgment in favor of appellee corporation deciding the competing claims of appellant corporation and appellee regarding a permit for the operation of a sexually-oriented business. Appellants argued that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to grant the declaratory relief. The court reversed the trial court's declaratory judgment and remanded with instructions to dismiss appellee's counterclaim for declaratory relief. The trial court lacked jurisdiction to construe the sexually-oriented business ordinance because appellee's allegation that the ordinance was wrongfully interpreted did not confer jurisdiction upon the trial court to render declaratory relief. Appellee did not plead that the ordinance was unconstitutional or that its enforcement would result in irreparable harm to a vested properly right. The trial court did not have jurisdiction to review appellant city's administrative decision that denied appellee's permit application. The ordinance was enacted pursuant to Tex.

The court found that the monthly charge to owners of vacant lots adjacent to the water and sewer system, but not hooked on to the system, constituted an illegal tax to the owners. Appellants also argued that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding appellee attorney's fees. The court held that the trial court had discretion in the award of attorney's fees.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bail bond company sought review of the judgment of the trial court in a bond forfeiture case by filing a writ of error.

Appellant also argued that the trial court improperly awarded prejudgment and postjudgment interest. The appellate court modified the judgment to delete the award of prejudgment and postjudgment interest and affirmed the judgment in all other respects. The appellate court noted that it had previously held art. 22.16(c)(2) to be unconstitutional and declined to reconsider that holding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following his conviction of aggravated sexual assault and indecency with a child, appellant sought review and asserted that the trial court erred in overruling his objection to the testimony of a four-year-old victim because she did not demonstrate that she was competent to testify under the standard set forth in Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 601. The court held that the competence of a child witness was generally a question for the trial court and its ruling would not be disturbed on appeal unless an abuse of discretion was shown. After examining the record, the court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's decision that the child witness was competent. Appellant also contended that the trial court erred in conducting the competency hearing in the presence of the jury on the ground that Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 104(a) required a competency hearing to be held outside the presence of the jury. The court disagreed and held that because appellant never objected during the competency hearing, the issue was not preserved for appellate review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for organized crime participation claiming that the 188th Judicial District Court of Gregg County (Texas) erred in convicting him under the activity organized crime statute, Tex. Penal Ann. Code &sect; 71.01(a) (1989), contending the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it did not define the word collaborate. Defendant also claimed various errors amounting to insufficiency of evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for his participation in organized criminal activities. He claimed that the conviction should be set aside because the statute on which it was based was unconstitutionally vague, he was entitled to a separate trial, and because voir dire was improperly conducted. The court in affirming held that Tex. Penal Code &sect; 71.01(a)(1989) was not unconstitutionally vague because persons of ordinary intelligence could understand its meaning. It also held that severance was not required when defendant failed to show that he would be prejudiced by a shared trial. In addition, the court said that voir dire was not improper because the trial court had discretion over how to conduct it, and prosecutor's comments were not unfairly prejudicial during cross-examination and closing arguments. The court also held that demonstrative evidence used but not admitted at trial was not subject to error, and that when defendant failed to object about evidence at trial, he waived any right to appeal that error. Finally, the court held that any comment made by judge was cured by instruction to jury by trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's racketeering conviction. It held that no reversible error occurred when the trial court failed to sever trial, refused to find the statute was unconstitutional, allowed demonstrative evidence to be used at trial, and when it overruled objections regarding voir dire, witness statements, and statements by prosecutor and judge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the 219th District Court, Collin County (Texas), which convicted him of aggravated sexual assault pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.021 (1989), after a trial in which expert testimony regarding the psychological profile of the victim's assailant was admitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.021 (1989). The court held that expert testimony regarding the psychological profile of the assailant was inadmissible under Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 702, because it did not assist the jury in determining the only issues of what crime was committed or who committed the crime. The court could not say that the error was harmless under Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2), where the testimony portrayed the assailant, identified as defendant, as a repeat offender, and defendant was sentenced to 99-years imprisonment even though he had no prior convictions. The evidence was sufficient to show that the assault was aggravated where defendant forced his way into victim's apartment, repeatedly pushed her to the floor, and put a dishtowel on her face to impair her breathing. Tex. Penal Code &sect; 22.021 (1989), was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant because the victim's state of mind was not the only determinative factor. Defendant was not entitled to a lesser included offense instruction of sexual assault because there was no evidence that raised only that offense. DNA evidence was reliable and had gained acceptance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction of aggravated sexual assault. The expert testimony presenting the psychological profile of the victim's assailant was inadmissible because it did not aid jury in understanding the evidence and its prejudicial and inflammatory effect outweighed its probative value. The court could not say that the admission of this testimony did not contribute to defendant's conviction or punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of the order of the 213th Judicial District Court, Tarrant County (Texas), which dismissed its forfeiture action against appellant property owner under &sect; 5.07(a) of the Texas Controlled Substances Act because the cause had not been set for trial within 30 days of the answer date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State brought a forfeiture action against appellee property owner under the Texas Controlled Substances Act. However, state failed to secure a setting for the forfeiture proceeding within 30 days of the answer date as was required by &sect; 5.07(a) of the act. The trial court granted appellee's motion to dismiss. The court reversed the judgment, holding that the 30-day requirement of &sect; 5.07(a), was directory rather than mandatory. The court noted that its decision did not affect the date of the hearing itself, but only the setting of the date for trial. To avoid further automatic dismissals of forfeiture actions, the court overruled State v. $ 4097 in U.S. Currency, 773 S.W.2d 674 (Tex. App. 1989), which had held that &sect; 5.07(a), was mandatory. The court held that if &sect; 5.07(a), were mandatory, it violated the separation of powers doctrine set forth in Tex. Const. art. II, &sect; 1, because it was a legislative interference with the prosecutor's discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order, which had dismissed state's forfeiture action against appellee property owner, because the statutory provision requiring that the cause be set for trial within 30 days of the answer date was discretionary. The court overruled its prior decision, which had held that the provision was mandatory, because that holding rendered the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had permitted appellant to amend his pleadings to allege fraudulent concealment and so that issue was raised for appellate review pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Appellant was convicted of aggravated robbery pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 29.02. He filed an appeal and argued that the evidence was insufficient because the state failed to prove the property was taken without the effective consent of the owner. The court found that consent did not become a disputed fact issue where it was alleged, proven, and found that the owner was threatened or placed in fear of imminent bodily injury, intentionally or knowingly, by an accused in the course of the taking. The complainant testified appellant threatened her with a knife and physically removed the money from a cash drawer. When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict. The testimony was sufficient to support the inference that the complainant was in fear of bodily harm at the time of the taking. A rational trier of fact could reasonably find lack of consent on the part of the complainant by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The court overruled appellant's point of error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant son challenged a judgment from the 256th District Court, Dallas County (Texas), which dismissed appellant's suit against appellee father to rebut the presumption that appellee was the father of a child born during appellee's marriage to the child's mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant son challenged the trial court's order dismissing his suit to rebut the presumption that appellee father was the father of a child born during appellee's marriage to the child's mother, as determined in their divorce degree. The court affirmed because Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 12.06 (1990) allowed only a mother or presumed father to rebut the presumption; thus, appellant lacked any statutory means to challenge it. The court found that appellant failed to show a constitutional right to make such a challenge under due process or the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3. The court found that appellant had no constitutionally protected interest that enabled him to challenge the presumption. The court held that appellant had no fundamental interest in a relationship with the child, and the purpose of protecting children was rationally related to limiting the right to challenge paternity to the mother or presumed father. The court found that, as &sect; 12.06 precluded a man other than the mother's husband from rebutting the presumption, the classification was marriage-based and was rationally related to protecting the child.</SPAN></P>

First, the court addressed the notice of appeal, which the district attorney did not personally sign and found it was proper as amended. The state argued that the trial court erred in declaring the statute and regulations unconstitutional. The court held that the statute and regulations were not unconstitutional under any ground. The state asserted that the trial court erred in granting the motion to suppress the evidence of the intoxilyzer test because the statute and regulations were constitutional. Appellee stipulated that the test was done according to the regulations and rules and that the trial court had this stipulation when it ruled. Therefore, the trial court erred in suppressing the evidence. The state argued that the trial court should have awarded them attorney fees. The court held that attorney fees are only allowed in declaratory judgment cases not criminal cases. The court reversed the order and remanded for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a Texas corporation, had filed a breach of contract action against appellant corporation. The parties had entered into two construction contracts for projects in New Jersey and Massachusetts in which appellee had respectively its claims. Appellant then filed the declaratory judgment action in Texas alleging that appellee had violated the Texas usury statute. Appellee filed a motion to dismiss and a plea in abatement urging the Texas court to either decline to exercise its jurisdiction or abate the cause of action, in order to avoid interference with litigation involving the same parties and issues in Massachusetts. Appellant challenged the authority of the trial court to dismiss a suit for declaratory judgment in this case. The court affirmed because it was within the discretion of the trial court to refuse to enter a declaratory judgment if it would not terminate the uncertainty or controversy which gave rise to the proceeding and as a matter of comity.</SPAN></P>

The Act was subsequently amended to prohibit disclosure of such transcripts, after which, the trial court granted the writ.

The court reversed the trial court judgment, holding that appellee did not obtain a vested right to information contained in the transcripts until final judgment, which was after the Act was amended, and that the trial court erred in finding that the application of the amended Act would be an unconstitutional retroactive application of law. The trial court further erred as a matter of law in denying appellant's motion to vacate mandamus, because it did not correctly apply the applicable law.

Alco. Bev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2.01-2.03 (1990), and Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. &sect; 106.03(a) (1990). Appellants sought review. Section 2.02 required proof that the recipient's intoxication was a proximate cause of damages, otherwise the provider could not be held liable. The court affirmed, on grounds, inter alia, that appellants had not proven that appellant minor's intoxication was a cause-in-fact of their damages. The court found that the decedent minor driver's intoxication was the cause-in-fact for the accident and the resulting injuries. Appellant minor's intoxication played no part in bringing about the wreck. The court further found that Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. &sect; 2.03 (1990) set forth the exclusive cause of action for providing alcohol to a minor and summary judgment on appellants' claim of violation of Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. &sect; 106.03(a) (1990) was not error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment entered by the lower court in favor of appellee store in an action brought seeking damages for injuries resulting from the sale of alcoholic beverages to a minor. The court held that appellant minor's intoxication could not have been a cause-in-fact of the automobile accident and resulting damages, thus appellee was not liable under statute making sellers responsible for the actions of their customers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Comptroller of Public Accounts, challenged the judgment of the District Court of Travis County, 353rd Judicial District (Texas), that determined that appellee corporation was not subject to a franchise tax under the Texas Franchise Tax Act, Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 171.001 et seq., and was entitled to a refund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Comptroller of Public Accounts, changed the rule defining when a corporation was &quot;doing business in Texas&quot; and decided that appellee corporation had conducted business in Texas within the meaning of the Texas Franchise Tax Act, Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 171.001 et seq., and was subject to the corporate franchise tax. The district court disagreed, ruling that appellee was entitled to a refund. The issue on appeal was whether appellant could impose a franchise tax upon appellee pursuant to Tex. Admin. Code Ann. &sect; 3.406 (1983). Appellee contended that the language &quot;doing business in Texas&quot; was ambiguous. Considering that prior to 1983 appellant did not seek to impose the tax on corporations such as appellee, and that the franchise tax statute language had remained virtually unchanged since 1941, the court agreed. Additionally, because appellant's construction of the franchise tax law and that of appellant's predecessors was of long-standing duration, it should not have been changed absent clear statutory authorization. The court held that appellant lacked authority to impose the franchise tax upon appellee pursuant to the 1983 rule change. The judgment below was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers sought review of a judgment from the 352nd District Court of Tarrant County (Texas), which refused to award them attorney's fees upon their successful appeal of appellee taxing authorities' denial of an open-space land valuation of their real property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers challenged the trial court's refusal to award them attorney's fees upon their successful appeal of appellee taxing authorities' denial of an open-space land valuation of their real property. The court noted that attorney's fees could not be recovered unless provided for by statute or by contract between parties, and any statutory provisions allowing recovery of attorney's fees had to be subjected to strict construction. The only statutory authority permitting recovery of attorney's fees by taxpayers was Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 42.29 (1990). It was clear to the court that appellants were complaining of excessive appraisal value placed upon their properties as referred to in Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 42.25 (1982). Therefore, their successful protest entitled them to an award of attorney's fees under &sect; 42.29. The court also noted that to interpret the Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 42.24 and 42.25 not to include appeals of this kind would leave the court without statutory instruction of what to do with this type of appeal. Such a result would undermine the system of judicial review of board orders and appeals of appraisal district decisions. The judgment below was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the 183rd District Court, Harris County (Texas), which entered a final judgment against him and his surety on a bail bond. That trial court also previously overruled appellant's motion to pass setting (or motion for continuance), and appellant's prior motion for a new trial was overruled by operation of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant's bail bond was issued, a judgment nisi was entered when he failed to appear. Final judgment was entered against appellant and his surety for their failure to show sufficient cause for appellant's failure to appear. Appellant presented an unsworn motion to pass setting, which was overruled, and his subsequent motion for a new trial was overruled by operation of law. Appellant then challenged the entry of the final judgment, contending that it was premature, as Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 22.16(c)(2) required that final judgment be entered no less than 18 months after bond forfeiture in a felony case; appellant argued that art. 22.16 retroactively applied to bonds issued prior to that article's enactment. The court found that there was nothing in the language of art. 22.16 indicating that the legislature intended retroactive application. Moreover, retroactive application of the statute would have impaired the vested contractual rights of the state, under the bond agreement, and thus would have violated Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 16, which forbade retroactive application of any law impairing the obligation of contracts. The order below was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Final judgment against appellant and his surety on bail bond was affirmed. As to a statute requiring a final judgment to be entered no less than 18 months after bond forfeiture, the court found that nothing in the statute's language indicated retroactive application, and such retroactive application would have unconstitutionally impaired the vested contractual rights of the state, under its bond agreement with appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs challenged a judgment from the District Court of Harris County (Texas) that dismissed their wrongful death and survival actions as barred by the statutes of limitations. Plaintiffs filed the actions and added defendants after the death of decedent. Plaintiffs asserted that decedent's death revived the causes of action against defendants, even though the statutes of limitations had run against decedent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment that dismissed plaintiffs' survival and wrongful death suits, filed three months after decedent's death, because they were barred by statutes of limitations. Prior to his death, decedent developed silicosis as a result of his employment as a sandblaster and filed suit against several corporations that manufactured or distributed the products his employer used. After his death, plaintiff wife, as executrix of the estate, added additional plaintiffs, survival and wrongful death causes of action, and named additional defendants. The court held that a survival action was purely derivative and that when decedent's statute of limitations had run against defendants at the time of his death, the limitations period also barred the survival action. The court harmonized Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 16.003(b) and 71.003(a) by finding that one applied to the right to file a wrongful death action and one governed the time period for that suit The court held that a wrongful death action related back to an original suit filed by a decedent, so that here, where there was no original suit, there was no right to file the wrongful death action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that dismissed the actions as barred by the statute of limitations. The court held that survival action was purely derivative and that when the statute of limitations had run against decedent, the survival action was also barred. The court reconciled two statutes referencing wrongful death and found that wrongful death action must relate back to original suit, thus plaintiffs never had a right to file the suit.</SPAN></P>

They went to the address and found a gun in the common area of the apartment complex. The vehicle search came within the vehicle exception of the warrant requirement because it was readily capable for use on the highways and was found in a place not regularly used for residential purposes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for possession of less than 28 grams of cocaine and sentence to 40 years punishment enhanced by two prior convictions from the 263rd District Court, Harris County, Texas, following a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty in a jury trial of possession of less than 28 grams of cocaine and sentenced to 40 years punishment enhanced by two prior convictions. The appellate court affirmed. The court rejected defendant's contention that the state's request at punishment for a 45 year enhancement violated the ban against cruel and unusual punishment. First, defendant did not object to the request and thus the issue was waived. Also, the state's request was a proper plea for law enforcement which is allowed in closing argument, and finally, state had the discretion of choosing what charges to bring absent a finding of vindictiveness. The trial court's discussion of parole law with a juror was not an error because the jury had no power to affect parole eligibility, and defendant did not object to the discussion anyway thus waiving the issue. Defendant was not placed in double jeopardy for being twice convicted of indecency with a child. The habitual offender statute, Tex. Code Penal Ann. &sect; 12.42(d)(1990), did not constitute a double jeopardy punishment. It merely classified a more severe punishment for defendant's persistence in crime.</SPAN></P>

The state's request for the enhancement was a proper form of closing argument. The trial court's discussion of parole law with a juror was not an error because the jury had no authority to affect parole, and the repeat offender statute was not a form of double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, mother and as personal representative and heir of her adult son, brought a suit alleging common law negligence in a wrongful death and survival action, with respect to her son's death by smoke inhalation during a fire at the apartment duplex of appellants, doctor and his wife, who were owners and lessors. A judgment was entered on a jury verdict for common law negligence damages favoring appellees where negligence in failing to install a smoke detector and in failing to repair a floor furnace was claimed. The appellate court reversed the judgment of the trial court, holding that the Texas Smoke Detectors Statute provided the exclusive remedy for the absence of a smoke detector, hence the jury's negligence finding, which did not embrace the statutory scheme, was legally insufficient to support the judgment. The court held further that absent any notice by a tenant to appellants of the specified unsafe condition at the rental premises in need of repair, appellants, as landlords, were under no duty to make such repairs, and that the Texas Smoke Detectors Statute was constitutional, contending substantive due process, including equal protection, violations.</SPAN></P>

The constitutional state smoke detectors statute preempted common law negligence, and no landlord liability existed.</SPAN></P>

The court also determined that a prior judicial determination of obscenity was not an element of the offense. The court further stated that no evidence was necessary to support a finding of guilt because appellant had entered a nolo contendere plea in his two misdemeanor convictions. Finally, the court concluded that there was no statement of facts in the record before it, and thus the court did not have a record of what evidence the state may have presented.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator bank sought a writ to compel respondent court to rescind an order denying its motion for protection of customer bank records. The court denied the writ and held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the discovery of the bank records, and therefore, mandamus was not an appropriate remedy. The statute relating to the disclosure of information concerning borrowers, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 342-705, &sect; 1 (1990), was unclear and there was no clear case law to guide the trial court in the manner in which it should interpret the statute. Thus, there was no clear duty of the trial court to compel protection under the statute. The trial court fashioned an order allowing the discovery, but provided some protection of confidentiality for the bank's customers. The court held that the balancing of interests under an ambiguous statute was a proper exercise of the trial court's discretion, and mandamus was not proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged decision of the 185th District Court, Harris County, (Texas) convicting him of injury to a child. Appellant contended, inter alia, that the prosecution failed to prove the culpable mental state of intentionally or knowingly causing serious bodily injury. Appellant also complained that certain testimony of a physician who treated complainant should not have been admitted and that there was fundamental error in the jury charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal of a decision convicting appellant of injury to a child, the court rejected appellant's contention that the prosecution failed to prove the culpable mental state of intentionally or knowingly causing serious bodily injury. The court held that because the injury to child statute focused on the result of defendant's conduct, the allegation in the indictment that defendant did &quot;intentionally and knowingly engage in conduct that caused serious bodily injury&quot; to a child was sufficient to allege that it was defendant's conscious objective or desire to cause serious bodily injury. The court also rejected arguments that testimony of a physician, who treated the complainant, should not have been admitted. The court held that failure to object to the doctor's qualifications at trial precluded raising the issue on appeal. The court held that, under Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 702 and 704, it was permissible for the doctor to give an opinion on the ultimate issue of whether complainant's injuries were sustained accidentally, or were inflicted intentionally. As to assertions of error in the jury charge, the court held that there was no fundamental error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the trial court convicting appellant of injury to a child was sustained. The appellate court found that the language of the indictment was sufficient to allege the culpable mental state of intentionally or knowingly causing serious bodily injury and that testimony of a physician who treated the complainant was admissible. Any error in the jury charge was not so harmful that appellant was denied a fair and impartial trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected the argument of appellants, convicted of obstructing an abortion clinic passageway, that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.03 was unconstitutionally overbroad and void for vagueness. The statute regulated conduct, not speech, and was not overbroad; the court noted also that appellants cited no authority as to vagueness and, thus, nothing was presented for review. A police videotape of appellants' offenses was properly admitted because the predicate for its admission was established; a &quot;predicate&quot; objection was general and did not preserve error on appeal. When appellants offered a defense upon being denied a directed verdict after the state rested, any error in the denial of their motion was waived. Further, the defenses of necessity and defense of a third person were properly denied, because a fetus was not a legal &quot;person&quot; for purposes of the third person defense and because the harm sought to be prevented was not a legal harm so as to justify necessity. Absent an adverse ruling as to appellants' objection to the prosecutor's jury argument, nothing was preserved for review. Jail sentences falling within the statutory range of punishment were not cruel or unusual.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment convicting appellants of obstructing an abortion clinic passageway was affirmed because the underlying statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad or void for vagueness.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed from an order of dismissal in a forfeiture proceeding commenced under the Texas Controlled Substances Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 5.07(a) (1976). The reviewing court affirmed. The state contended that it was error for the court to treat the 30 day requirement of &sect; 5.07(a) as mandatory rather than directory. The court disagreed. The court determined that the requirement was not an unconstitutional legislative encroachment on prosecutorial discretion under the separation of powers doctrine. The state relied on the fact that several appellate courts had interpreted &sect; 5.07(a) to be merely directory, not mandatory. However, the court failed to see how the state would have been harmed or prejudiced by the requirement that a setting be obtained within the 30 day period. The court found no merit to the state's argument that appellee waived the 30 day setting requirement and was estopped from asserting it. Because the state had not requested or obtained a setting for the forfeiture hearing within the 30 day period, the trial court was correct in dismissing the suit and its judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the ordinance did not violate Tex. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 3a, 19. Appellant sought review. The court agreed that the issues and claims adjudicated by the federal court in appellant's action were the same as those brought to the trial court. The court held that enactment of the zoning ordinance fell within appellee's police power and did not constitute a taking under art. I, &sect; 19. Appellant failed to show that the ordinance discriminated against females solely on the basis of gender in violation of art. I, &sect; 3a. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment because res judicata and collateral estoppel barred appellant's claims, and there was no violation of the Texas Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of appellee city because appellant corporation's claims of the unconstitutionality of appellee's zoning ordinance, that regulated sexually oriented businesses, had been previously litigated in federal court and res judicata and collateral estoppel barred appellant's claims in state court, and the zoning ordinance was a proper exercise of appellee's police power and did not violate the Texas Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At appellant's trial for aggravated sexual assault in violation of Tex. Pen.

After the jury convicted appellant, he sought review and argued that art. 38.071, &sect;&sect; 2, 3 violated his right of confrontation and due process under U.S. Const. amends. VI, XIV and Tex.

The court affirmed appellant's conviction because appellant's admission to the acts alleged in the indictment, together with other untainted testimony, constituted evidence so overwhelming that the introduction of evidence under art. 38.071, &sect;&sect; 2, 3 was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of the decision of the 327th District Court of El Paso County, Texas, that granted appellee's motion to suppress the fruits of a search resulting from an alleged pretext arrest of appellee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of the decision to suppress the fruits of its search of appellee's vehicle after stopping him for a traffic violation. The appellate court reversed, concluding that given the actual occurrence of the stop sign violation, the officers' actions leading to the arrest, search, and seizure were proper, regardless of their preexisting suspicions and desire for an opportunity to stop the appellee's vehicle. Appellee failed to exit the vehicle when an officer approached him, attempted to run the officer over, and took off in his vehicle. Appellee was apprehended, arrested for aggravated assault of a police officer, and his vehicle was searched. Cocaine was found. The officers had observed the vehicle in front of a house known to be a drug house and had wanted to investigate, but did not do so because they did not have probable cause. The court reviewed the origins of the pretext arrest doctrine and concluded that it has been misinterpreted and misapplied in a multitude of other cases. It found that the doctrine, as applied by current courts, was without any authoritative support.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the trial court's decision to suppress evidence found in a search of appellee's vehicle, finding that there was no pretext arrest because appellee had violated a traffic ordinance by failing to stop at a stop sign. As a result of that violation, it was proper for the arresting officers to search his vehicle and seize the contraband that was discovered.</SPAN></P>

The court held that appellant's summary judgment pleadings preserved his contentions that the limitations period provided in art. 4590(i), &sect; 10.01 was unconstitutional as applied to the facts of the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff town's police officer was shot and killed by defendant city's officer during a drug raid. Plaintiffs, executrix and town, filed an action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and the Texas Tort Claims Act for excessive force inflicted in accordance with defendant's policies. The trial court imposed monetary discovery sanctions on defendant, entered default judgment for plaintiffs, and awarded damages for the deceased's pain and suffering and for the family's psychological expenses. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in striking defendant's answers and granting deposition expenses to plaintiffs where defendants willfully failed to produce crucial and complete reports of its officer's psychological tests, its records management, its procedure manuals, and its collection of evidence. The absence of an answer waived limited governmental immunity, admitted liability, and disallowed prejudicial evidence of the deceased's conduct. The court held that trial court properly granted plaintiffs a continuance for good cause, severed attorney fee claims, and admitted a ballistic test involving substantially similar conditions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police set up a roadblock near a high concentration of bars and nightclubs. Every vehicle was stopped and all drivers were asked about their drinking or drug use. Appellee was arrested at the roadblock and charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI). The trial court granted appellee's motion to suppress the evidence obtained in the roadblock. Appellant, the state, filed an appeal. Appellant alleged that the sole purpose of the roadblock was a sobriety check, and that as long as it did not engage in any form of subterfuge in conducting the roadblock, no U.S. Const. amend. IV violation took place. The court affirmed. The court concluded that the roadblock was not based on reasonable suspicion but was designed to be preemptive in nature and premised on nothing more than inarticulable facts; hunches that criminal conduct would occur. As such, the court said, the roadblock was an infringement of individual freedom of privacy and travel. The court said that a DWI roadblock differed from the usual administrative or regulatory inspection because there was no regulatory agency to enforce the drunk driving prohibition other than the police and the criminal courts.</SPAN></P>

Fam. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 17.04(c), 11.11(a)(1) (1986), which included the authority to consent to a blood transfusion for the minor despite his religious conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Harris County Child Protective Service (CPS) filed a complaint under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 11.03(a)(5)-(6) (Supp. 1990) that sought appointment as temporary managing conservator of relator parent's minor child. The court overruled the motion of relators, parent and minor child, that requested leave to file a petition for writ of mandamus to order respondent district court judge not to appoint CPS to give consent to a blood transfusion for the minor. The court held that respondent's order was authorized by Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 17.04(c ), 11.11(a)(1) (1986). Relator parent failed to show any infringement of his right to freely exercise religion in violation of the U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV. Relator parent failed to cite any legal basis to show an infringement of his right to privacy or the right to free exercise of religion. Therefore, respondent did not abuse his discretion in the appointment of CPS. The court ruled that the law on whether relator minor child had legal rights to refuse a blood transfusion was unsettled. Thus, relators did not show that respondent abused his discretion by appointing CPS because the evidence was that a transfusion would occur only if necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the Criminal Court of Harris County (Texas) which convicted her of cruelty to animals under Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of cruelty to animals under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.11(a)(2) for failing to provide the necessary food, shelter, and medical care to sustain the life of a dog in her custody. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in overruling her objection to the state's peremptory challenges, alleging that the state discriminated on the basis of race. Appellant also alleged error in the denial of her motion to quash the information for failure to provide adequate notice of the charges against her. The court affirmed, holding that given the presence of one black person on the jury and the concededly neutral explanation for the peremptory strike of another black venireperson, there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's conclusion that the state did not peremptorily strike a juror solely on the basis of his race. Further, &sect; 42.11(a)(2) sufficiently informed appellant of the nature of the cause against her.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the 185th District Court, Harris County (Texas), that convicted him of aggravated sexual assault. Appellant contended that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, asserted the unconstitutionality of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.021 (1989) as void for vagueness, argued that the evidence was insufficient to convict him, and complained that the charge was fundamentally defective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state charged appellant with aggravated sexual assault, a violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.021 (1989). The court affirmed the judgment that convicted appellant of this offense. The court rejected appellant's contention that he received ineffective assistance of counsel regarding his counsel's failures to object to evidence and to request a jury instruction because appellant's claims were not supported by the record. The court held that because the evidence did not support the medical care defense of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.011(d)(2) (1989), his counsel's failure to request this jury instruction was not ineffective assistance. The court rejected appellant's contention that &sect; 22.021 was unconstitutionally vague because it was not impermissibly vague in all its applications and appellant's proscribed conduct prohibited him from making this complaint. The court determined that &sect; 22.021 was not unconstitutionally vague concerning its penalty because the same act could not also violate &sect; 22.11 and have different results. The court found the direct evidence sufficient to support the conviction because the jury accepted the physician's testimony and not appellant's.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected appellant's contention of ineffective assistance of counsel because it was not supported by the record, determined that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague in all its applications, found that the direct evidence was sufficient for the jury to convict him, and held that there was no fatal variance between the allegation and the proof.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the 174th District Court, Harris County (Texas), which held that his sentence for conviction of aggravated robbery would be cumulated with the sentence imposed in another case, for which he was also convicted of aggravated robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found appellant guilty of aggravated robbery; the jury also assessed punishment at confinement. Before the trial court could pronounce that sentence, the state filed a motion to cumulate it with a sentence rendered in another case, also resulting from an aggravated robbery conviction. Appellant challenged the order, arguing that the record was devoid of any evidence of the prior conviction and sentence. The court found it relevant that both convictions occurred in the same trial court, as a trial court could judicially take notice of its own records in a criminal case, including all judgments and convictions entered by it. As appellee called the trial court's attention to appellant's prior conviction, and because that conviction occurred in that same court, the trial court judicially recognized that fact as true and any proof was unnecessary. The court also noted that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.08(a) (Supp. 1990), which allowed for cumulation of sentences, did not deprive a party of his constitutional right to due process; moreover, the statute had been held to be constitutional. The order below was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order cumulating appellant's sentence for an aggravated robbery conviction with another sentence, also for a prior aggravated robbery conviction occurring in the same trial court, was affirmed. The trial court took judicial notice of the fact of appellant's prior conviction as true, making any proof unnecessary, and the statutory article allowing for such cumulation did not deprive appellant of due process, nor was it unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for resisting arrest after being stopped for a traffic violation and behaving belligerently. She was convicted and ordered to pay a fine. The court affirmed the trial court's conviction. The court held that defendant was not denied a court-appointed lawyer because it had indeed appointed one, just not one who would put forward the arguments she wanted. Because a lawyer had been appointed for defendant, there was no reason to admonish her about the dangers and disadvantages of proceeding pro se as required in Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

There was no error in not giving her an opportunity to object to the amended information because she had been given notice of the amendment, had ample time to respond, and did not do so. There was also no error in not allowing the jury to recommend probation because defendant failed to offer evidence that she was eligible for probation. Defendant's mere filing of her affidavit, as set out in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12 &sect; 4(b) (1990), was not sufficient to establish her eligibility for probation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants mother and grandparents claimed that a jury's verdict which changed custody from appellant mother to appellee father based on allegations of sexual abuse by appellant mother's new husband was reversible error. The court agreed, and in reversing it held that the videotaped testimony of the child was improper because the questioner used leading questions throughout her questioning. The court also held that appellee had elicited improper testimony when he asked witnesses to act as human lie detectors telling jury whether the child was telling the truth. The court held that it was completely improper because the witnesses invaded the province of the jury; only they could determine the truth or veracity of a witness. Additionally, the court held that the trial court erred in admitting expert opinion testimony as to the child's truthfulness. Again the court held that the expert invaded the province of the jury regarding the truthfulness of the child. In conclusion, the court refused to relax the law of evidence to allow hearsay testimony in a case involving allegations of sexual abuse of a child. It reversed holding that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant debtor challenged an order requiring him to endorse one paycheck each month and place it with the court clerk, beginning in August, 1988, to enable appellee company to obtain satisfaction of a judgment against appellant for damages, plus attorneys fees, court costs, and interest. The appellate court affirmed the turnover order because the order was not violative of Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 28 (1983), Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect; 42.002(8) (1984), and Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 63.004 (1986), which exempted current wages for personal services from garnishment or seizure, other than for court-ordered child support payments. The court held further that appellant had not established an abuse of discretion by the trial court. The appellate court stated that once appellant came into possession of the paycheck, it no longer constituted exempt current wages for personal services. Furthermore, the case did not involve a third party in possession of appellant's property or owing money to appellant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed an order of the County Criminal Court at Law No. 6, Harris County (Texas), striking a paragraph in the information that charged defendant with operating a motor vehicle in a public place while intoxicated. The struck paragraph alleged a .10 alcohol concentration using Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 67011-5, &sect; 3(a), (b) (1990) and breath alcohol testing regulations which the trial court found to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state charged defendant with operating a motor vehicle in a public place while intoxicated. Defendant's motion to strike the paragraph of the information that alleged a .10 alcohol concentration, and to suppress intoxilyzer evidence was granted by the trial court finding Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 67011-5, &sect; 3(a), (b) (1990) and Texas Department of Public Safety's Breath Alcohol Testing Regulations unconstitutional. The court reversed the judgment which reinstated the information and remanded the cause. Nothing prohibited an assistant prosecuting attorney from signing a notice of appeal and the defect was cured. Breath alcohol test regulations and statutes were found to be constitutional where they were not unreasonable or arbitrary when enacted. There was no violation of the separation of powers doctrine, due process regarding reasonable terms, vagueness, and unbridled discretion by a scientific director, due process where intoxilyzer evidence's accuracy or reliability was not ensured, due process because multiple breath tests immediately at and after the time of driving were not required, and due process where preservation of a breath specimen was not required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile was adjudicated delinquent for murder and transferred to the penitentiary to finish his 30-year sentence.

The court concluded that appellant could become eligible for parole and did not suffer unequal protection of the laws. The court found that appellant was not criminally prosecuted, because juvenile proceedings are civil proceedings, which are quasi-criminal in nature. The court concluded that the work requirement imposed on appellant was an appropriate punishment and held that the determinate sentencing statute did not impose involuntary servitude or peonage on him in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIII or 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1994 (1981).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the decision of the 174th District Court, Harris County, Texas, which found him guilty of delivering cocaine weighing more than 400 grams and assessed punishment of incarceration and a fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted and sentenced for delivering cocaine weighing more than 400 grams. The court affirmed. The court found that appellant failed to request a jury trial in writing as provided in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 2(b)(2) (1990) and that appellant was informed of the punishment election. As to the evidence of an extraneous offense in appellant's presentence investigation report, the court found that the trial court was presumed to have disregarded this evidence, and appellant failed to object the use of the report. Finally, the court held that Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.112(d)(3) (1990), which governed punishment of offenses for the manufacture or delivery of controlled substances, was rationally related to a legitimate state interest and would not be set aside on equal protection grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for delivering cocaine weighing more than 400 grams because it rejected appellant's argument that the statute governing punishment for this offense was unconstitutional on equal protection grounds. The court further determined that appellant was informed of his punishment election before voir dire when he failed to request a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated robbery and sentenced to 36 years in prison, after assisting two others in robbing a victim of $ 20,000 and killing her spouse.

The court affirmed, finding that the trial court did not improperly instruct the jury on parole law under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a), but only gave a cautionary instruction not to consider how long appellant would be required to serve. Appellant's two statements were given voluntarily, after proper Miranda warnings, and appellant was not under arrest at the time, under either U.S. Const. amend. IV or Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, county appraisal district and county appraisal review board, sought review of a summary granted in favor of appellee company. The trial court found that appellants incorrectly appraised and taxed Conquest for exempt mineral interests owned by the State of Texas, that the error was clerical, and that appellee should have received a refund. The court reversed the judgment. The court found that appellant review board did not err when it approved that portion of appraisal roll affecting appellee as the state did not have a working interest in any of the gas wells in controversy, and appellee was not taxed for any property interest owned by the state. Further, no clerical error existed in the appraisal roll. Appellee received a correct tax bill based upon the appraisal roll determination. Although appellee was taxed for a greater percent working interest that it owned, such error, if any existed, was judicial rather than clerical in nature because appellant district prepared an accurate appraisal and gave appellee timely notice of those values and appellant review board, in good faith, approved the appraisal records when it did not discover any errors contained therein.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the decision of the County Court of Cooke County (Texas), which found her guilty of obstructing a highway in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.03(a)(2)(A). Appellant claimed that the evidence was insufficient to show that she was not a handicapped person, and that her rights to free speech were violated because the statute was overly broad and no overriding public interest was shown by enforcing it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In protest of her treatment by an area bank, appellant put a wheelchair with signage in a lane of traffic in the busiest road in town. After being convicted of obstructing a highway in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42,03(a)(2)(A) she sought review, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to show that she was not entitled to additional protections because of a handicap, and that enforcement of the statute denied her freedom of speech in violation of the state and federal constitutions. The court affirmed her conviction, finding that she did not have a legitimate need for the wheelchair, and that even if she had such a right, she would have no legal privilege to be in the highway obstructing traffic because of that handicap. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to show that appellant created an obstruction by making the passage unreasonably inconvenient and hazardous, and that it was necessary to prevent that conduct. The purpose of the statute was to prevent obstructions in the road, not to inhibit speech, and the restriction on appellant's free speech rights was no greater than was essential to prevent appellant from hurting herself or others.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for obstructing a highway, finding that she did not prove she was entitled to the benefits of a handicapped person, but that even if she were, that did not entitle her to obstruct a roadway. Additionally, her freedom of speech was not violated because preventing harm to appellant and others was an overriding public interest and the statutory restriction was no greater than necessary to prevent that harm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city adopted zoning ordinances which, among other things, required that all private clubs granted a permit by the state of Texas must obtain a specific use permit to operate in the city. The ordinances also required that the operation of such clubs be conducted such that revenues from the sale of food was equal to or greater than the revenue produced through the sale of alcohol. Appellant club owner refused to comply with the ordinances at issue and filed an action which claimed that the ordinances were unconstitutional because they conflicted with state law. The trial court deemed two of the three ordinances at issue unconstitutional and appellant challenged that ruling. Appellee filed a cross-appeal and claimed that none of the ordinances were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed in part and affirmed in part the trial court ruling, and deemed all three ordinances unconstitutional. The court held that the state preempted the regulation of private clubs, and the ordinances at issue attempted to make operating a club more onerous than state statutory requirements. For that reason, the ordinances were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was indicted for the offense of misapplication of fiduciary property over $ 200 in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 32.45. Appellant pled guilty to the offense and was fined and placed on deferred adjudication probation. Later the state petitioned to revoke appellant's probation. The trial court revoked probation and assessed additional punishment. Appellant challenged the decision and claimed that the statute under which he was prosecuted was impermissibly vague, that he should have been charged with general theft, and that he had ineffective assistance of counsel. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court and held that the statute was not impermissibly vague because a person could determine the nature of the offense from the plain meaning of the words used, and that the charge was correct under the circumstances of the case, and that because appellant was unsuccessful in the first two arguments, he could not establish ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and co-defendant made an agreement with undercover agents to purchase cocaine. At the planned meeting site, co-defendant went to approve the cocaine while defendant waited in the car with the money. Defendant and co-defendant were arrested before money changed hands. Defendant was convicted of illegal investment. Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction and that the jury charge was improper. The court affirmed, holding that although the funds did not change hands, the money had been raised and committed by agreement with the agents for the purpose of gaining unlawful possession of the cocaine; therefore, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict. The court held that it was not necessary that the cocaine actually be received as long as defendant believed the funds would further the delivery of the cocaine. Where the trial court instructed the jury that it should find defendant guilty if they found that he committed the charged offense either individually or as a party, the court found the trial court did not err in submitting the law of the parties to the jury in addition to the question of individual culpability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for illegal investment because the evidence of defendant's agreement with the under cover agents and defendant's belief that the money would further the delivery of the cocaine, among other things, was sufficient to support the jury's verdict.

Appellees settled with the company and then applied to the trial court for an order directing payment from the Real Estate Recovery Fund (Fund) because they were unable to collect the remainder of the judgment from appellant. The court held that appellees were not required to attempt recovery of the entire judgment from the co-debtor prior to seeking reimbursement from the Fund and noted that to so hold would enable appellant to evade both payment of the judgment and disciplinary action from the Texas Real Estate Commission. The court found that appellees were entitled to recover attorney fees incurred in applying for reimbursement from the Fund and those incurred in the underlying suit. Noting that the company paid more than half of the total damages awarded, the court held that the company's failure to pay the entire judgment, for which appellant was jointly and severally liable, did not result in an unconstitutional sate subsidy of a private corporation's debt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's magazine shop was under investigation for selling obscene magazines in violation of Tex.

Officers seized magazines, which the officers concluded after inspection were obscene. Appellant was convicted of possession with the intent to promote obscene material, and the court assessed punishment at $ 5000. Appellant challenged the conviction, alleging that the trial court erred when it denied appellant's motion to quash the information because the Texas obscenity law was unconstitutionally overbroad; when it denied his motion to suppress for no probable cause; and, when it failed to give jury instruction regarding purient interest and the average person. The court found that the Texas constitution did not extend freedom to obscene material, that the magazines were seized for preservation of evidence, and that the jury instruction requested was substantially the same as the one given, which caused no harm.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, royalty interest owners and gas companies, sought review of a judgment from the 156th District Court of Live Oak County (Texas), which affirmed appellee commission's order that granted appellee lessee's application to force pool his tracts with those containing appellee royalty interest owners' existing gas well pursuant to the Mineral Interest Pooling Act, Tex. Nat. Res. Code Ann. &sect; 102 et. seq. (1978).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court determined that appellee commission lacked authority to enter an order granting the application to force pool both the main sand and the stray sand because the authority to pool under the Mineral Interest Pooling Act (MIPA), Tex. Nat. Res. Code Ann. &sect; 102 et. seq. (1978), was limited to pooling tracts that were embraced in a reservoir whose deposits, if separated, were in natural communication. The court further held that the granting of a 16 Tex. Admin. Code &sect; 3.10 commingling exception did not alter appellee commission's authority to pool. The court directed that to the extent appellee commission exceeded its authority by pooling two separate reservoirs, the order was to be reformed by vacating the portion pooling the stray sand and affirming the portion that pooled the main sand because substantial evidence showed that the offer was fair and reasonable from the standpoint of the party being force pooled. The court concluded by reversing, in part, the retroactive applicability of the final order as applied to the period between the final field order and the final MIPA order because it interfered with appellants' vested property rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the court affirmed appellee commission's order granting appellee lessee's application to force pool, reforming the order to vacate the portion that pooled the stray sand, the court partially reversed the order to the extent that it applied retroactively to the period between the final field order and the final Mineral Interest Pooling Act order because it interfered with vested property rights.</SPAN></P>

The jury also answered a special issue finding that defendant had used a deadly weapon to commit the offense. The court affirmed in all respects. Defendant claimed that he lacked notice that the state intended to seek a finding on the special issue. The court held that any allegation that averred that a death was caused by a named weapon or instrument necessarily included sufficient notice that the nature of the weapon would be at issue in the trial. The court found that evidence that defendant threatened the victim, retrieved a knife, and then stabbed him was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to conclude that defendant used the knife as a deadly weapon. The court held that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.18, &sect; 8(b)(1) (Supp. 1990) was not unconstitutional because there was nothing unreasonable in a legislative scheme which required persons who use deadly weapons to serve a minimum prison term before being eligible for parole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner sought review of a decision from the 236th District Court of Tarrant County (Texas), which declared a property re-platting consent statute, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 974a, &sect; 5(c)(2) (1987), as constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner proposed to the local planning commission his plan to re-plat his lot of property into three separate lots. At the time, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 974a, &sect; 5(c)(2) (1987), required that the owners of lots within 500 feet of the proposed re-plat be notified. If 20 percent of such owners objected to the proposed re-plat, then written approval of 66 2/3 percent of such owners was required for approval. The commission denied the re-plat because more than 20 percent of the owners objected. Appellant then filed a declaratory judgment action, contending that the consent statute was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. The reviewing court agreed with appellant that the statute delegated the legislative power given by the people to the legislative body, to a narrow segment of the community. The court held that such delegation of authority was contrary to the constitution and reversed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child and sought review, based on his contention that the admission of evidence of sexual assaults on another child at the same time as the victim was prejudicial and that the jury was not properly charged relative to his right not to testify. The court affirmed the verdict and remanded for a new trial on the punishment phase. The court held that appellant had made several voluntary statements which corroborated the complainant's testimony as well as the other child victim's testimony. The court held that the extraneous offenses were relevant and their probative value was not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice. The court further held that failure to include a limiting instruction with regard to the extraneous offenses was not reversible error because the evidence in the case and the confessions were so overwhelming that it would not have effected the outcome. The court did hold that it was error for the trial court not to have instructed the jury regarding appellant's choice not to testify at the punishment stage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his delinquency adjudication by the District Court of Travis County, 126th Judicial District (Texas), for committing murder at age 16. Appellant was sentenced to a determinate sentence of 30 years under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 54.03 and 54.04 (1990), and was transferred to the penitentiary at age 18 to complete his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant committed murder at the age of 16 and a jury found that he engaged in delinquent conduct and committed him to the Texas Youth Commission subject to transfer to the penitentiary for a total of 30 years under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 54.03 and 54.04 (1990). At the age of 18, appellant was transferred to the penitentiary and then challenged his judgment of adjudication and disposition, and the order of transfer. The court affirmed, however, finding that appellant had not been transferred without possibility of parole, because the legislature, under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 498.053(c) (1990), granted parole eligibility to persons transferred from the Texas Youth Commission. Therefore, the court found that appellant's sentence did not violate his equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. The court further found that appellant's sentence did not constitute involuntary servitude under U.S. Const. amend. XIII or the Anti-Peonage Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1994. Finally, the court found that appellant was not improperly prosecuted for a criminal offense because delinquency proceedings are primarily civil in nature.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded for dismissal of the indictments, concluding the charging instruments failed to allege the required mental states. The court rejected appellee's argument that appellant waived the error by not complaining of the defect before the date of trial. The court explained that in order to invoke the jurisdiction of the court, the charging instrument had to allege an offense. The court determined the culpable mental state was an element of the offense that had to be pled. As a result, the court found the lower court never acquired jurisdiction, and a jurisdictional defect was able to be raised at any time. The court further noted in the indictments an essential element was simply absent from the face of the instrument and no words were alleged which could reasonably substitute for such elements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, parents of a deceased employee, brought suit under the Wrongful Death Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 71.003. The trial court granted summary judgment and ruled that appellants' exclusive remedy was a claim against the compensation carrier. The court found that under the Wrongful Death Act, parents of a deceased were designated as beneficiaries entitled to recover. That act, however, limits recovery to actions in which the injured would have been entitled to bring suit if he had lived. In affirming the award of summary judgment, the court ruled that because appellants' son was covered by workers' compensation insurance, he was deemed to have waived his common-law cause of action against his employer. Appellants were therefore precluded from bringing suit because their son would not have been entitled to sue had he lived.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State challenged the order from the 105th District Court of Nueces County, Texas, which dismissed the indictment filed against appellee for &quot;Keeping A Gambling Place&quot; in violation of Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In passing on the vagueness challenge, the court noted that it should not consider hypothetical situations but should scrutinize the statute only to determine whether it was impermissibly vague as applied to appellant. Assuming that appellant acted as alleged in the indictment, the court looked to see if the statute provided appellant with notice so that he could ascertain to what extent his conduct was criminal, and that law enforcement authorities were given sufficient standards to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The court found that under the statute's present form, the state could obtain a conviction of appellee for &quot;Keeping A Gambling Place&quot; on evidence which merely showed that he &quot;received bets&quot; at a certain building. The statute does not require that the receipt of bets at the location constituted bookmaking. As the indictment only alleged that appellant controlled a place that &quot;received bets,&quot; without specifying that he controlled a place where the act of bookmaking occurred, the court found that the trial court did not err in dismissing the indictment. Thus, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order as the statute failed for vagueness in that had not given notice to appellant so that he could ascertain to what extent his conduct was criminal, and had not given law enforcement authorities sufficient standards to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that he was denied equal protection under the state and federal constitutions because the prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges against three of the four black prospective jurors.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants owned interests in tracts of land located within a gas field. Appellee landowner (landowner) held an oil and gas lease on land adjacent to appellants. Appellee commission (commission) granted landowner's application to force pool his tracts with appellants' tracts. The trial court affirmed the commission's order. On appeal, the court held that the commission did not have authority to force pooling of stray sand and main sand as a common reservoir because there was no natural communication. However, the court held that the commission only exceeded its jurisdiction that it pooled both sands in one proceeding. The court also held that landowner met the jurisdiction requirements of Tex. Nat. Res. Code &sect; 102.013 when he filed his application. The court found that appellee made a fair and reasonable offer for voluntary pooling before seeking forced pooling. Appellee also demonstrated standing by showing that pooling would prevent the drilling of an unnecessary well. The court also modified the order to the extent that retroactive application affected appellants' property rights and was unconstitutional. Judgment was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and partially vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's misdemeanor conviction was upgraded to felony theft by two prior thefts pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03(e)(4)(C). Appellant was sentenced to the minimum for a habitual criminal, 25 years. On appeal, appellant argued that the enhancement statute was unconstitutional; that his punishment was improperly enhanced under the repeat and habitual felony statute; and that his punishment was cruel and excessive. The court held that the challenged statute, which provided for the enhancement of theft offenses was not unconstitutional in general and was particularly not unconstitutional as to appellant. His argument was purely theoretical and did not reflect his situation. The court further held that, even if appellant had been pardoned on the prior felony conviction, it would still be available for enhancement purposes. On appellant's cruel and unusual punishment claim, the court held that under the habitual criminal statute, appellant's 25 year sentence was the minimum punishment allowed and that Texas courts have consistently held that punishment assessed by a judge or jury within the statutory limit was not cruel or unusual.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the motion, finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was tried and convicted for aggravated sexual assault in violation of Tex. Penal Code. Ann. &sect; 22.021 (1989). The indictment as originally presented included two enhancement allegations. Before trial, the state moved to substitute one felony conviction for another. Appellant did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence pertaining to the offense for which he was tried. Rather, he asserted that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 28.10 (1989) was unconstitutional because it allowed an indictment to be amended without further presentation to the grand jury. The court affirmed the conviction and noted that the requirement that amendment of indictments be presented to the grand jury dealt with the substantive offense for which appellant was being accused. The amendment of an indictment that was related to enhancement allegations had nothing to do with the substance of the original indictment and did not charge appellant with an additional or different offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed a decision of the County Court at Law No. 5 for Travis County (Texas) that suppressed evidence of appellee accused's blood-alcohol test results. The state contended that the results were admissible because appellee had consented to the search and also because no state agent had conducted the search.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state charged appellee accused with driving while intoxicated in violation of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. &sect; 67011-1 (1990). The arrest grew out of an accident that occurred while appellee was returning from a party. The accident was not appellee's fault. While at the hospital, medical personnel ordered a blood sample to assist in diagnosis and treatment of appellee's injuries. The state requested and obtained a portion of this sample for analysis. Neither the state nor the medical personnel had noted any signs of intoxication by appellee prior to the test. The trial court suppressed the blood test results. The court affirmed and noted that appellee had not consented to the search by the state and there was no warrant obtained by the search. Thus, the state had to prove that the search was justified by an exception to the warrant requirement. The court found that appellee's simple acquiescence to a claim of lawful authority was not sufficient to establish an exception to the warrant requirement. The court also noted that the seizure of the blood sample by the police officer from the nurse constituted state involvement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's suppression of the results form appellee's blood alcohol test, taken after appellee was in an accident, because the search was per se unreasonable where the state conducted the search without a warrant. The court also rejected the state's arguments that the search was a private search and was therefore not subject to the warrant requirement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Appellant contended that the election statute, which criminalized his contribution, was unconstitutionally vague and that he was unaware that his actions were against the law. Appellant further contended that Texas legislative history indicated an intent to remove criminal penalties for the making of political contributions. The court stated that the election statute clearly criminalized the making of a political contribution such as appellant's and that although the statute was inartfully worded, the legislative intent was clear and its directive was to be upheld. The court found no merit to appellant's contention that he was unaware of the election statute prior to his violation because the evidence showed that appellant was an attorney, a frequent political contributor, and a former political candidate. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that convicted appellant of making an illegal campaign contribution.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that appellant waived any possible error as to the denial of his motion for instructed verdict of acquittal by presenting evidence in his defense after his motion was denied. The court also found that appellant's conviction did not implicate his free speech rights under U.S. Const. amend. I and Tex. Const. art.

The court also found that appellant's uncontrolled outburst after being escorted to the club's office to await the police was admissible as a spontaneous and voluntary oral outburst that did not result from interrogation or a response to a police inquiry. The court additionally held that appellant failed to preserve the issue of the trial court's denial of his oral motion to quash the information against him because all motions to set aside an information had to be in writing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pipeline company sought review of a judgment by the 333rd District Court, Harris County, Texas, which awarded appellee trading company damages and prejudgment interest in its action against appellant for negligence and breach of contract after it mis-delivered crude oil to a nominee other than the one to whom appellee had contracted to sell the oil.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reformed the judgment against appellant pipeline company, for negligently delivering oil to a company different from the one to which appellee trading company had sold it, to account for appellee's recovery from the receiving entity and affirmed it as reformed. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission did not have exclusive or primary jurisdiction over the case and appellant did not rebut the presumption that the trial court had jurisdiction. The parties had an enforceable contract and appellant's failure to discover the mismatch of nominations breached appellant's duty to appellee. There was sufficient evidence to support the findings that appellant's breach of contractual and common-law duties was the proximate cause of appellee's damage and to support the trial court's apportionment of fault. Appellant failed to present the trial court with controverting evidence of market prices and thus could not show that the trial court used an erroneous measure in calculating the market value of the oil. The trial court properly assessed 10 percent prejudgment interest because the case involved both tort and contract issues and because the damages were not ascertainable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reformed the judgment to account for appellee trading company's pre-trial recovery from the receiving nominee and affirmed the judgment as reformed. Appellant pipeline company was negligent and also breached its contract with appellee when it mis-delivered oil to the wrong nominee. The trial court properly exercised jurisdiction over the case and properly based the prejudgment interest calculation on contract and tort grounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by information in a county criminal court at law for unlawfully carrying a weapon under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 46.02 (1974). Defendant filed in the district court a writ of habeas corpus. The district court denied defendant's relief. Upon appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 11.05 (1965), the district court had power and jurisdiction to issue defendant's writ of habeas corpus even though defendant was charged by information in the county criminal court. The court found that Tex. Penal Code &sect; 46.02 (1974) was not unconstitutional because the statute did not impinge upon a person's right to keep and bear arms under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. The court reasoned that a person only had the right to keep and bear arms if there was evidence that the possession of weapons had some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia. The court held that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 46.02 was not unconstitutionally vague where the statute set a standard that was sufficiently clear and definite so that an ordinary person would know the proscribed conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged her jury conviction in the County Criminal Court, Dallas County, Texas, for the offense of failure to leave information following an automobile collision under Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for the offense of failure to leave information following an automobile collision under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701d, &sect; 39 (1964). The court found that the applicable statutes gave sufficient notice of what conduct was required because Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701d, &sect;&sect; 39 and 40 (1964) read in conjunction with Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. arts. 6675a-2 and 6675a-3e, made it sufficiently clear that the term vehicle registration number as used in &sect; 40 meant license plate number. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support her conviction and show that she knowingly failed to provide the required information after the accident, and that it was not the complainant's duty to obtain the information. Proof of noncompliance with any one of the five &sect; 40 requirements constituted an offense under &sect; 39 and it was unnecessary for the trial court to charge her on all requirements. Failure to give her name, address, and vehicle registration number were three separate means of committing an offense under &sect;&sect; 39 and 40 and therefore it was proper for the trial court to charge only on the two means supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for failure to leave information following an automobile collision because the statutes gave ample notice of the required conduct, the evidence was sufficient to convict her, the violation of each component of the statute could be charged separately, and the controlling statute could be violated by failing to do any one of the three distinct required actions addressed therein.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A municipal court (Texas), convicted appellants of having operated an adult arcade without a permit.

On appeal, the County Criminal Courts, Harris County (Texas), affirmed the convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were convicted of having operated an adult arcade without a permit. Upon their pleas of nolo contendere, the court found them guilty. On appeal, the convictions were affirmed. Appellants asserted that Houston, Tex., Code 85-1337 (&quot;the ordinance&quot;) violated U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV in that it was void for vagueness, overbroad, and was an impermissible prior restraint on free speech. The court had recently rejected these contentions, and similar provisions in a California ordinance had been upheld as constitutional. Appellants also asserted that the ordinance was void under Tex. Const. art. 11 &sect; 5, and under the doctrine of preemption, because of its inconsistency with Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 8814, 8817, and 2372w (1989). Under Tex. Const. art. 11, &sect; 5, city charters may not have contained provisions inconsistent with the state constitution or with the general laws passed by the state legislature. The statutes dealt with the regulation of coin-operated machines, and the regulation of the locations of sexually oriented commercial activities. As the court had already held that the ordinance was not inconsistent with these statutes, the ordinance was not void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed, and appellants' points of error were overruled. Houston City Code had not violated the First or the Fourteenth amendments, and it was, therefore, not void for vagueness, overbreadth, or as an impermissible prior restraint on free speech. The ordinance was void under the doctrine of preemption, as its provisions were not inconsistent with the state constitution or with general laws passed by the state legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee county judge was the budget officer and the presiding officer over the commissioner's court. Indictments were returned against appellee for alleged coercive influence over public servants when appellee threatened to terminate funding of the salaries of two county officials in an attempt to coerce them into action within the scope of their duties. The court held that the trial court acted correctly when it quashed and dismissed the indictments. The court held that appellee's indictments under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 36.03(a)(1) and Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 36.01(1) (F), which were handed down before the statutes were amended effective September 1, 1989, violated appellee's rights under U.S. Const. amend. I (the First Amendment). The court held that threats that portended lawful action were afforded First Amendment protection and the application of section 36.01(1)(F) to appellee's alleged conduct was unconstitutionally vague because of the definition of &quot;coercion.&quot; The court held that appellee did not have fair notice of what type of threat was prohibited, and there was not a clear objective standard so that those charged with enforcement could assess conduct for legality.</SPAN></P>

The trial court set aside the information on the ground that the statute creating the offense was unconstitutionally vague in violation of U.S. Const. amend. V, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. The state filed a notice of appeal under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.01(a)(1) (1989).

The court reversed the order setting aside the information, holding that the term intoxication in &sect; 105.01(5) was not unconstitutionally vague and was sufficient to afford defendant notice of the proscribed conduct, and the court remanded the case for reinstatement of the information.</SPAN></P>

Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 21.01 et seq. (1986) for failure to pay child support. Defendant was indicted for criminal nonsupport and put into custody in Texas after extradition from Michigan. Defendant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus was denied, and he appealed, claiming a lack of jurisdiction and claiming Tex. Penal Code &sect; 25.05(g)(2) was unconstitutional. The appellate court affirmed. The statutory criminal nonsupport conduct had the necessary consequence, detrimental effect, and result of denying a child who was a Texas resident the support to which he was entitled to receive by a court order. The interest in protecting the viability of a child support judgment and the rights of Texas residents to have received court awarded support gave Texas jurisdiction. Moreover, extradition was proper, and the indictment sufficiently alleged all the elements of &sect; 25.05(g)(2) to support personal jurisdiction. Section 25.05(g)(2) was not unconstitutional as applied to nonresidents under equal protection or cruel and unusual punishment analysis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of criminal trespass of a habitation under Texas Penal Code Ann. &sect; 30.05 (1989) in that he entered the habitation with notice that entry was forbidden and remained without effective consent. On appeal, defendant argued that the statutory term &quot;remain&quot; rendered the criminal trespass statute void for vagueness because the statute did not specify how long one must &quot;remain&quot; to be subjected to criminal prosecution. The court applied rules of statutory construction, including Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 311.011(a) which required that the challenged term be construed according to common usage, and affirmed. The court held that the dictionary definition of &quot;remain&quot; made no reference to a time requirement; consequently, because a stay of any length of time after entry would satisfy the statutory &quot;remain&quot; requirement, the wording of the statute was sufficient in describing the conduct which it declared to be criminal. The court also held that given the wording of the criminal trespass statute, the state could present evidence of either or both &quot;enter or remain;&quot; and thus, even if &quot;remain&quot; was vague, proof of &quot;entry&quot; would suffice to sustain defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for criminal trespass because the statutory term &quot;remain&quot; was not so indefinite as to render the criminal trespass statute void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant committed two sexual incidents on his granddaughter. In one incident, he exposed himself and touched her genitals and penetrated her with his genitals, while in the other incident he exposed himself and asked her to place her hand on his penis. Two days later, he admitted his transgressions to an aunt of the granddaughter. Appellant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault and child indecency. Appellant claimed that error occurred when the trial court allowed testimony about other incidents of sexual abuse both at the guilt/innocence stage and at the punishment stage. He also complained that the case should have been dismissed because the statute was unconstitutional and, additionally, he was denied due process of law. The court reviewed the record and found no error as to any of the claims made by appellant. The court noted that the extraneous offense issue was not meritorious because of an exception in cases pertaining to young children. The court also noted that there was no violation of appellant's equal protection rights or his due process rights.</SPAN></P>
