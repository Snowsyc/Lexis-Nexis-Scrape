He refused to follow the agency's executive director's orders and as a result, the director recommended to the agency's board that the employee be terminated from his position. A hearing was held and the board terminated the employee's employment. The employee filed an administrative appeal with the lower court, which was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court affirmed finding that there was no subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal because the appeal had not been taken from a decision in a contested case under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-166(2). The court found that the agency was not statutorily required to determine the employee's legal right or privilege to his continued employment. Moreover, the employee held an appointed position that was served at the &quot;pleasure of&quot; the executive director. This further supported the finding that the agency was not required to do more than give the employee a termination hearing. Thus, the court found that &sect; 4-166(2) limited contested case status to those proceedings where agencies were required to determine a party's legal rights or privileges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed a motion requesting the court to review of an order entered in the appellate court (Connecticut), which granted the State's motion to strike certain portions of defendant's brief filed in defendant's appeal from his conviction for robbery in the first degree and larceny in the first degree after a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During jury voir dire, defendant moved to dismiss a panel on the ground that the absence from the panel of minority residents was evidence that the panel had not been randomly selected. The trial court denied the motion and the jury convicted defendant, an African-American, of first degree robbery and first degree larceny. On appeal, the appellate court granted the State's motion to strike the issue of lack of random selection of the jury panel from defendant's brief and appendix. Noting that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-197f limited the court's subject matter jurisdiction to final judgments of the appellate court, the court dismissed defendant's motion for review of the order because the appellate court's action in striking the issue was not a final judgment. The court further ruled that it had discretion to transfer the case to its own docket under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-199(c) but declined to exercise that discretion. The court determined that, given the current state of the record, it preferred to await the ultimate outcome of the appellate court's appeal before considering whether to review defendant's claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant owner entered into a contract with plaintiff contractor pursuant to which plaintiff agreed to construct condominium units and commercial space on defendant's property. When the owner ordered the contractor to stop working, the contractor filed a certificate of mechanic's lien to secure its claim. The contractor served a copy of the certificate on the owner, but did not serve a copy on defendant bank, an encumbrancer of the property. The trial court concluded that the mechanic's lien was invalid because the bank, as a mortgagee of the property, was an &quot;owner&quot; within the meaning of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-34 and was thereby entitled to notice of the filing of the lien. The appellate court first held that the contractor was not required to give notice to all encumbrancers. The court affirmed the trial court, however, and found that the lien was invalid because no oral oath was administered, the contractor's president did not sign a statement swearing to the truth of the facts contained in the certificate, and no ceremony was performed as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-22.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 53a-135, and, following a plea of nolo contendere, of being a persistent dangerous felony offender in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-40(a). On review, defendant claimed that the trial court improperly failed to notify him of the contents of the second part of the substitute information charging him as a persistent dangerous felony offender. The court found no merit in this contention because defendant, having had actual notice of the contents of the second part of the information, did not contest the persistent dangerous felony offender charge. Instead, he pleaded nolo contendere to it. Defendant also claimed that the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury that, in order to find robbery in the second degree to have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, it had to agree unanimously on one of the aggravating factors that distinguished robbery in the second degree from robbery in the third degree. The court found no violation of defendant's rights because none of the jury instructions expressly sanctioned a non-unanimous verdict. Accordingly, the convictions were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 17-245, which required a trial judge to follow the presentence report of the Whiting Forensic Institute advising against commitment of a convicted defendant to the institute. In determining the merits of defendant's challenge, the court first noted that statutory language did preclude the trial court from ordering the commitment of defendant contrary to the Institute's recommendation. However, such preclusion did not violate the separation of powers doctrine; the judiciary did not have exclusive authority over the sentencing of criminal defendants; and the delegation of sentencing authority to the Institute contained reasonably definite standards. Because defendant had no liberty interest derived from the due process clause in obtaining treatment at the Institute instead of being incarcerated, his due process claim was meritless. In addition, because he was a member of the advantaged class, he lacked standing to challenge, on equal protection grounds, the constitutionality of the statute with regards to its differing treatment of convicted but unsentenced defendants, civilians, and sentenced defendants.</SPAN></P>

The trial court, on appeal of the first actions, determined that neither the denial of the variance application nor the denial of the amendment application resulted in an unconstitutional taking. Accordingly, the trial court granted the zoning authorities' summary judgment motion in the inverse condemnation action and concluded that the owner's claim was precluded because it had been fully and fairly litigated in the prior appeal. The court affirmed the judgment but did so on the grounds of issue, not claim, preclusion. The court reasoned that the trial court's ruling on the taking issues was necessary and essential to the prior judgment because, if the trial court had found that an unconstitutional taking had occurred, it would have been required to sustain the appeals, whether or not the zoning authorities' actions were supported by evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant executed a waiver of his Miranda rights in Spanish so that the police could interrogate him regarding a murder. Although a translator was present at the interrogation, defendant did not use his services. At trial, defendant did not use the services of the translator either. Defendant claimed that he was entitled to a word by word translation of the interrogation, he did not sufficiently understand the interrogation because it was in English, and he was unduly coerced at the interrogation because it was in English. The court held that the convictions were proper because defendant spoke and understood English. The court noted that defendant's failure to use the translators at the interrogation and at trial indicated that he had a sufficient command of English to understand the interrogation and the trial. Also, defendant stated in Spanish at the end of the interrogation that he understood what happened at the interrogation. There was no abuse of discretion in allowing a fellow jail inmate to testify against defendant after the State and defendant rested, especially where defendant did not ask for a continuance to question the witness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff injured person filed an application for a prejudgment remedy in conjunction with the personal injury action that she filed against defendant driver. The Superior Court in the Judicial District of Stamford-Norwalk (Connecticut) denied her application as a matter of law. Thereafter, she filed a motion to open the order. The trial court denied the motion, and she filed a complaint with the appellate court. The court transferred her appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">To secure her right to collect a possible judgment, the injured person sought, in accordance with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-278d, to establish probable cause to sustain the validity of her claim. The trial court ruled that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 52-278c, 52-278d were facially unenforceable. On appeal, the court reversed and noted that there was a strong presumption of constitutionality. In the absence of weighty countervailing circumstances, the trial court's invalidation of the legislation was improvident. The court construed the legislative intent and concluded that the provisions for a prejudgment remedy found in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 52-278c and 52-278d were not unconstitutionally vague on their face. Because the driver was afforded the opportunity, in an adversarial hearing, to contest the validity of the claims made in support of the application, a prejudgment attachment could have constitutionally been issued without a showing of exigent circumstances. When there was no ex parte impairment of the driver's property rights, a judicial finding of probable cause sufficed to satisfy his constitutional right to due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, which denied the injured person's application for prejudgment interest as a matter of law. The court remanded the personal injury action for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner entered a plea of guilty to murder and subsequently petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel. After his unsuccessful writ, the petitioner sought another writ of habeas corpus challenging the effectiveness of his appointed counsel in his first proceeding for writ of habeas corpus. The petition was denied, but the appellate court reversed and held that he could seek the writ on the grounds of ineffective assistance of habeas counsel. The warden appealed and the court affirmed the appellate court's decision. The court reasoned that the right to effective assistance of counsel is inherent in the right to appointed counsel for an indigent petitioner in a habeas action. The court held that nonconstitutional claims could be raised in habeas proceedings as well as constitutional issues. And finally, the court held that release from incarceration was not required to be the immediate relief achievable from a habeas petition and that the grant of a new trial would be the appropriate relief. Thus, the court held that a writ of habeas was permissible on the ground that an attorney at a prior habeas corpus proceeding was ineffective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent mother sought review of the judgment from the Appellate Court, which affirmed the trial court's judgment terminating her parental rights pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 45a-717(f)(2) &amp; (f)(3), arising from mother's use of cocaine in the hours before giving birth to the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the mother, a cocaine user, gave birth to her child, the commissioner of children and youth services obtained temporary care and custody of the child due to the mother's alleged cocaine use within hours of beginning labor and petitioned for termination of parental rights. The trial court terminated the mother's parental rights. The appellate court affirmed. The state supreme court reversed. The court first found that the trial court's factual finding that the mother injected cocaine after beginning labor was not supported by the evidence. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45a-717(f)(2) was to be construed narrowly, in a way that minimizes state interference. The court held that &sect; 45a-717(f)(2) did not permit termination of parental rights based on prenatal conduct of the mother. The court's reading of the statute required that only the conduct of a parent of a child already born could be considered. The court also held that the actions of the state in taking the child away from the mother effectively prevented the development of an ongoing parent-child relationship, the absence of which constituted grounds for termination under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45a-717(f)(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgments of the lower courts terminating the mother's parental rights. The court held that the statute authorizing termination for a parent's conduct could not justify termination for conduct committed before the child was born and that the statute permitting termination for failure to develop an ongoing parent-child relationship could not justify termination when the relationship was frustrated by the state's actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an undercover operation, defendant helped a co-defendant sell a packet of heroin to an officer. While admitting he was at the scene, defendant claimed he was a mere bystander, and neither knew what was occurring nor participated in the crime. He claimed that due process was violated by asking him at trial about his failure to tell his attorney and authorities that a third party had allegedly dropped a brown bag containing vials of crack cocaine. While comment on defendant's post-arrest silence was barred, the alleged violation was harmless error. The court rejected defendant's next claim that it was an abuse of discretion to allow merely cumulative rebuttal testimony. The record failed to support his claim that the trial court's jury instructions unfairly marshaled evidence for the State while ignoring evidence favorable to defendant, thus depriving him of a fair trial. Any error in refusing to allow a defense witness to remove handcuffs before testifying was determined to have been harmless. Finally, the court rejected a claim that a mistrial was in order due to the prosecutor's references in closing argument to the absence of two defense witnesses, as any error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the trial court improperly denied his motions during jury selection to excuse certain venirepersons for cause. The court reversed the convictions and ordered a new trial. The trial court erred in failing to excuse a prospective juror for cause where the juror lived in the neighborhood in which the murder took place and she stated that she would be in an awkward position if she found defendant not guilty. It was reversible error for the trial court to force defendant to use peremptory challenges on persons who should have been excused for cause where defendant subsequently exhausted all of his peremptory challenges and an additional challenge was sought and denied. The trial court's action abridged defendant's right to exercise peremptory challenges in the selection of his jury under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. On retrial, a question regarding defendant's initial failure to tell police where he was on the night the crimes were committed was not allowable unless its context clearly indicated that it referred only to defendant's prearrest silence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The jury could reasonably have found that defendant sexually assaulted a cellmate. Defendant did not testify at trial but presented evidence tending to discredit the complainant's testimony. The court found that a new trial was required because the trial court improperly restricted defense counsel from commenting on certain facts that had been elicited from the complainant on cross-examination, thereby violating defendant's right to the effective assistance of counsel. The trial court improperly assumed that defendant was required to present specific evidence of an agreement between the State and the complainant or of the complainant's belief that he had received lenient treatment on his criminal charges in exchange for his testimony. However, in order to argue the question of the complainant's motivation, defendant needed to establish only a reasonable inference that the complainant could have believed that there was a causal connection between his testimony and the disposition of the criminal charges against him. While the prosecutor's comment regarding defendant's failure to testify appeared to be improper, the court declined to decide whether it would have required a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff mortgagee appealed a supplemental judgment of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain at New Britain (Connecticut) that confirmed a sale and appealed the denial of its motion for a deficiency judgment. The mortgagee contended that the 30-day limit in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-14(a) for deficiency judgment motions in mortgage foreclosure cases did not apply to judgments of foreclosure by sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mortgagor granted a mortgage to the mortgagee on land to secure a promissory note. The mortgagor defaulted on the note. The mortgagee filed a foreclosure action against the mortgagor in the trial court. That court granted the mortgagee's motion for judgment of strict foreclosure. It then opened the judgment of strict foreclosure and granted the motion of a bank, a subsequent lienholder, for judgment of foreclosure by sale. It then executed and ratified a judicial sale of the property, and rendered the supplemental judgment confirming the sale. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case. Section 49-14(a) was not applicable to judgments of foreclosure by sale given that the language of &sect; 49-14(a) indicated that even though an evidentiary hearing was needed to calculate the value of the mortgaged real property, and consequently the total of any deficiency after a strict foreclosure, this calculation would be unnecessary after any foreclosure by sale. As a result, the 30-day limit had to be interpreted as applying only to strict foreclosures. The mortgagor did not raise the defense of laches as to any delay by the mortgagee in filing the deficiency judgment motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the action against the mortgagor, the court reversed the supplemental judgment that confirmed the sale, and reversed the denial of the mortgagee's motion for a deficiency judgment. The court remanded the action with instructions to rule on mortgagee's deficiency judgment motion.</SPAN></P>

The primary issue before the court was whether the magistrate's contempt power under the Family Support Magistrate's Act, Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father was found in contempt and was incarcerated by the family magistrate for failing to pay child support. On his release, the father challenged the constitutionality of that act, arguing that contempt was a power exclusive to judges and could not be given to non-judges by the legislature. On review the court held that the father's release did not make the appeal moot in part because the issue was very important and because the father could well be confronted with the same problem in the future. The court held that the legislative creation of courts or administrative bodies of inferior, limited, or special jurisdiction was lawful and included transferring from the superior court the power to impose sanctions for contempt of court. The court also held that contempt was not an exclusively judicial power, citing various administrative, executive, and legislative bodies that had both quasi-judicial functions and the power of contempt. The court held that the legislature had the authority to order the restraint of anyone if it was necessary for the enforcement of the law; the test was the degree to which it granted that power and whether appellate judicial review was possible.</SPAN></P>

The landowners appealed, contending that the policy reasons underlying Doolittle v.

On appeal, the court held that procedural safeguards eroded many of the concerns upon which the Doolittle rule was predicated and that the Commission and the developer had submitted to the jurisdiction of the trial court by failing to file a timely motion to dismiss the administrative appeal in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction and eventually, the United States Supreme Court remanded to the state appellate court, which ordered a new trial. The state sought review. The court affirmed, holding that although under federal exclusionary rule, the evidence obtained outside the home would be admissible, the Connecticut constitution afforded greater protection than did the U.S. Constitution against unlawful searches and seizures. The court held that the evidence obtained both inside and outside the home was inadmissible under the state constitution because the warrantless entry into defendant's home was unlawful.

The court also concluded that the developer did not meet its burden of proving that the conditions of the special permit regulations did not contain known and fixed standards for the regulation of such applications. Any application to revise the site plan was to have been evaluated in light of the conditions set out in the special permit regulations.

In addition, the inmate did not seek permission for an extension of the time limit. As a result, the trial court denied the inmate's petition for certification to appeal. The inmate argued that the trial court had discretion to accept an untimely petition. Affirming the judgment, the court ruled that the trial court correctly concluded that it had no discretion to accept the inmate's petition for certification to appeal after the 10-day time period under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-470(b). The court found the statute to be unambiguous. Even if the statute's meaning were not clear, however, the court determined that the statute's legislative history revealed an intent to remedy a perceived problem of too many frivolous appeals of denied habeas petitions. Thus, the statute's legislative history was consistent with the court's ruling that the trial court lacked discretion under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-470(b).</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The court held that the facts alleged did not demonstrate an interference with the trustee's property that in a substantial degree abridged or destroyed the value of the property or the trustee's use and enjoyment of it. The court held that although the trustee's allegations could conceivably support a claim of nuisance or some other sort of tortious interference by the state with the trustee's use of his property, they did not amount to a taking of the trustee's property in the constitutional sense. The court further held that an individual who complained of tortious interference by the State that was not so serious as to constitute a constitutional taking of his private property was not without recourse through other avenues of relief.</SPAN></P>

Defendant cross-examined the state's witnesses as to certain evidence, which was not maliciously lost. Moreover, accomplice testimony and tangible evidence were relevant, and admissible evidence showing that the victim was dead, and died as a result of defendant's actions. Thus, defendant was not denied a fair trial or due process. The jury was properly charged on the biases of the accomplice witnesses, and any error was not plain. Defendant was not prejudiced by the expansion of the information. Nor was he prejudiced by the state's comments, which did not improperly address defendant's failure to testify or his right to silence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizens and electors of the state challenged the decennial reapportionment of respondent reapportionment commission. The court noted that once a duly appointed reapportionment commission published a redistricting plan, Conn. Const. art. III, &sect; 6(c) prescribed that the redistricting plan had the full force of law. Thus, the court's review of the validity of the plan, like any other judicial review, was limited to an inquiry into the plan's compliance with applicable state and federal constitutional mandates. This review invoked the court's judicial authority, but did not warrant the court's exercise of legislative power. Thus, the court refused the citizens' request that the court correct alleged errors in the plan. The court stated that its judicial reluctance to become too deeply involved in reapportionment disputes was not confined to prudential concerns about entering the political thicket. It also stemmed from the inherent unsuitability of such disputes to the ordinary and traditional principles of adjudication. The court found that the citizens and electors had failed to meet their burden of showing a constitutional violation of the town integrity principle.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought to withdraw his plea of nolo contendere, claiming that the plea was not made knowingly because, at the time that his plea was entered, the trial court did not inform him that if he went to trial he would have the privilege against self-incrimination. The court held that the federal constitution required only that a defendant, at the time of the entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, be informed by the trial court that, in conformity with his right against self-incrimination, he could not be compelled to enter that plea. The federal constitution mandated only that a defendant be apprised of the fact that he did not have to enter a plea of guilty or nolo contendere and thus incriminate himself. The trial court's canvass, prior to the acceptance of defendant's plea, adequately informed him that he possessed a right against self-incrimination that guaranteed that he need not incriminate himself by entering a plea of nolo contendere. Therefore, defendant failed to establish a constitutional violation clearly existed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested after obtaining a gram of cocaine in exchange for an undercover narcotics officer's money. At trial, the jury heard evidence that defendant was drug-dependent at the time of the arrest, as defined by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-240(18), (19). On cross-examination of those witnesses, the state elicited some evidence that she was not. The appellate court reversed defendant's conviction on the ground that the state failed to disprove drug dependence beyond a reasonable doubt. The state could not prove the absence of drug dependence by an impermissible inference of the opposite of the testimony of defense witnesses. However, the absence of drug dependency was not an element of the crime of sale of cocaine by a person who was not drug-dependent under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-278(b). The burden of proving this exemption from liability was on defendant, by a preponderance of the evidence, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a278(b). Because defendant reasonably believed that she needed only to raise the issue at trial, defendant was entitled to a new trial of the charge at which she could attempt to prove her drug dependence.</SPAN></P>

However, the court agreed with defendant that he could not be convicted of both conspiracy to commit robbery and conspiracy to commit burglary. The court held that whether the object of a single agreement was to commit one or many crimes, it was in either case that agreement which constituted the conspiracy which the statute punished. The one agreement could not be taken to be several agreements or several conspiracies because it envisaged the violation of several statutes rather than one. The single agreement was the prohibited conspiracy and, however diverse its objects, it violated but a single statute. For such a violation, only the single penalty prescribed by the statute could be imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The free publication contained weekly television listings and entertainment articles but it did not include general news items.

Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-411(1), which imposed the use tax; (b) the publications did not qualify as &quot;newspapers&quot; under Conn. Gen.

Plaintiffs argued in part that their publication was a &quot;newspaper&quot; entitled to an exemption from the use tax. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. In so ruling, the court examined the format of the publications and concluded that they did not fit within the common understanding of what one would envision as a newspaper, and therefore, that it was not eligible for the exemption in &sect; 12-412(f). The court also ruled that the use tax was rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.</SPAN></P>

The court first concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support the finding that defendant conspired to commit murder.

The State's proof indicated an informal agreement to cause the victim's death, that defendant intended to cause the death at the time of the agreement, and that defendant committed an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy, satisfying the elements of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-48. The court then held that the warrantless seizure of evidence from defendant's wallet was properly admissible under U.S. Const. amend. IV because the search was conducted incident to a lawful arrest. The court also rejected defendant's claims that an oral waiver of Miranda rights was insufficient and that the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury on defendant's theory of self-defense.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford (Connecticut), which convicted him for first degree kidnapping pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-92(a)(2)(B), first degree sexual assault pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-70(a), and other crimes. Defendant argued unconstitutional jury selection, improper jury instructions, and improper exclusion of evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After jurors were selected, the trial court called a second panel to choose alternates. Defendant moved for a new panel, arguing that neither panel represented a fair cross-section. The trial court denied the motion as untimely. Later, defendant again unsuccessfully objected to the panel, and informed the trial court that the clerk was dismissing jurors for economic hardship if their employers would not pay the difference between their jury pay and their normal wages. After trial, defendant again raised the objection in his motion for a new trial, which the trial court denied. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that defendant failed to make a prima facie case of unconstitutional jury selection because he did not offer any evidence that a &quot;distinctive group&quot; was excluded from the panels, or that unconstitutional criteria involving a suspect class was used in selecting the panels. Further, the trial court properly charged the jury about the victim's ability to observe defendant, and that defendant's consciousness of his guilt could be inferred from the fact that, before police told him that the victim had been punched, defendant told police he did not cut his hand hitting a girl.</SPAN></P>

The victim died and defendant was convicted of felony murder. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court determined that the State was entitled to a jury instruction on accessorial liability. Defendant could be convicted as an accessory even though he was charged only as a principal because the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to establish accessorial conduct and defendant was specifically put on notice by the trial court, prior to beginning his defense, that the issue of accessorial liability was still in the case. The exposure of two jurors to a televised interview of the victim's mother was not prejudicial because their exposure was extremely limited, neither juror discussed the program with his fellow jurors, the trial court personally viewed the videotape and concluded that its only effect was to possibly evoke some sympathy. The trial court limited defendant's cross-examination of a witness because the trial court was not satisfied that the prior statements were inconsistent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with sexual assault in the first degree, burglary in the second degree, and sexual assault in the third degree. He entered pleas of guilty to the first two counts and an Alford plea to the third count. Defendant and the prosecutor agreed that the State would recommend a sentence of 20 years but that defendant retained the right to argue for a lesser sentence. Defendant argued for a 10 year sentence, but the trial court imposed a term of 20 years on the sexual assault in the first degree and two concurrent 5 year sentences on the other counts. Defendant appealed his conviction and argued that the trial court erred in failing to provide him with notice of his right under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-195 to sentence review. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court granted defendant's petition for certification. The court noted that under &sect; 51-195, a sentence resulting from a plea agreement was not subject to review. The court held that defendant's agreement was not a plea agreement under the terms of the statute because no specific term of years was determined.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 51-195 and that he be allowed to file an application for sentence review within 30 days of his receipt of such notice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff landowners appealed the judgment on remand of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Danbury (Connecticut), which dismissed their appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners contended that they were deprived of their property rights unconstitutionally by the refusal of the commission to grant in its entirety their application for a permit to expand their sand and gravel mining activities and that the denial of the permit to excavate the entire area constituted a taking as a matter of law in view of the evidence of the financial benefits they were prevented from realizing. The court affirmed the judgment dismissing the landowners' appeal holding that the landowners' claims of no competent evidence to support the finding that the value of the property had increased as a result of the commission's grant of a permit was frivolous, because the testimony and report of the landowners' own expert witness amply supported that finding.The court further found that the trial court did not depart from the remand order because the remand order of the court was not so limited as to have precluded other methods of resolving the issue. The court further rejected efforts to construe remand orders so narrowly as to prohibit a trial court from considering matters relevant to the issues that were not envisioned at the time of the remand.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that his resentencing violated due process and double jeopardy not because his new sentence was greater than the old one, but because it was greater in proportion to the maximum sentence statutorily available. Defendant argued that his sentence for murder was only five-sixths of the maximum allowed whereas his sentence for manslaughter was the maximum allowed. The court affirmed, holding that defendant's sentence on remand was not more severe than the one imposed for his murder conviction. The court held that in order to determine whether a sentence was more severe, it was necessary to examine the overall impact on defendant.

The court on appeal reversed the judgment of the trial court based on its determination that &sect; 22a-43(c) did not permit the commission's approval of the proposed settlement without the consent of all of the parties to the pending appeal, including the association as an intervening defendant, because the settlement agreement modified the decision of the commission as an inland wetlands agency. The court noted that the legislative intent was clear that a settlement agreement between all parties was a condition precedent for approval of any settlement involving withdrawal of an appeal to the commission and the court's failure to recognize that requirement was plain error.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court improperly allowed the admission of an in court identification of defendant after an unnecessarily suggestive pretrial identification procedure had been conducted. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that having defendant seated at the defense table in open court was inherently suggestive, but not unnecessarily suggestive, because defendant had no constitutional right to a lineup. The court also held that the trial court properly instructed the jury on the issue of identification because the instructions given included the material portions of both the model Telfaire charge and defendant's request and, as such, provided sufficient guidance to the jury on the issue of eyewitness identification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commissioner filed a petition for enforcement, seeking to enjoin defendants from operating two unlicensed substance abuse treatment facilities. The superior court granted the request for a permanent injunction, and the court affirmed the judgment on appeal. Thereafter, the commissioner filed a motion for contempt, alleging that defendants were violating the injunction by continuing to operate two unlicensed substance abuse treatment facilities. The court held the facilities in contempt and modified the injunction. The facilities claimed that there being no drug or alcohol dependent persons in its two drug treatment centers, the superior court erred in finding the facilities in contempt of the injunction. A review of the evidence presented to the superior court, however, revealed sufficient evidence to support a conclusion that the facilities two drug treatment homes were both were still operating substance abuse treatment facilities in violation of the injunction. The court further held that the trial court did not improperly modify the injunction at the contempt hearing and that such modification did not violate the facilities' due process rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a decision from the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Haven (Connecticut), which, upon a jury verdict, convicted defendant of two counts of robbery in the first degree, one count of kidnapping in the first degree pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-92(a)(2)(A), one count of kidnapping in the first degree pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-92(a)(2)(B), and one count of burglary in the third degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was additionally convicted of one count of sexual assault in the first degree. The court noted that the jury could have reasonably found that defendant followed the victim into her apartment building and forced his way into her apartment. Defendant demanded valuables and claimed to have a gun. He also engaged in nonconsensual sexual intercourse with the victim. Defendant forced the victim to go to her ATM and withdraw money for defendant. Defendant argued, in part, that he was punished twice for the offense of first-degree kidnapping and for the first-degree robbery violation and that the trial court deprived him of a fair trial because he was shackled during trial. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) the charged crimes of kidnapping in the first degree under &sect; 53a-92(a)(2)(A), (B) were separate offenses for double jeopardy purposes; (2) where the State charged defendant with the robbery at her apartment and at the ATM, they were two separate and distinct robberies and the trial court was authorized to punish defendant separately for each offense; and (3) the precautionary measures taken by the trial court minimized the potential prejudicial effect of the shackles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Agency of the Town of Greenwich appealed a judgment from the Appellate Court (Connecticut), which affirmed a judgment by the trial court in favor of plaintiff landowner on the landowner's takings claim in the landowner's appeal of the Agency's denial of the landowner's application for a building permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Agency denied the landowner's fourth application for a building permit after denying three previous applications on the merits. The landowner appealed to the trial court, which determined that the Agency's action constituted a taking of the landowner's property. The intermediate appellate court affirmed. The Agency appealed, contending that testimony from the landowner's own appraiser demonstrated the speculative nature of the landowner's purchase and that a claim of diminution of value should have been appraised by the injury to or loss of value of the property in its natural state. On appeal, the court held that the landowner failed to show that the Agency would not have allowed any reasonable residential development of the property and, therefore, a decision on the merits of the landowner's takings claim was premature. Although the landowner submitted four applications, only three were actually reviewed on their merits. The court could not have said the Agency would have rejected a more modest proposal if one had been offered by the landowner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the intermediate appellate court, which had affirmed the trial court's judgment for the landowner, and remanded to the intermediate appellate court with direction to remand the case to the trial court with direction to render judgment for the Agency on the landowner's takings claim.</SPAN></P>

The trial court concluded that by failing to disclose fully the costs of his representation and by failing to make an unequivocal effort to ensure that the complainant obtained independent counsel, the attorney was guilty of professional misconduct. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the lower court holding that the attorney was suspended from the practice of law for three months. The court rejected the attorney's claim that the presentment should have been dismissed for failure to comply with Comm. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 31(a). The court noted that &sect; 31(a) contained no penalty for noncompliance and purported only to establish a time limit for acting upon complaints.

He left to find the victim's knapsack and never returned. Defendant was charged with kidnapping, robbery, larceny, and assault. On direct examination, defendant admitted that he falsely stated an alibi to a detective. Defendant was convicted, and he appealed. The court held that where defendant failed to preserve error, there was nothing to review, even where defendant alleged unpreserved constitutional claims. Thus, it was impossible for the court to determine whether defendant's constitutional rights had been impaired, and his claims failed. Defendant's challenge to the trial court's instruction on consciousness of guilt was properly viewed as evidentiary rather than constitutional because the instruction identified a permissive inference, which could be drawn from defendant's false statement. Finally, the trial court's two-inference instruction did not impermissibly dilute the State's burden of proof or the presumption of innocence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court had to determine the meaning and scope of a proviso contained within Conn. Gen.

The court construed &sect; 52-557n to provide that an action under the highway defect statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 13a-149, was a plaintiff's exclusive remedy against a municipality or other political subdivision for damages resulting from injury to any person or property by means of a defective road or bridge. It also, therefore, precluded a joint action seeking such damages against a municipality and its officer pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-465 (a). On balance, &sect; 13a-149 afforded a constitutionally adequate right to redress for injuries arising out of highway defects. Section 52-557n, by implicitly barring claims for loss of consortium based on highway defects, did not restrict the right to redress for an actionable injury but, rather, redefined the injury or the class of persons injured to which the constitutional right of redress attached.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial court, holding that the trial court should not have considered the validity of the subdivision regulation in the context of the individuals' zoning appeal. The court concluded that the appropriate procedural vehicle for the individuals' attack on the regulation was a declaratory judgment action, and not an appeal from its enactment. The court held that because the individuals' claims constituted a general attack on the validity of the regulation, it should have been presented by way of a declaratory judgment action in which other property owners who might have had an interest would have had the opportunity to intervene and be heard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">To settle an audit of excess construction costs of the utility company's nuclear power plant, Millstone III, the utility company and DPUC entered into a settlement agreement that limited recognition of Millstone III costs for retail ratemaking to $ 3.4 billion. The utility company's wholesale power sales rate schedules were determined by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which had allowed an additional $ 400 million in Millstone III costs in establishing wholesale sales rates. The utility company alleged that the additional $ 400 million was &quot;nonutility property,&quot; that the revenue attributable to wholesale sales should be excluded from utility company's rate base, and that 10 percent of the wholesale sales should be allocated to shareholders. The utility company challenged the DPUC's refusal to include utility company's electric deferred fuel balance (DFB) in the rate base. The court held there was substantial evidence to support DPUC's decision. Millstone III was a single unit, and no part of it was &quot;nonutility&quot; property. The settlement agreement as to includable costs for Millstone III was controlling. The electric DFB was recovered by a 10-year amortization.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the trial court improperly allowed evidence of defendant's commission of a subsequent crime in order to prove identification and that that improper admission constituted harmful error. The court held that, under the totality of the circumstances even if the court considered all the common features together, the pattern that emerged was not such a distinctive combination of circumstances and actions that a &quot;signature&quot; or &quot;criminal logo&quot; could be discerned.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, who included a builder, appealed a decision of the Superior Court at Hartford (Connecticut), which dismissed plaintiffs' appeal of a decision by defendant Commissioner of Environmental Protection (DEP). The DEP had found that plaintiffs had built and operated an unpermitted solid waste disposal facility, and plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of the relevant statute and the adequacy of the superior court's review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The DEP charged plaintiffs with depositing waste at an unpermitted solid waste dump, and ordered plaintiffs to cease operations and to remove all solid waste besides &quot;clean fill&quot; from the site. A DEP hearing officer affirmed the order and the superior court affirmed that decision. Plaintiffs appealed, claiming: (1) insufficiency of the evidence, (2) the superior court should have reviewed the DEP enforcement order, and (3) Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-207(4) and (6) (Rev. 1985) was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the superior court in part and reversed it in part. The court found that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-207(6) could be reasonably construed as being limited to contiguous property that was intended to be a single dumpsite and that the statute was therefore not impossible to obey. The court also noted that had the builder been confused by the statute, it could have sought clarification from the DEP. The builder had shown neither inadequate notice of what was prohibited nor arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The court held, however, that by affirming the DEP's decision without evaluating the cleanup order, the superior court failed to comply with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-183(j).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the superior court on the issue of liability and found the relevant statute to be constitutional, but the court reversed the judgment on the refusal to review the DEP remedial orders. The court remanded the matter for proceedings consistent with its opinion. The court directed the superior court to vacate the DEP orders and remand the matter to the DEP if it found the orders to be an abuse of agency discretion.</SPAN></P>

After the trial court vacated the felony murder conviction and its prison sentence to 25 years to life, defendant appealed the capital felony conviction and its prison sentence to 25 years to life. The court affirmed. The trial court properly vacated the felony murder conviction. There was no impropriety in admitting defendant's prior testimony. A jury charge equated defendant's transcript testimony with in-court testimony and instructed the jury to consider the prior testimony for the truth of the matters asserted. The charge was correct. The trial court correctly charged the jury on the State's burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, on the presumption of innocence, and that the jury could not draw an unfavorable inference from defendant's failure to testify. There was no reasonable possibility that the charge misled the jury. The trial court allowed defendant ample cross-examination designed to impeach of the State's primary witness, which was sufficient to satisfy defendant's constitutional right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment. Testimony about the policeman's medical treatment was irrelevant, but was harmless.</SPAN></P>

Finding that the questions on cross-examination exceeded the scope of the permitted direct examination, the court held that the trial court committed no abuse of discretion in limiting the cross-examination. Defendant's theory of the case was that the witnesses lied to protect one of the witness's brother. Defendant's counsel attempted to question one of the witnesses about a conversation between the brother and another accused. The court held that cross-examination was restricted to matters covered in the direct examination, except as they involve credibility alone. A review of the transcript revealed that the subject matter of the questions on cross-examination exceeded the scope of the direct examination. The trial court had discretion to determine the relevancy and the remoteness of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. Defendant alleged that he was denied a fair cross section of jurors because the trial court conducted the voir dire process on the first day of the Jewish holiday of Passover. However, the court found no merit in this claim because &quot;observant&quot; Jews were not a distinct and cognizable group within the community. A group was considered &quot;cognizable&quot; only upon a showing that the group had a definite composition, and the membership would not vary from day to day. Second, the court found no merit in defendant's assertion that he was denied the intelligent exercise of his peremptory challenges. A jury was presumed to follow the court's instructions. If a juror had served on a prior jury that voted to convict, that was not prejudice to defendant's case. Finally, defendant was not denied proper cross-examination. The trial court had properly declined to grant defendant latitude in cross-examination.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court should not have come to its conclusion that the ordinance was invalid without hearing the factual evidence offered by the district in support of the ordinance's validity. At trial, in support of its claim, the district sought to present expert testimony that the purpose of the amended sewer ordinance was to ensure fair availability of the sewer system to all properties and that the restrictions in the amended sewer ordinance appropriately reflected the design, functioning, capacity, and operation of the sewer district treatment plant and sewer system. The court determined that that evidence was relevant to the issue of whether the ordinance, as amended, was rationally related to the operation and maintenance of a sewerage system and, thus, a legitimate exercise of the police power. The court concluded, therefore, that the trial court should not have adjudicated the validity of the ordinance without first considering the evidence offered by the district.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that a party who challenged a statute on constitutional grounds had no easy burden, for every intendment was made in favor of constitutionality, and invalidity was required to be established beyond a reasonable doubt. The court affirmed the judgment convicting defendant, concluding that a damaging confession which could later be suppressed at the trial level on the ground that it was involuntary and illegally obtained by the police could be admitted at a preliminary hearing.</SPAN></P>

Such argument was permitted by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-216b. Defendant contended the statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment for plaintiff on the issue of damages and liability. The statute did not violate the separation of powers doctrine by impeding within the exclusive control of the judiciary. Although trial courts had broad discretion to control oral arguments, there was never a rule that stated that the court's authority was exclusive of concurrent legislative jurisdiction. The history of the statute undermined defendant's claim that the legislature intended to abrogate the power of the court to discipline attorneys or to control their statements during oral argument. The statute's incorporation of a provision for curative instructions when attorneys mention damages meant the statute did not violate defendant's right to a trial by jury. The trial court did not err by instructing the jury that it could consider plaintiff's alleged inability to participate in karate activities in regard to both past and future damages.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed because the construction and application of the regulation that was adopted by the board and upheld by the trial court was not unreasonable, arbitrary or illegal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State brought an action to enjoin the ticket sellers from charging more than three dollars over face value, for restitution, and for a civil penalty. The trial court granted summary judgment to the State. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-289, regulating ticket sales, did not violate equal protection or due process and that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-110b(a) was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The court ruled that allowing property owners holding events to sell tickets at higher prices did not violate equal protection because it was reasonably related to the statute's purpose to promote access, protect the public, and prevent economic loss. The court found that the ticket sellers' charges were not valid delivery charges, but were based on the quality of the ticket, the location and desirability of the seat, and the cost of procuring it. The court ruled that the action was properly filed, although no consumer complaints were received, because the consumer protection commission had a sufficient factual belief that the ticket sellers engaged in unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive practices under Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The companies operated mining, excavation, and gravel processing facilities located in industrial and industrial park zones within the town. Both companies increasingly relied upon imported earth products from outside the town. The commission amended zoning regulations so as to prohibit the accessory processing of earth products excavated beyond town limits. Following the adoption of the amendments, the companies appealed to the superior court. Each company raised similar claims that adoption of the amendments illegally restricted their right to continue valid nonconforming uses of their respective properties. The superior court sustained their appeals in part, and the commission sought review. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The court disagreed with the superior court's holding that the town's amended zoning regulations were facially invalid because they illegally infringed upon nonconforming uses, or discriminated based on the source of materials, in contravention of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-2. The court held that by definition, accessory uses had to be located on the same lot, and had to be subordinate and customarily incidental to, the principal use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant commissioner of revenue services informed plaintiff taxpayer that it was required to collect and remit sales and use taxes because it satisfied the definition of being engaged in business in the state pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-407(15). In determining whether any of the asserted contacts established some minimum connection between plaintiff and the state, the court found that defendant's claim ignored the fact that plaintiff's catalogs became the property of the residents, and that the use of a toll-free &quot;800&quot; number for Connecticut residents to place orders did not demonstrate a sufficient link to Connecticut. Defendant made no claim that plaintiff was incorporated or maintained for the purpose of evading sales and use taxes, and no such claim would be credible based upon the evidence presented at trial. Defendant's bald assertion that plaintiff purposely availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in Connecticut, thus invoking the benefits and protection of its laws, fails to clarify how plaintiff was benefitted by local government when its contacts to Connecticut were solely through the United States mail and common carriers.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that merely because the victim asserted that she should have been awarded a larger sum for past and future noneconomic damages did not justify setting aside the verdict. The court determined that the legislature intended Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-225d(b)(3) to provide an award of fees even in the absence of a specific demand for them in the pleadings because the statute was mandatory and, therefore, no valid purpose was served by hinging its application to a pleading requirement.

The court examined the record and found that the pedestrian had actually proved the location of his fall in his original evidence although neither the trial court nor counsel had remembered it, so that the additional repetitive evidence was not essential for the pedestrian to establish a prima facie case. The court declined to review a claim that 1989 Conn. Acts 319, which permitted counsel to argue mathematical formulas for damages in closing arguments, was unconstitutional.

At trial, the State offered police testimony describing the victim's identification of defendant from a photographic array when it could not find the victim. The court held that the testimony should have been excluded as hearsay because it did not fall within any exception to the hearsay rule. As to the hearing transcript, the State contended that the victim's testimony was properly admitted under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule, and was coupled with indicia of reliability adequate to satisfy the demands of the Confrontation Clause. The record indicated that the victim's testimony was given under oath, subject to criminal penalties for perjury before a tribunal that kept a judicial record.

Defendant signed the agreement and was charged with escape for his single failure to report to his supervising officer. The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss. On appeal from his conviction, the court reversed and remanded, holding that &sect; 53a-169(a)(2) did not penalize as an &quot;escape&quot; a single failure to report to a supervisor and proof of such failure to report was insufficient to prove defendant guilty of an escape. The term &quot;escape,&quot; under &sect; 53a-169(a)(2), contemplated an unauthorized departure from, or failure to return to, a &quot;community residence.&quot; Also, the commissioner's authority to promulgate rules of conduct for persons transferred to a &quot;community residence&quot; did not include the authority to define &quot;escape&quot; to include conduct that the legislature had not criminalized.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 22a-36 to 22a-45, and that it was a valid exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

The Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act (IWWA), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-42(c), provided that a town could promulgate regulations necessary to protect the wetlands and watercourses within its territorial limits.Such regulation had to be in conformity with the regulations adopted pursuant to the IWWA, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-39. The court rejected the contention that the regulation was invalid because it was not in conformity with the statutory scheme set forth in the IWWA. The court thus rejected the assertion that the factors promulgated by the IWWA, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-41, had to be applied on a case-by-case basis and that the regulation, which made no provision for variations of its requirements through a permit process, was invalid because it conflicted with the procedures contemplated by the IWWA.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the text, the history, and the policy embodied in Conn. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff inmate, who was acquitted of a charge of murder by reason of mental disease or defect, sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Ansonia-Milford (Connecticut), which denied the inmate's attempt to enjoin the psychiatric security review board (PSRB) from exercising jurisdiction over him. Defendants, a state hospital and other authorities, claimed the inmate failed to exhaust administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court first addressed defendants' contention that the inmate was required to exhaust administrative remedies before instituting his action. The court agreed with the trial court that because an agency should not be called upon to determine whether the statute that created it was unconstitutional, there was no need for the inmate to have exhausted administrative remedies. The inmate contended that the statute creating the PSRB was a quasi-criminal statute that violated the ex post facto prohibition of U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 10. The court affirmed the trial court's holding that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17-257b was not an ex post facto law. The court reasoned that the ex post facto prohibition applied to punishments and that the confinement of individuals with dangerous mental diseases or defects was not a punishment. Finally, the court rejected the inmate's claim that the act was improperly invoked to review the inmate's psychiatric status. The court pointed out that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17-257f expressly authorized the PSRB to conduct periodic hearings to review acquittees' status at least every other year.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners intended to cut trees within the stream channel encroachment lines in order to expand their agricultural crop land. The DEP issued a cease and desist order directing the property owners to stop cutting trees because they had failed to apply for a permit as provided in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-342. The property owners asserted that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-349 prohibited the DEP from applying Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-342 and subjecting them to the permit process. The court found that: 1) the DEP's jurisdictional authority to require the property owners to obtain permits was limited to the placement of obstructions or encroachments within the lines; 2) whether the property owners' proposed activity within the stream channel encroachment lines was an obstruction or encroachment and whether the proposed use of their land was an agricultural or farming use within Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-349 were factual determinations best left to the DEP; 3) by requiring the property owners to submit to the permit process under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-342, the DEP could make that decision; 4) the appeal to a superior court was not warranted until denial of the permit.</SPAN></P>

The court held that appellee's promulgation of Reg. &sect; 42-110b-19(e), preventing merchants offering a manufacturer's rebate from displaying the net price of an item unless the rebate was available to the customer at the time of purchase, did not exceed appellee's authority under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-110b(b, c). Reg. &sect; 42-110b-19(e) was not inconsistent with the rules of Federal Trade Commission--intended as guidance under Conn. Gen.

In addition, Reg. &sect; 42-110b-19(e) had received approval from the legislative review committee as required under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-170. The court held that the regulation did not violate U.S. Const. amend. I or Conn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 4, 5.

The court stated that the taxpayer failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that &sect; 22a-132 violated the federal and state guarantees of equal protection.

On appeal the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that, while the State's use of defendant's post-Miranda refusal to sign his transcribed statement violated defendant's due process rights, the error was harmless in light of other evidence presented at trial. The State in its closing argument twice made reference to defendant's failure to sign his statement in an attempt to impeach that statement. The court found that defendant had clearly manifested his exercise of his right to remain silent. However, the court concluded that the record indicated that the State did not focus on or highlight defendant's invocation of his right to silence. The court noted that the State made only two references to defendant's failure to sign his statement and that those references were not the centerpiece of the State's case. Furthermore, because defendant failed to object to the State's references, the court determined that the failure to object or move for a mistrial indicated that defendant's counsel did not consider the State's comments to have substantially prejudiced defendant.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found ample support for the commissioner's findings and concluded that the demolitionists had violated the commissioner's orders. The court held that the trial court had not erred in concluding that the demolitionists had violated the terms of the commissioner's orders but that the trial court had erred in imposing civil penalties against the demolitionists pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-250(c) in the second and fourth cases for dumping certain waste in two towns as &sect; 22a-250(c) was inapplicable because demolitionists had dumped on such land with the full knowledge and consent of the property owners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of arson after his family's retail business was damaged by fire. On appeal, defendant asserted that some of the prosecutor's statements during closing argument had no foundation and deprived defendant of his right to a fair trial and an impartial jury. Specifically, defendant objected to the prosecutor's remark that the autodialer, when activated by a single breach of the security system's sensor beam in the retail business, repeatedly dialed defendant's contact number. Defendant contended, and the court agreed, that the prosecutor's conclusion was not established by the evidence. However, the court ruled that the comments were not so prejudicial as to deprive defendant of the opportunity for a fair trial and that the superior court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the request for a curative instruction. The court also held that the superior court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded a prior consistent statement, offered for impeachment purposes, made by a defense witness. The remark was not substantially inconsistent with testimony and did not sufficiently relate to a material matter. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction, but remanded the case for resentencing. The court noted that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-35a instituted a definite sentencing scheme for any felony committed on or after July 1, 1981, and thereby implicitly repealed the indeterminate sentencing aspect of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-278(a). The court agreed with defendant that in compliance with the definite sentencing requirement of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-35a, the proper construction of the remaining penalty provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-278(a) was a definite sentence anywhere within the statutory range of five years to life set forth in that statute.

The parents contended that &sect; 46b-59 was unconstitutional. The trial court granted a motion for reservation upon stipulated facts. The court declined to answer the reserved question because insufficient facts were presented. A party challenging the constitutionality of a statute was required to provide an adequate factual record in order to meet its burden of demonstrating the statute's adverse impacted on some protected interest of his own, in his own particular case. The court did not give advisory opinions, based on some set of hypothetical facts. Neither the parent's general right to raise their children without unwarranted state interference nor their stipulated status as an intact family provided the court with a basis to consider their constitutional claims on the incomplete record. The court determined that the custodial rights of an intact family did not automatically preclude the visitation rights of grandparents. Based on the record, the constitutionality of &sect; 46b-59 was not ripe for adjudication.</SPAN></P>

However, the trial court held that the radio of one of the petitioners could not be returned to him because it contained a recording device. Both the warden and that petitioner appealed. The court reversed the decision that the warden's policy violated the Constitution while affirming the decision concerning that petitioner. The court held that petitioners did not show that the warden's radio policy violated the First Amendment. There was no First Amendment distinction between regular sound-emitting radios and headphone radios, and, therefore, no First Amendment issue was involved. There was no error when the trial court overturned the decision to return the one prisoner's radio to him when new information was discovered that the radio had a forbidden recording device.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court transferred the parties' appeal from the appellate court pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. App. P. &sect; 4023. The parties argued that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-21 in providing those relationships which were prohibited from marrying did not specify that half blood relations could not marry and that that statute along with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-91 a penal statute criminalizing incest between the relationships specified in &sect; 46b-21 should not be so construed. The court looked to the history of the incest law noting that since 1702 marriage between persons related by either consanguinity or affinity was prohibited. The court refused to narrowly construe the statutes so as to thwart the legislative intent. The court held that the degrees of relationship within which marriages were prohibited were not words of art. Rather, as fairly read, the prohibition against intermarriage of those related by consanguinity can be understood to extend to those of the half blood as well as of the whole blood.Therefore, a marriage between persons related to one another as half uncle and half niece was void under &sect;&sect; 46b-21 and 53a-191 as incestuous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate and respondent warden both challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Tolland (Connecticut), which granted judgment to the inmate relating to one disciplinary proceeding, reinstated good time credits for that incident, and granted the warden's motion to quash the claims relating to 20 other disciplinary actions. The inmate brought the habeas corpus action alleging constitutional errors in the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A written report of an investigating correction officer was the sole basis for the disciplinary committee's finding that the inmate petitioner was guilty of misconduct for the assault in question. The inmate unsuccessfully attacked the constitutionality of the disciplinary hearing in federal court under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and then filed the instant action in state court. The trial court held that res judicata did not apply. On appeal, the court disagreed. In both actions, the inmate alleged that his inability to call the victim and the officer as witnesses deprived him of due process, so the federal court adjudicated the identical claim. Federal courts lacked the authority to restore good time credits, but the proposition that parallel proceedings in federal and state courts were allowed to expedite proceedings when administrative error was shown to exist did not justify relitigation of constitutional issues that had been found to be groundless. The warden's motion to quash was properly granted because a new rule imposing a substantive evidentiary standard to the revocation of good time credits added a new due process requirement that did not apply retrospectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court set aside the judgment of the trial court that entered judgment for the inmate, directed judgment for the warden, and set aside the restoration of the inmate's good time credits. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that granted the warden's motion to quash.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue reserved for the court was one of statutory construction. The court was asked whether the sales commissions paid by taxpayer parent companies to their domestic international sales corporation (DISC) and deducted on their federal income tax returns were expenses related to the dividends received by the taxpayers from the DISC within the meaning of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-217 (a) (D) (1) so that the commissions were not deductible to the extent of the dividends received in determining the taxpayers' tax liability. The taxpayers contended that the statute was intended to eliminate, in part, the corporation business tax on dividends, and not, as the commissioner concluded, to disallow the deduction of commission expenses to the extent of dividends that were paid to a parent company by its DISC. The court found the taxpayers' argument unpersuasive because it found the statute to be unambiguous. The court found that the sales commissions were expenses related to dividends because they were directly responsible for generating the dividends paid by the DISCs to their parent companies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court answered in the affirmative to the question of law reserved. The question pertained to the disallowance of certain deductions of sales commission expenses by parent company taxpayers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A dispute arose between a liquor importer and a new distributor regarding the acquisition of the importer's distribution rights. The liquor department determined that &sect; 33-369(c) vested the new distributor with the importer's rights and that was compatible with the Liquor Control Act, particularly Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-17. The court affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the appeal of that decision. No reasonable statutory basis supported the assertion that &sect; 30-17 and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 33-369(c) could not coexist. The legislature presumably had knowledge of existing laws. Thus, &sect; 33-369(c) applied to the importer's agreement with the old distributor. Pursuant to &sect; 33-369(c), the merger vested in the new distributor the rights of the old distributor by operation of law. That automatic vesting did not deprive the importer of its Fourteenth Amendment or procedural due process rights. The liquor department had a legitimate interest in controlling the liquor industry. Also, the importer had no right to a hearing to contest automatic vesting. Finally, the court lacked jurisdiction over the importer's antitrust claims because such claims were exclusively federal.</SPAN></P>

The trial court rendered judgment for the partnership, thus invalidating the assessment on the ground that it was not determined on the basis of the actual benefit to the subject property adjusted to the time of the initial assessment. The authority appealed and claimed that the trial court erred in finding that the partnership's evidence was sufficient to overcome the presumption of the validity of the supplemental assessment. The court determined that because the partnership did not produce any evidence that the total assessment, both initial and supplemental, exceeded the difference in the market value of its property with and without sewers as of the time of the original assessment, the presumption of the validity of the assessment had not been overcome and the trial court's conclusion to the contrary was clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant contended that his suit could be maintained because the claims commissioner had authorized him to bring the action against the State pursuant to Conn.

The trial court granted summary judgment to the State on the ground that as a state employee in the classified service, he had no contractual rights, express or implied, against the State as his employer but only those rights made available to state employees by statute. The court did not reach the substantive issues. The unconstitutionality of the special act defeated the trial court's jurisdiction to entertain the action. The special act allowing the state employee to sue the State despite failure to present his claim to the claims commissioner within the time allowed by Conn. Gen.

The injunction, after referral to a referee, was granted, but reversed on appeal. On further appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the statement in Conn. Gen.

Acts. 84-331 was to limit the application of local zoning regulations to land owned by the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, but not to private land, such as that owned by the dump operator. The court concluded that trial referee's decision regarding the constitutionality of the regulation was not clearly erroneous because the zoning regulation enjoyed a presumption of constitutionality and there was no evidence to establish its unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>

The zoning commission was the sole defendant. The zoning commission filed a motion to dismiss the landowners' appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the clerk of the municipality was not served pursuant to the provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8(b). The landowners claimed that 1988 Conn. Acts 88-79, &sect; 3 saved their appeal. The trial court granted the zoning commission's motion and denied the landowners' motion to set aside the dismissal, and the landowners appealed. The Supreme Court took the appeal pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book &sect; 4023. The court held that although 1988 Conn. Acts 88-79, &sect; 3 saved appeals with merely technical defects, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8(b) required that the clerk of the municipality at least be given copies of the pleadings. In dismissing the appeal, the court held that failure to name the clerk and to provide copies of the pleadings were more than mere technical defects and warranted dismissal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff administrator challenged an order of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Haven (Connecticut), which granted the motion of defendants, the State of Connecticut and its commissioner of correction, to dismiss an action to recover damages for the wrongful death of decedent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The administrator alleged that the deliberate indifference to the decedent's serious medical needs while he was incarcerated directly resulted in his death. The trial court dismissed defendants from the action, holding that it was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The court affirmed the order and held that the State could not be sued without its consent. The administrator was unable to point to any statute that waived the State's sovereign immunity and did not receive permission from the claims commissioner to bring an action against the State. The court concluded that 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 was not intended to override sovereign immunity of the State. Although immunity could be waived by the claims commissioner under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-160, that did not happen in this case and, thus, the lower court had no jurisdiction to hear a claim for monetary damages. The court stated that 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 did not give the lower court authorization to borrow the language in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-160 to determine if the State could be liable. The court concluded that &sect; 1988 was only applicable when federal law was inapplicable or in some way deficient.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that neither the court nor the trial court should engage in any further definition of the term because that task fell within the legislature's domain. The State maintained that the court had an independent responsibility for statutory construction. The court agreed with the State. The court ruled that within a capital felony context, the term &quot;especially cruel&quot; had to include the intentional infliction of extreme pain or torture above and beyond that necessarily accompanying the underlying killing. The court adopted that definition of &quot;especially cruel&quot; as an acceptable core construction of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-46a(h)(4).</SPAN></P>

Trying defendant for two counts of kidnapping and for both attempted sexual assault and sexual assault did not violate double jeopardy, because defendant was only sentenced for one count of kidnapping and for attempted sexual assault. The trial court's instructions as a whole properly explained that defendant could only be guilty of first degree kidnapping if he were also guilty of the underlying felony. It was not reversible error to give the jury a missing witness instruction, because defendant did not timely object and because the evidence indicated that defendant failed to produce two witnesses who were able to testify, were within his power to produce, and would support his claim that he knew the victim socially.

The Superior Court, Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain (Connecticut) declared Lemon Law II to be constitutional and rendered judgment for the state. The associations appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The associations sought review of the statutory procedures under Lemon Law II, specifically the arbitration of motor vehicle disputes that, for manufacturers but not for consumers, severely limited the scope of judicial review for challenges to adverse arbitration determinations. The trial court concluded that the associations had failed to establish any violation of their state or federal constitutional rights. On appeal, the court held that the associations were not deprived of their right to a trial by jury because the record demonstrated the essentially equitable nature of the Lemon Law II claims. The associations were not entitled to relief from filing fees because there was a rational nexus between the legislature's goal of creating a fiscally independent arbitration mechanism for automobile consumers and the requirement that manufacturers pay the fee. The court held, however, that the judicial review provisions did not satisfy constitutional due process requirements. The arbitration procedures were compulsory and, thus, the limited review provided was constitutionally insufficient and constituted disparate treatment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commissioner assessed the taxpayer a tax on hazardous waste that was shipped from one of the taxpayer's plants. The taxpayer alleged that because it did not generate the hazardous waste, it was not subject to a hazardous waste assessment. The Commissioner argued that the taxpayer was liable for the assessment under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-132(a)(1) because it had to file the uniform hazardous waste manifest required by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976. The court agreed with the taxpayer and held that neither the statutes nor the regulations authorized the imposition of an assessment on hazardous waste that was not generated by the shipper. The court stated that the material was not produced by the taxpayer but only shipped to the taxpayer for treatment. The court determined that the taxpayer had to identify itself on the federal form as the generator of the hazardous waste because the federal law prohibited any modification of the form. The taxpayer did explain in the space provided that the material had been shipped to its location by another company.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defendant's primary challenge to his convictions was based on whether the provision of Conn. Gen.

The court held that it was, and affirmed the defendant's convictions. The court stated that the statute did not conflict with any provision of the Connecticut constitution, and that the separate classification of child abuse victims in respect to competency requirements rested on a rational basis; that often the child is the only witness to the act, and, therefore, there was no equal protection violation. Additionally, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion when he refused the defendant's request to charge the jury on the credibility of a child witness. The defendant's claims that his rights of confrontation and to impeach witnesses were violated were examined by the court and any errors found were deemed harmless. The court found no errors in the trial court's jury instructions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was arrested and charged with manslaughter in the first degree. He was confined in jail for 293 days prior to trial and spent 378 days in a mental hospital while his competency to stand trial was determined.

The State declined to credit petitioner's pretrial jail time against the maximum term of his commitment and the trial court upheld the denial in petitioner's habeas corpus action in which he alleged an equal protection violation. On petitioner's appeal, the appellate court set aside the trial court's decision. On appeal, the court reversed the decision of the appellate court, holding that the State did not violate the guarantees of equal protection contained in the Connecticut and United States Constitutions by declining to credit the pretrial jail time. The State was not treating wealthy and poor insanity acquittees differently because, under Conn. Gen.

The court held that a warrantless search of the hatchback area of an automobile driven by defendant was valid as a search incident to a lawful arrest because the hatchback was an extension of the passenger compartment. It was not error to bar a defense witness's testimony that the owner of the automobile was a cocaine dealer where there was no direct evidence of the owner's involvement in the crime and defendant's possession of the automobile for two days immediately preceding his arrest attenuated the owner's connection to the automobile. &quot;Operability&quot; of the &quot;weapon&quot; was not an essential element of a violation of Conn.

Although the estate's claim was not necessarily barred by the delay from the decedent's death, that the family did not investigate the circumstances surrounding the decedent's suicide until one and one-half years after the death constituted as a matter of law a failure to exercise reasonable care to discover the accrual of the claim. The special legislation was essential because the legislature's rejection of the commissioner's recommendation that no award be granted to the estate did not authorize further consideration by the commissioner of the request for permission to sue.

The court reasoned that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-308's disfigurement coverage for scars had evolved from a system of enumerated inclusions to one of enumerated exclusions and that the hernia operation exclusion changed to an inguinal hernia operation exclusion to make the disfigurement provision consistent with the prior practice of allowing compensation for &quot;visible scars and to promote the state interest in compensating workers for those scars. The court also held that the exclusion rationally related to that interest by denying benefits for a disfigurement that was unlikely to be exposed to view.

The court considered whether the trial court erred in permitting three state's witnesses to testify and the prosecutor to comment that defendant, after his arrest and after he had been advised of his Miranda rights, requested the assistance of his attorney. Defendant contended that admission of this evidence violated his due process rights as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The court found that especially since defendant took the stand to testify in his own behalf, it was fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow his silence to be admitted as evidence against him at trial. But an examination of the record showed that neither the prosecutor nor the state's witnesses focused upon or highlighted defendant's invocation of his right to counsel. Furthermore, the evidence of defendant's guilt was overwhelming. Thus the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

They purchased or leased computers and related personal property on which they paid no sales tax. The taxpayers contended that that their purchases were not retail sales as defined by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-407(3) because the items had been purchased for resale and were not subject to the use tax under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-411. The court held that that the trial court committed no error. First, the language of the taxpayer's contracts with the state indicated that the property was incidental to the primary purpose of the contracts, which was to provide wagering systems, so it was not purchased or leased for resale and the assessment of the use tax was proper. Second, the abatement of penalties and interest was proper because the taxpayers had a firm and reasonably held belief in the correctness of their legal position, none of them brought suit for delay, and the relief was within the trial court's equitable powers pursuant to Conn.

This appeal then continued. Defendant argued &sect; 54-86g violated his right to confrontation. He also argued the remand order violated due process by allowing the State to create a record after the fact. The court found defendant did not show how the statute violated his right to confrontation and the burden was on him to do so.

Defendant was convicted of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 53a-70.

According to the court, the jury could properly have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the woman's words and actions could not reasonably be viewed to indicate her consent to intercourse.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">This was an appeal by a mother whose parental rights to her young son were terminated pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17-43a(b)(2) and (4). On appeal, the mother claimed that the trial court erred in concluding that she had failed to achieve a degree of personal rehabilitation that would allow her to assume a responsible position in the child's life. Pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17-43a(d), the trial court made specific findings regarding the statutory factors necessary for consideration in a proceeding to terminate parental rights. For example, the court found that the counseling services provided to the mother had little effect in improving her parenting skills. It also found that the mother had displayed little dedication to meeting obligations that she had agreed to, such as attending parenting skills programs.

The trial court was not clearly erroneous in concluding that there was clear and convincing evidence that defendant's physical presence would seriously have called into question the victim's reliability and trustworthiness as a witness. The State's expert witnesses testified that the victim would have experienced anxiety and trauma if required to testify before defendant, rendering the testimony less reliable. The trial court's conclusion on remand that the evidence was clear and convincing that defendant's physical presence would seriously have called into question the minor victim's reliability during the videotaping procedure was legally and logically correct, and was supported by the facts. Defendant gave no evidence to contradict their testimony that the victim would have been intimidated by his presence, and that such intimidation would have undermined the reliability of the victim's testimony.</SPAN></P>

Although the trial court committed error in failing to instruct the jury on the burden of proof relative to the affirmative defense of cohabitation, the court found that it was harmless error.

Before the trial court completed deliberations on the motion to dismiss, it received a letter from the defendants stating that, in light of the recent decision of the United States Supreme Court, the attorney general had advised that continued collection of the decal tax would violate the Commerce Clause. At issue was whether the truckers could recover the taxes, paid pursuant to an unconstitutional statute, or if they had to first pursue all administrative remedies.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner owned two building lots that a stream passed through or near.

The landowner requested permission to construct a single-family residence on each of his two lots, which was denied because the proposed construction was held to be inconsistent with the WPLO. The trial court did not consider the legality of the ordinance because it found that &sect; 7-147, the enabling statute for the ordinance, lacked sufficient standards to guide municipalities in enacting waterway protection ordinances under it. On appeal, the court held that the state legislature's delegation of power to the town could be challenged on the ground that the statute was unconstitutionally vague under traditional due process analysis, but that &sect; 7-147 protected against arbitrary and capricious action by local officials and that its language was sufficient to put an ordinary person on notice of what conduct could and could not have been engaged in under the law.</SPAN></P>

The principal issue was whether defendant had established that the state discriminatorily employed a peremptory challenge to exclude a black venireman from the jury that convicted him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court concluded that, on the record before it, defendant did not establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the state's use of a peremptory challenge to remove an individual from the venire was racially motivated. The trial court's conclusion was, therefore, not erroneous. The court determined that defendant cited no case law to support his theory that an instruction that the jury could consider whether prior statements were inconsistent implicated his sixth amendment right to confront the witnesses against him. Defendant also claimed that the trial court erred in its charge to the jury as to the limited purpose of the oral prior inconsistent statements. Because defendant had failed to comply with the procedures established for preserving review of his claim regarding the jury instruction, the court declined to review it.

Defendant zoning commission, acting as the town's inland wetlands board, had granted with modification the owners' application for permission to expand a mining and excavation operation under the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 22a-36 through 22a-45. The commission filed a cross appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners applied to the commission for permission to expand their mining operation within and adjacent to existing wetlands. The commission voted to reduce substantially the area upon which they sought to excavate. The commission issued a special permit with several conditions, including a performance bond. On appeal, the owners attempted to introduce evidence as to the economic effect on their property of the commission's failure to grant their excavation permit in accordance with their application, arguing that the commission's action constituted a taking without just compensation, &sect; 22a-43a(a). The trial court excluded the evidence and dismissed the appeal. The court dismissed the cross appeal because the commission was not aggrieved. The court found error in part as the trial court should have admitted the contested evidence. It would have been futile for the trial court to remand the case to an inland wetlands commission for the purpose of hearing evidence relevant only to the issue of an unconstitutional taking, which that agency might not have been empowered to resolve. Agencies were incompetent to decide certain constitutional issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff alleged victim filed suit against defendants, city and its police chief and officers, in the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford (Connecticut) for injuries sustained as a result of an alleged assault and battery. The victim claimed he was subject to a false arrest and the unjust use of force by the officers. The victim appealed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants alleged that the doctrine of collateral estoppel prevented the victim from relitigating his claims because a prior federal court case had already adjudicated the claims. The victim argued that the compensatory and punitive damages he received in the previous federal suit were compensation only for a violation of his civil rights, and that he was entitled to litigate his tort claims in a state court action. The court held that the elements of collateral estoppel were satisfied. Both causes of action arose out of the same alleged wrongs, allegedly committed by the same defendants, and involved the same injuries. 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 provided a remedy in the form of damages for actual injuries suffered by reason of a violation of the accused's civil rights. The issue of damages for those same injuries could not be relitigated in a state tort action when they had already been decided in the &sect; 1983 action. The jury in the federal court action was instructed in accordance with the common law rules of damages, the accused's damages were calculated in accordance with those rules, and he was compensated for the actual injuries he proved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The motorcycle operator was severely injured after colliding with the automobile. In a personal injury action against the automobile driver and owner, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the motorcycle operator, who filed a motion to set aside the verdict on the grounds that the amount of damages awarded by the jury was inadequate. The trial court granted the motion and ordered a new trial on the issue of damages. On appeal of the trial court's order, the appellate court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in setting aside the verdict and limiting the new trial to the issue of damages. The court agreed with the appellate court with respect to setting aside the verdict because the trial court properly found that the verdict shocked any sense of justice and was entirely disproportionate to the motorcycle operator's injury. However, the court remanded to the trial court for a trial on all issues because the issue of damages was so interwoven with the issue of liability that, in the interest of fairness, a new trial was mandated.</SPAN></P>

This appeal followed. The commissioners argued they did not violate the fire marshal's due process rights because she had no property right to her job and, even if that right existed, they gave the fire marshal sufficient process. The court found both parties knew and expected that the fire marshal would continue her employment until she were &quot;removed for cause&quot; as provided by the terms of the fire marshal's appointment under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-297. This created a property interest in the job for which the fire marshal was entitled to due process. Because the fire marshal was not afforded a meaningful opportunity to confront the accusations against her, and she was not given sufficient notice to challenge the findings against her, she was not given a sufficient pretermination hearing. She was thereby denied due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant park owner appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court (Connecticut) that found in favor of plaintiff administratrix in an action alleging violations of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21-79 and the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-110a et seq. The park owner also appealed from the denial of its counterclaim for unpaid rent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The administratrix's decedent owned a mobile home on a lot in the park owner's park. The administratrix desired to sell the home on-site, but the park owner refused to allow such sale and offered to buy the home for a fraction of its on-site fair market value. The administratrix alleged that the park owner's refusal to permit an on-site sale violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21-79 and that the park owner's dismantling of the home for off-site storage, inter alia, constituted a violation of CUTPA. The court held that the right of on-site sale given to a mobile home owner by &sect; 21-79 was not abrogated by restrictions imposed on such sale by another court in a previous action brought by the park owner against a town. The court further held that it was not a violation of CUTPA for the park owner to offer to purchase the mobile home at a depreciated price; however, it was a CUTPA violation for the park owner to have dismantled the home rather than evict the administratrix pursuant to the procedures of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21-80. The court also ruled that the trial court erred in denying the counterclaim for rent without considering the time period before the home was dismantled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed in part the judgment in favor of the administratrix, and it vacated and remanded that portion of the judgment that had awarded punitive damages and attorney's fees to the administratrix. It also vacated and remanded the denial of the park owner's counterclaim for unpaid rent.</SPAN></P>

Second, with regard to defendant's appeal, the question was whether the trial court violated the principles of double jeopardy in imposing two life sentences upon defendant, one for the murder of a victim and the other for the capital felony of killing of the same victim and another. The court found no error an affirmed defendant's conviction holding that the trial court did not err in imposing a life sentence, because the trial court articulated that it emphasized its exercise of discretion and its concern for the futility and expense of another trial and its adverse impact upon defendant, the victims' family, and society. The court further found that no error occurred in imposing two life sentences upon defendant, because double jeopardy did not preclude the imposition of one life sentence for each victim because the state has joined a separate count of murder to a count of capital felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was changed by substitute information with the crime of manslaughter in the first degree. The Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Haven (Connecticut), in which the state attempted to nolle the information, thereafter granted defendant's motion to dismiss. The superior court rendered judgment dismissing the case without prejudice, from which defendant appealed. At issue was whether dismissal without prejudice was erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A decision was required as to whether Conn. Gen. Prac. Book &sect; 819, which supposedly granted the option of dismissing the information either with or without prejudice, applied to defendant's demand to dismiss pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-56b. Section 819 appeared under the same heading as &sect; 815 and, as there was no other framework within which to construe &sect; 819, it must have been construed as complementary to &sect; 815. Section 815 contained no provision for a motion to dismiss as the proper vehicle for defendant to address the state's attempt to enter a nolle. The court concluded, therefore, that &sect; 819, which authorized entry of a dismissal with or without prejudice in response to defendant's &sect; 815 motion, had not applied to a &sect; 54-56b demand for dismissal. The dismissal of a criminal prosecution in response to a &sect; 54-56b demand was per se a dismissal with prejudice. Section 54-56b gave defendant the right to have charges disposed of with finality, which was only achieved by a dismissal with prejudice. It was the extrication of defendant from the judicial limbo to which he was exiled by the entry of a nolle prosequi or a dismissal without prejudice that was the aim of &sect; 54-56b.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As there was error, the judgment of dismissal without prejudice was set aside. The case was remanded to the superior court with direction to render a judgment of dismissal with prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court violated Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 in denying his motion to suppress certain evidence taken from his person and the motor vehicle that he was operating at the time of his arrest. The court disagreed. Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 proscribed unreasonable searches and seizures; however, there was no ready test for determining reasonableness other than by balancing the need to search or seize against the invasion that the search or seizure entailed. The actions observed by the arresting officer might have had more significance to him in determining whether the law was being violated at the given place and time than they would have to a layman. The officer's experience was entitled to some weight on the ultimate question of probable cause. Here, the officer, alone at 6:30 a.m. on the interstate with defendant and his passenger, legally conducted a search of defendant's person. The search of defendant's vehicle was also proper. The discovery of contraband in defendant's pockets, coupled with all the officer knew, including the fact that he was presented with a misdemeanant, gave him probable cause to search the vehicle for contraband.</SPAN></P>

The employer contended that the administrators' first action was barred by the exclusivity provision of the Workers' Compensation Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-924(a). The administrators' second complaint alleged that the employer was negligent in designing and constructing the underground storage facility and was liable under a dual capacity theory. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that the administrators' first action was barred by the exclusivity provision of the Workers' Compensation Act because the decedents' personal injuries were covered by the act, and any common-law recovery against the employer was barred. The court found that the administrators' dual capacity cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations and that the amended complaint did not relate back to the original complaint because it stated a new cause of action.</SPAN></P>

The owners alleged that the parties' rental agreement illegally prevented the owners from selling the mobile home while it remained on the corporation's lot.

It also issued a permanent injunction prohibiting the corporation from interfering with the on-site sale of the owners' mobile home and ordering the corporation to restore running water to the home. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the resale standard imposed by the corporation was prohibited by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21-79 because the requirements directly contravened &sect; 21-79; (2) Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21-70(c) provided authority to the Department of Consumer Protection (department) to approve resale standards, other than aesthetic ones, because the text of the statute plainly authorized the department to disapprove resale standards not conforming to law; and (3) Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21-79 did not violate the takings clause because the statute did not involve the actual physical occupation of land for a public purpose, served a substantial public purpose in protecting the economic interests of mobile home tenants, and did not unduly harm the economic interests of mobile home park owners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a jury of felony murder and sentenced to imprisonment for 45 years.

The court concluded that there was no reversible error and affirmed the judgment. Regarding defendant's fair trial claim, the court held that defendant failed to show that the likelihood of prejudice in his trial was so great as to raise an irrebutable presumption of prejudice, or that actual juror bias deprived him of a fair trial. The court held that defendant's statement was not suppressible because defendant's statement was not coerced, and it was knowingly and voluntarily given. Finally, the court held that the trial court's erroneous instruction on the standard of proof applicable to circumstantial evidence was harmless error, and thus did not provide a basis for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The trial court enjoined the increased use of the premises as a trucking terminal. The appellate court found that the owner had not been aggrieved by Norwich, Conn., Ordinances &sect; 10.2.2 and agreed with the trial court that the owner did not exhaust available administrative remedies. The court however applied an exception to the exhaustion of remedies principle and held that the owner could defend on the ground of the general invalidity of the ordinance, without exhausting all available administrative remedies. Where the owner contested the very validity of &sect; 10.2.2 , relief under &sect; 10.2.2 was inadequate or futile. The owner's situation was distinguishable from a case where a landowner challenged the validity of an ordinance as applied. The court rejected the owner's argument that &sect; 10.2.2 was unconstitutional because the city charter did not specifically confer authority to approve site plans on the commission.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court in the judicial district of Waterbury (Connecticut) which convicted him of risking injury to a minor in violation of Conn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant grabbed a 13-year old girl by the waist and said, &quot;I just want to feel you.&quot; He was convicted for risking the health of a minor in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21. He contended that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. On appeal, the court set aside the judgment of guilty and remanded with directions to vacate the conviction. The court held that &sect; 53-21 was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to manifest minimal guidelines by which innocent acts could be objectively and foreseeably distinguished from conduct that violated the statute. The court further held that judicial decisions did not make grabbing the waist of a fully clothed minor while uttering a sexually suggestive remark was not the type of lewd conduct prohibited by the morals clause of the statute. The court further held that case law required deliberate, blatant physical abuse to violate the health clause. Finally, the court declined to extrapolate guidelines for prosecution for impairing mental health of minors because &sect; 53-21 provided no tangible criteria, prior cases did not add definitive gloss, and the state offered no workable standards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The remanded with direction to vacate defendant's conviction. The court held that the controlling statute was unconstitutionally vague because defendant had no reasonable opportunity to know that his conduct was prohibited by the impairment of morals clause of the statute. The court further held that defendant's conduct did not come within the physical health clause because judicial gloss limited it to instances of deliberate, blatant abuse.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff administrators challenged a decision of the Superior Court (Connecticut), which granted defendant architectural firm summary judgment in the administrators' action for damages in connection with a bridge collapse that killed their loved ones.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The administrators argued that &sect; 52-584a, which applied to architects and engineers, was unconstitutional. They claimed that the statute impinged on their fundamental right of access to the courts. The court noted that a constitutional right to court access did not automatically translate every claim into one invoking fundamental rights. The court employed the rational basis test, and concluded that the classification of architects and engineers in a manner different from other groups involved in the construction process had a rational relationship to a legitimate state end. With the passage of time, it was more likely that any defect was caused by improper maintenance rather than defects in design. The court found that &sect; 52-584a did not violate Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 because at the time of the constitution's adoption, the administrators would not have been able to pursue the claims that they now maintained that the legislature unconstitutionally abrogated by enacting the statute. Thus, the administrators' causes of action for wrongful death furnished no basis for a claim of the statute's unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>

Absent a showing of immediate and irreparable harm, the physician could not institute an independent action. The board's suggested schedule to hear the department's case was a reasonable one that presented no constitutional infirmity.

Defendant's amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus was granted. The trial court was ordered to vacate the sentences and either to impose an effective sentence of not more than three years or to allow defendant to withdraw his pleas.

The trial court held that the allegations of constitutional violations were insufficient, and the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction by reason of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. On appeal, the court found no error and that the trial court correctly held that there was no subject matter jurisdiction. The court found that the unilateral expectation of benefits was not enough to create a constitutionally protected property interest within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that the constitutional claims had not been established and thus the doctrine of sovereign immunity operated as a bar to subject matter jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother claimed at oral argument that the case was moot because she had not been receiving AFDC benefits.

The mother further noted her continuing obligation as the parent of an AFDC beneficiary to repay to the State the full amount of any such aid paid to or on behalf of her children under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17-83e. The commissioner did not claim in opposition to the mother's claim of mootness that the case was not moot because it presented a situation that was capable of repetition, yet evaded review. Therefore, the court dismissed the appeal for mootness. The court found that the existence of an actual controversy was an essential requisite to appellate jurisdiction and that it was not the province of appellate courts to decide moot questions disconnected from the granting of actual relief or from the determination of which no practical relief could follow.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed an interlocutory appeal of an order of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Fairfield (Connecticut) that prohibited him from transferring, depleting or otherwise alienating or diminishing any property subject to forfeiture to the State upon conviction of charges of knowingly engaging in a &quot;pattern of racketeering activity&quot; in violation of the Corrupt Organizations and Racketeering Activity Act (CORA).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appeal called for a determination of the extent to which the State had the authority, in pretrial proceedings, to garnish mortgage payments that are the cash proceeds of alleged illegal racketeering activity. Defendant claimed principally that the trial court erred in not allowing him to use a portion of the forfeitable property to pay for attorney's fees he would incur defending the CORA prosecution. The State asserted that, as &quot;proceeds,&quot; the mortgage payments were forfeitable under &sect; 53-397(a) in their entirety. On appeal, the court agreed with defendant's claim for modification of the CORA lien based on the statutory exemption contained in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-398(b). The court concluded, as defendant argued, that defendant was entitled to retain a portion of the mortgage payments under &sect; 53-398(b) because, until a final judgment of forfeiture was rendered, the interest component of each mortgage payment qualified as &quot;net income or profits&quot; within the exemption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the trial court's order. On remand, the trial court was directed to determine what portion of defendant's mortgage payments constituted interest and, thus, qualified for the exemption and whether the income made available to the defendant by the statute would suffice to afford him reasonable access to counsel. The court also stated that defendant had a renewed right to further interlocutory review if dissatisfied.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed on appeal that the trial court erred in concluding that Conn. Gen.

The court ordered that the judgment of the trial court transferring defendant's case to the superior court was set aside and the case was remanded for further proceedings because the court found that the trial court erred in holding that the superior court had subject matter jurisdiction over the matter. The court held that defendant's claims of error did not implicate the subject matter jurisdiction of the superior court and that defendant failed properly to reserve them for review on appeal. The court set aside the judgment and remanded the case because the trial court mistakenly accepted defendant's plea of nolo contendere with a condition that could not be fulfilled under the court's procedures, namely the right to appeal.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendant's motion to be transferred back to the juvenile court and granted the state leave to proceed with a manslaughter charge.

On appeal, the court reviewed defendant's plea as a conditional plea and held that the trial court erred in determining that the lack of probable cause was not a dismissal, nolle, or acquittal and that the motion to transfer properly qualified as a motion to dismiss. The court reversed and held that taken together, Conn. Gen.

The court found no error with the trial court's judgment of conviction. The court determined that the prosecutor's comment violated neither state nor federal due process rights of defendant because impeachment in closing arguments by use of prearrest silence did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. The court decided that the trial court's charge to the jury regarding the right of defendant to refrain from testifying supported a conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that any improper prosecution comments did not contribute to the verdict. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting photographs of the victim's body.

Defendant's motion to suppress the statements was denied as to some of the statement and granted as to others. After a jury trial, defendant was convicted of murder. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the suppression of some of the statements was proper as the interrogations contained inducements and promises from police. The court held, however, that the discovery of the body was an intervening event, which changed the character of the interaction between police and defendant such that defendant was no longer being induced to make statements in order to reveal the location of the body. The court concluded that the statements given in response to being shown photographs of the grave site was proper admissible because it was not tainted by any of the prior, induced statements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The creditor was injured when he borrowed a riding lawnmower from the mower's owner. The owner and the creditor executed a release in which the creditor released the owner from any claims for $ 25,000. The creditor then obtained a judgment against the debtor for $ 175,000. The creditor lost the appeal. The debtor then claimed through the post-trial remedy of audita querela that the judgment should have been reduced by $ 25,000 to be paid by the owner, which had yet to be paid. The trial court ruled against the debtor and the appellate court refused to hear the claim because it was not raised at the first appeal. The court held that the debtor was not entitled to the offset. The court reasoned that once the trial and appeal were concluded, any other claims regarding what the debtor owed were barred. The post-trial relief of audita querela was only available for new defenses and the pre-trial settlement was not a new claim and it was raised at trial. Even where there was a change of interpretation regarding the application of pre-trial settlements to a judgment, the creditor was still not entitled to the writ of audita querela.</SPAN></P>

The trial court's charge to the jury clearly delineated the state's burden of proof regarding each and every element of the crime of kidnapping in the first degree, including intent, and any possible confusion engendered by the challenged portion was overcome by other instructions. The court further found that defendant could have committed the crime of kidnapping in the first degree in each case without having first committed the lesser-included offense of unlawful restraint in the first degree. Thus, there was no violation of the double jeopardy clause and no error in the trial court's imposition of consecutive sentences for each of the distinct offenses. Finally, the court found that pre-arrest, pre-arraignment, general conversations engaged in by the police and defendant in connection with voice identifications by the victims did not implicate defendant's right to counsel under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The case arose out of a municipal election for aldermen at large. The trial court concluded that it had jurisdiction to proceed &sect; 9-328, but determined that, on the merits, the petitioners could not prevail. The court remanded the case for dismissal without reaching the merits. Absent an allegation of a violation of a specific election statute,&nbsp;&sect; 9-328 only applied when an elector or a candidate claimed to have been aggrieved by any ruling of any election official in connection with an election for any municipal office or that there was a mistake in the count of votes. The outcome of the election was governed by the minority representation statute and for purposes of &sect; 9-328 it didn't matter how the municipality decided to allocate the permissible number of alderman to any one political party. The town clerk, in this case, did not make a &sect; 9-328 &quot;ruling.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant's potential alibi defense did not create a per se requirement that the State limit the times in the information more narrowly than the available evidence warranted. The court found that the fact that defendant might have offered an alibi defense was a factor to be considered by the trial court in deciding whether to grant his motion for a bill of particulars setting forth a specific date or dates of the occurrence. The court held that it was not necessary for a conviction under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21 for the State to prove the child's awareness of the act. The court concluded that it was within the jury's province to draw reasonable inferences from proven facts that it was likely that the child would waken fully or partially during the act with resultant impairment of her morals.

Defendant accompanied the victim to her home where she retrieved money to pay him. Later that night the victim awoke and found an intruder in her home.

Defendant was arrested for breach of peace. The victim went to the police station and identified defendant as the intruder, and the following day, the victim realized that defendant had also sold her the tape player. On appeal, defendant's convictions were upheld. The evidence amply supported the conclusion that defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to trial by jury. Defendant physically resisted arrest. Section 53a-167a was not unconstitutionally vague, and it limited the criminal conduct to conduct that amounted to meddling in or hampering with the activities of the police in the performance of their duties. Although defendant received his presentence investigation report late, there was no actual prejudice to defendant.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 30-102, against a restaurant that served liquor to an individual who was involved in an automobile accident that resulted in the decedent's death. The other driver's insurance company paid the estate $ 20,000. The restaurant's insurance company paid $ 20,000, but the decedent's damages exceeded $ 100,000. The administrator filed a claim for the underinsured motorist benefits under the decedent's policy. The insurance company paid basic reparations benefits but refused to pay any underinsured motorist benefits. The insurance company claimed that it was entitled to a setoff for the amounts paid under the restaurant's insurance policy. On appeal, the court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 38-175c and Conn. Agencies Regs. &sect; 38-175a-6 (d)(1) did not allow the insurer to reduce its liability for underinsured motorist coverage by the amount of money received by the insured pursuant to a dram shop policy. The setoff provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 38-175c (b)(1) did not apply to a dram shop policy because it was not classified as automobile coverage.</SPAN></P>

His clothes were seized as evidence, and he made an incriminating statement about the clothes. On review, the court found that the officer did not use any words or actions that were likely to elicit such a response. The court found that the search and seizure of the clothes was incident to a lawful arrest because the officers had probable cause to arrest him for arson based upon the information available to him from personal observation, witness statements, and the odor of gasoline on his clothes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employees sought to determine whether &sect; 5-270(b), (g) were unconstitutional because they denied to those state employees who were designated as &quot;managerial employees&quot; or &quot;managers&quot; the right to union representation and the right to bargain collectively with the State concerning the terms and conditions of their employment. The trial court entered judgment for the State. On appeal, the court found no error. Since the legislation involved did not create a suspect classification, the employees had to establish that the statutory classification was without a rational basis in order to successfully challenge it on equal protection grounds. The trial court properly found that the classification of managerial employees under &sect; 5-270 and the denial to them of collective bargaining rights under the SERA bore a rational relationship to the legitimate state end of ensuring that the State had the undivided loyalty of its top level personnel acting on its behalf. Further, the statute was not void for vagueness because the classification system, which was based upon characterizing the principal functions of employees, was sufficiently clear and explicit.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction on grounds that the court abused its discretion in permitting defendant to be tried jointly on the charges that arose from the unrelated cases. On appeal, the court reversed because the denial of severance of trials resulted in substantial injustice to defendant, and the resulting prejudice was beyond the curative power of the court's instruction. In addition, the court held that a curative instruction was not inevitably sufficient to overcome the prejudicial impact of inadmissible &quot;other crimes&quot; evidence. Finally, the court held that if the procedures used to identify a defendant were not unnecessarily suggestive, a court needed not independently analyze whether the identification was reliable.</SPAN></P>

The statements were made approximately three weeks after the crime and were not made to confidants in whom he would be expected to repose trust. There was also insufficient corroborating evidence as to the statements' truthfulness.

The trial court did not err in excluding the hearsay confession of a third party, which statement was sought to be introduced through an in-court witness. Although the trial court improperly determined that the credibility of the in-court witness was questionable, such was harmless because the trial court also determined that the hearsay statement was untrustworthy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the decision from the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Waterbury (Connecticut), which convicted him of criminally negligent homicide, failing to install smoke detectors, and violation of the state fire code. Defendant claimed that the state fire safety code's enabling act was unconstitutionally vague and that the State could not prove that he was guilty of criminally negligent homicide as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant owned a three story apartment building that caught fire when discarded smoking materials smoldered and then ignited. Eight occupants of the apartment building perished in the fire. The apartment building was not equipped with smoke detectors. Occupants who survived the fire stated that had they been alerted to the fire earlier, they would have been able to lead other occupants to safety. There was no evidence introduced at trial that a building permit was issued for defendant's building on or after October 1, 1976. Defendant was convicted of criminally negligent homicide in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-58, failing to install smoke detectors in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-292 (1985) and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-295, and violation of the state fire code. In reversing on appeal, the court held that it found error based upon a decision decided on the same date as the instant case, which held that fire safety code regulations exceeded the authority of their enabling statute where the enabling statute required that smoke detectors be installed only in those buildings for which a building permit was issued on or after October 1, 1976.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayer sought review of the assessment by defendant Commissioner of Revenue Service of a sale and use tax deficiency against the taxpayer. The Superior Court in the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford (Connecticut) reserved a question of law that was transferred to the court. The question focused on the validity of a regulation that interpreted Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-412(34).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer installed a new production line at its copper plant. It purchased the components for the new line from various sources, although all the components were purchased at the same time, and they were all required to complete the new line. The Commissioner, applying Conn. Agencies Regs. &sect; 12-426-11b(c)(1), assessed tax on all components that were not purchased from the same vendor as the basic machinery. The question posed by the lower court was whether a component part of a machine would have to constitute a machine in and of itself or be purchased in conjunction with a machine in order to be exempt from the Connecticut sales and use tax pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-412(34). The taxpayer argued that such an interpretation of the statute frustrated the legislative purpose behind the statute. The court disagreed, holding that the regulation validly limited the exemption to components purchased at the same time and from the same vendor as the basic machinery. The court reasoned that the regulation had been approved by a committee of Connecticut's legislature, was consistent with the language of the statute, and did not contravene the legislative intent behind the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff patients filed a declaratory judgment action to invalidate a regulation issue by defendant commissioner which conditioned funding for abortions on a determination by a physician that the abortion was necessary to save the patient's life. After invalidating the regulation, the Superior Court (Connecticut) entered a supplemental judgment awarding the patients attorney fees and costs. The commissioner appealed the supplemental judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state claimed that the award violated the sovereign immunity of the state, was not authorized by any statute, and was contrary to the established precedent that, in the absence of a special agreement or an applicable statute, each litigant had to bear his own legal expenses. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The court found that there was no statutory nor court-authored basis for awarding attorney fees to the patients. Neither the private attorney general nor the substantial benefit rule applied because the determination of whether a public policy was vindicated was better left to the legislature, and the award against the state would result in all taxpayers, not just those benefitting from the judgment, paying for the costs. The court held that the patients' claims for attorneys' fees incurred in obtaining necessary health related benefits erroneously denied to them by state officials fell within the jurisdiction of the claims commissioner, as set forth in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-142, to hear and determine all claims against the state. The patients' failure to pursue this administrative remedy precluded an adjudication of the constitutional claim they raised.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court set aside the supplemental judgment and remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment dismissing the claim for attorney fees and costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of murder.

Although defendant was charged by information rather than indicted by a grand jury, the court found that the crime itself predated the effective date of the information charging statute, and that his prosecution was governed retrospectively by the new statutory procedures. The court held that defendant's challenge to the statute as an ex post facto law was without merit. The court found that the change from indictment to information did not so disadvantage defendant as to require the dismissal of the charges against him. The court also held that defendant's inculpatory statements made in a noncustodial setting were not privileged under federal or state law and were therefore admissible.

The court agreed and held that &sect; 31-120, on its face, was unconstitutional. The court found that &sect; 31-120 was virtually identical to an Illinois statute declared unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court. By banning all residential picketing that did not relate to an ongoing labor dispute, the court found that &sect; 31-120, like the Illinois statute, stifled the very debate on issues of public concern that the First Amendment was intended to promote. The court found that &sect; 31-120 discriminated among speech-related activities in a public forum and that the residential privacy rationale was an insufficient justification for the content-based distinction between labor and nonlabor picketing. The court considered whether an alternate construction of &sect; 31-120 would save it from constitutional demise, but found none.</SPAN></P>

The trial court reversed and found that plaintiff had been deprived by defendant of the reasonable and proper use of her property and that there had been an unconstitutional taking without just compensation.

Therefore, defendant did not fail to take &quot;action&quot; within 65 days of the public hearing. The court concluded that the record contained substantial evidence to support defendant's reason for denying the application, and there was substantial evidence to support the denial.

On appeal, the court held, in affirming the appellate court's judgment, that the life tenant had an interest in the land sufficient to entitle her to the benefit of the automatic appeal for landowners set forth in &sect; 8-8.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The gravel company and the refuse carrier for one of the intervening towns complained that any alternate routes they were forced to travel, if their trucks were prohibited from using their normal routes through the town, were circuitous and would cost them time and money. The town contended that its ordinance was not an attempt to regulate through trucks because it applied to all trucks in excess of 15,000 pounds, whether through or intratown, and that the ordinance was a reasonable regulation to promote safety and to prevent deterioration of town streets. A review of the transcript of the hearing, however, made it clear that the principal target of the ordinance was gravel and refuse truck traffic. The court held that the ordinance was invalid because it constituted a regulation of through truck traffic, a function reserved to the state traffic commission by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-298. The ordinance, which had the effect of regulating through truck traffic by imposing a locally determined weight limit, was invalid.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that a pre-trial photographic array was not unduly suggestive because the victim observed hundreds of photos before identifying defendant and defendant failed to show that the identification procedure violated his constitutional rights.

The clerk told police that a man with a stocking on his face had pointed a &quot;bluish&quot; revolver at him. Defendant was stopped three days later with a blue revolver on the floor of his car, and a witness had seen him earlier with a brown nylon stocking mask. The clerk later identified defendant from a photo array. The photos had arrest dates that indicated that only two of the individuals had been arrested within the time frame indicated by the officer, and only one of those two fit the description the clerk provided. After summations at trial, the trial judge denied a mistrial when a juror reported that she had seen a friend of hers in the courtroom and was &quot;shocked&quot; that the friend was a friend of defendant, but that she could decide the case fairly. On appeal, the court found no error. The court held that the photo array was impermissibly suggestive, but the identification was properly admitted as reliable under the totality of the circumstances.

Some months after the withdrawal of the administrative appeal, the instant action was brought. The property owners' complaint alleged that the extension violated town ordinances; would have an adverse effect on traffic, noise, and the safety of the road; and created a dangerous nuisance. The trial court ruled that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The property owners appealed. The court held that the action was properly dismissed under Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court held that &sect; 7-148(c)(7)(H)(iv), which provided for municipal regulation of peddlers, gave the town the authority to enact the ordinance.

Stat.&nbsp;&sect; 7-148(c)(7)(H)(iv) permitted municipalities only to regulate street vending, not to prohibit it altogether. However, the court held that the ordinance was regulatory in nature because it did not forbid the drivers from vending their products from non-motorized vehicles. The ordinance was a reasonable exercise of police power, because it was rationally related to the town's concern for public safety. The ordinance did not violate due process or equal protection because it bore a reasonable relationship to a proper legislative purpose in a manner that was neither arbitrary nor discriminatory. The ordinance did not require compelling governmental interest because the privilege of engaging in business was not a fundamental right. Finally, the ordinance did not interfere with interstate commerce because it treated out-of-state sellers on the same basis as local sellers and any minimal interference was outweighed by public interest in safety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of aiding and abetting a burglary in the third degree and of larceny in the second degree in the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Haven, Geographical Area Number Six (Connecticut). He appealed and contended (1) that it was error to deny a motion to suppress evidence, (2) that the information lacked specificity and had not given him adequate notice of the charge, and (3) that the evidence was insufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant alleged the erroneous denial of his motion to suppress a mink cape obtained at his apartment, because the warrant allegedly lacked probable cause. However, when the court considered the case in light of all factors, it was evident that any minimal taint stemming from the allegedly illegal search was sufficiently purged. He also claimed that the count of the information charging him with larceny was constitutionally infirm because it failed to specify the date on which he supposedly committed the offense. The language &quot;on or after&quot; was a technical error, but it was never seriously challenged. Moreover, the language had not prejudiced defendant in the preparation of his defense, as he chose not to testify or to present any evidence. He was sufficiently informed of the nature of the crime with which he was charged. Defendant also contended that the evidence introduced at trial was insufficient to establish his guilt on both counts beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the court held that the evidence implicating defendant, while certainly not overwhelming, when considered in the light most favorable to the state was in fact sufficient to support the jury's verdict of guilty.</SPAN></P>
