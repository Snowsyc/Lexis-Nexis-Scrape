</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appeal from criminal conviction and 10-year term of imprisonment in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Cumberland County, following defendant's plea of guilty, and imposition of an 8 1/2 -year parole ineligibility term with a 3-year term of parole supervision pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:43-7.2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following charges of felony murder, robbery and burglary, defendant pleaded guilty to the amended offense of reckless manslaughter. The trial court imposed a 10-year prison term, and an 8 1/2 -year parole ineligibility term with a 3-year term of parole supervision, pursuant to the No Early Release Act (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:43-7.2. On appeal, defendant argued that the Act's absence of a degree of culpability required courts to insert &quot;knowingly&quot; as the degree of culpability required to apply the Act, and second-degree reckless manslaughter was not a &quot;violent crime&quot; within the Act's intendment. The court affirmed, holding first that the plain language of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:2-2c(3), creating the need to impute the &quot;knowingly&quot; culpability standard, only applied to statutes defining offenses. Second, the plain language of the Act, defining a violent crime as one in which the actor caused death, clearly applied to reckless manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction affirmed, because the plain language of the act, creating the need to impute the &quot;knowingly&quot; culpability standard, only applied to statutes defining offenses, and clearly applied to reckless manslaughter. The parole ineligibility did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City of Camden sought a declaratory judgment that a provision of the New Jersey General Appropriations Act for 1998-1999, L. 1998, c. 45 was unconstitutional. The Act authorized the Local Finance Board (Board) to create a financial review board to approve, implement and enforce a financial plan for the City of Camden. The City contended the authorization to create the financial review board violated the New Jersey Constitution's mandates that legislative acts have a single object and that the Legislature could not pass special laws regulating the internal affairs of municipalities. The court held that the issues raised were moot. Not only had the time for effective supervision of the 1998-99 fiscal year long passed, but Camden had agreed to continue fiscal supervision by its financial review board as part of its new distressed city aid from the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appeal dismissed as moot due to passing of time for effective supervision of appellant city's 1998-99 fiscal year and it had agreed to continue fiscal supervision by its financial review board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant township sought review of a decision of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Middlesex County which granted summary judgment to plaintiff associations who challenged appellant's water detention basin maintenance ordinance as exceeding appellant's authority under the state's Municipal Land Use Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55D-53.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three associations of developers challenged appellant's ordinance requiring maintenance of water detention basins, contending the ordinance exceeded appellant's municipal authority under the Municipal Land Use Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55D-53, and was unconstitutional. Appellant moved for summary judgment, contending plaintiffs lacked standing, in addition to untimely filing. The trial judge disqualified himself due to a conflict of interest, sent the standing issue to another judge, then subsequently heard the substantive issues, declaring the ordinance unlawful on its face. Appellant appealed. The court reversed and remanded because a disqualification required the judge step aside from all issues in the case; the court was not relieved of its duty to make findings if a standing issue was suspect, and the trial court's decision on the substantive issue was inadequate for the court's review and must be addressed on remand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, convicted of first-degree robbery and second-degree possession of firearm with intent to use it unlawfully against a person, was sentenced under the No Early Release Act, N.J.

Defendant appealed, contending his rights were violated because his peremptory challenges were not allowed and his sentence violated constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment. The court affirmed defendant's conviction but remanded for re-sentencing on the second-degree conviction. The court held that a defendant could not make race-based juror challenges. The court refused to consider the constitutional issue since it was not raised at trial. Finally, the court remanded the second-degree conviction for re-sentencing because defendant's conviction of a purely possessive crime did not meet statutory definition of violent criminal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed from the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Warren County, which incorporated prior orders for summary judgment and an order denying reconsideration. These orders were entered in favor of defendants relieving them from any further obligation to deliver solid waste to the incinerator or to pay for failing to deliver it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By an agreement made pursuant to state waste regulations, defendants, county and hauler, promised to deliver a set amount of waste to plaintiff's incinerator and to pay for the processing of that amount of waste, whether delivered or not. After federal cases held that such regulations and agreements were unconstitutional as per se discrimination, the defendants ceased deliveries and payments. In the subsequent suit, the trial court granted summary judgment for defendants, declaring the contract was unenforceable as a matter of law. On appeal, plaintiffs argued that there were material facts in dispute, that the court misinterpreted or misapplied the governing law, and that the defendant hauler, who was not an original signatory to the agreement but was party to a settlement agreement, was still liable. The court held that, since the agreement was retroactively void and unenforceable, and the settlement agreement was vacated, the defendants could not be liable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment affirmed as to enforceability of contract between plaintiffs and defendants; remanded to determine equitable allocation of financial burden, and to join another county as a party.</SPAN></P>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) purported to act under authority of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27:7-94, which authorizes such a revocation provided that suitable &quot;alternative access&quot; is available. The DOT claimed the existing access did not meet current access standards and that it provided suitable alternative access. Petitioner claimed, however, that the proposed alternative access was unsuitable and did not comply with statutory standards. The court applied the five elements which N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27:7-94c(1) incorporates that must be satisfied in order for a proposed new access plan to constitute &quot;reasonable alternative access,&quot; and concluded that with respect to each of those five elements, there was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the DOT had met its burden.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; while petitioner's alternative plan of access should have been considered, refusal to do so was not prejudicial error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand, the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Morris County, conducted a plenary hearing to determine that defendants' garbage collection ordinance violated plaintiff's equal protection rights because the classification scheme bore no rational relationship to any legitimate state interest. However, the trial court found plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case for damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Both sides appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant town passed a garbage collection ordinance providing free collection service to all residential dwellings of three or less units as well as certain condominium developments. As a multi-family dwelling of four or more units, plaintiff's apartment complex did not receive such service. Claiming the ordinance violated its constitutional rights to due process and equal protection, plaintiff sought the same garbage collection service provided to all other residents as well as compensatory damages and attorney fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1988. After plenary hearing, the trial court reaffirmed a prior determination that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it was not rationally related to a legitimate state interest. However, the trial court denied plaintiff's demand for damages under &sect; 1983 and counsel fees under &sect; 1988, and parties appealed. Finding plaintiff proved the classification lacked any rational basis, the court struck the ordinance. Moreover, defendants' good faith in enacting and enforcing ordinance was no defense to plaintiff's &sect; 1983 claim for damages. Thus, the court remanded to determine if plaintiff had a viable claim for damages and counsel fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's holding that defendants' garbage collection ordinance violated plaintiff's equal protection rights because the classification scheme was not rationally related to a legitimate state interest, but reversed its holding that plaintiff failed to state a prima facie civil rights claim for deprivation of constitutional rights and therefore remanded for a hearing on damages and counsel fees under federal law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees owned beachfront condominiums with an ocean view. Appellant city attempted to purchase an easement from appellees, and they refused. After a hearing on the matter, commissioners appointed to appraise the value of the easement taken by appellant city issued a report and valued the easement at $ 1. A court proceeding ensued and the trial court held in favor of appellees. The trial court held that the easement completely blocked appellants' view of the ocean and that appellees were entitled to severance damages based on this obstructed view. The city appealed and the court reviewed all expert testimony. The court concluded that although appellees' expert did not state the specific date of the taking, his evidence was temporally relevant to that date, and was stated with sufficient particularity to support a compensable loss of beach view and access by appellees. The court affirmed the trial court's award, holding that there was evidence to support the conclusion that appellees lost their ocean view, beach access, and privacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state appealed a decision from the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Atlantic County, ruling that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:25-17 to -33, outlawing assault weapons, was unconstitutionally vague. Defendant cross-appealed the denial of his application to the Pretrial Intervention Program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of a domestic violence restraining order, defendant was required to turn over all of his weapons to the police. One of the weapons was an assault rifle with a barrel labeled &quot;Universal M1 autoloading carbine.&quot; The trial court found that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;2C:39-1w(1) listing &quot;M1 carbine type&quot; as an assault weapon was unconstitutionally vague, both facially and as applied. On appeal, the court ruled that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied as the stamp on the rifle gave sufficient notice to defendant that the gun had the basic design proscribed by the statute. On the cross-appeal, defendant challenged the decision by the prosecutor to deny his application for admission to the Pretrial Intervention (PTI) program. In affirming the decision the court held that judicial review of prosecutorial decisions on diversion into PTI was available to check only the most egregious examples of injustice and unfairness. The court found no unfairness as rejection was based on the large number of weapons and the illegal rifle possessed by defendant and the potential for violence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff hunting protestors appealed from the judgment of the Hudson County Superior Court (New Jersey) dismissing their complaint for declaratory relief and ruling that the Hunter Harassment Statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:7A-1 et seq., was not facially overbroad, vague, or impermissibly content-based, in violation of plaintiffs rights under U.S. Const. amend. I, and did not violate their equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff hunting protestors brought a declaratory judgment action challenging the facial constitutionality of the Hunter Harassment Statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:7A-1 et seq., claiming, inter alia, that it violated hunting opponents' rights to free speech and equal protection, under U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV. Upon cross-motions for summary judgment, the complaint was dismissed and plaintiffs appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that the statute was not a impermissible content-based restriction of anti-hunting speech; rather, by its terms, it plainly regulated conduct that was not sufficiently expressive to constitute speech. The statute aimed only to proscribe the hindering of a person engaged in the lawful taking of wildlife by hunting and it was not intended to favor pro-hunting advocates to the exclusion of the anti-hunting viewpoint. The terms of the statute were not vague, unclear, or imprecise and there was no real and substantial deterrent effect on legitimate expression. Moreover, the statute was not overbroad; it applied only in limited areas and only where the actor had the wrongful intent to interfere with the lawful taking of wildlife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment dismissing the challenge to the statute was affirmed because the statute did not regulate speech, but prohibited the non-expressive conduct of physically interfering with hunters with the intent of interfering with the lawful taking of wildlife; it was not substantially overbroad and its terms were sufficiently clear and precise; and it did not impermissibly endorse the viewpoint of hunters at the expense of protesters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Union County, of aggravated manslaughter and possession of a handgun without a permit. He petitioned for post-conviction relief, asserting that the prosecutor had concealed evidence of the victim's prior criminal conviction for murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an unsuccessful appeal of his conviction for manslaughter and possession of a handgun without a permit, defendant learned that his victim had a prior murder conviction. He petitioned for post-conviction relief, and contended that the prosecutor had concealed the conviction; he asserted alternatively that if the prosecution had provided the defense with the evidence, his trial attorney was derelict in failing to use it to bolster defendant's claim of self-defense. At trial the prosecution characterized the victim as a nonviolent, peaceful individual, and the defense unsuccessfully attempted to prove that the victim had a violent and aggressive personality. The victim's conviction for a violent crime was admissible to show that he was the aggressor in the context of a claim of self-defense; and thus the victim's prior murder conviction was potentially admissible to establish his violent character and his conduct on the date of the killing. Therefore, the matter was remanded for consideration of defendant's alternative claims of unconstitutional concealment of exculpatory evidence by the prosecution or ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An order denying defendant's petition for post-conviction relief was reversed and the matter was remanded, where evidence of the victim's prior murder conviction was either concealed by the prosecution or defendant's counsel failed to use the conviction to bolster defendant's claim of self-defense, and defendant was convicted of manslaughter. The victim's conviction was potentially admissible to show he had a violent and aggressive personality.</SPAN></P>

The tax court ruled that hazardous waste transporter registration fees, authorized under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1E-18, violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3.</SPAN></P>

The tax court had ruled that the hazardous waste transporter registration fees adopted by defendant, New Jersey, to register and track vehicles engaged in the collection or delivery of hazardous waste in the state constituted a burden upon interstate commerce under a dormant Commerce Clause analysis. The court rejected as premature, and probably unnecessary, the tax court's grant of summary judgment. The court found that state courts had jurisdiction to make separate and varying rulings as to the commerce impact of the hazardous waste hauling fees of their respective states. But a final judgment, and particularly summary judgment, should not issue in New Jersey absent critical input from the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT). The USDOT had been charged by Congress with administration of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 5101-5127, to promote uniformity and to ensure fairness of hazardous waste hauling fees imposed by the respective states.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Essex County, judgment disallowing projected lost profits and vacating punitive damage award. Plaintiff alleged error in allowing defendant telephone company to argue they had not committed fraud and by prohibiting jury from considering projected lost profits. Defendants cross-appealed alleging judicial estoppel barred a fraud claim and insufficient evidence for punitive damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiff's suit against defendants, telephone company and its employee, for fraudulent inducement to enter into a contract, plaintiff sought to recover compensatory damages, projected lost profits, and punitive damages. Compensatory damages were awarded. Consideration of projected lost profits was disallowed, because plaintiff's proof was too speculative to permit consideration by a jury. Evidence was sufficient to show that repeated acts of defendant employee were accompanied by wanton and willful disregard of plaintiff's right to profit from its proprietary information and from efforts of its employees. Therefore, punitive damages were warranted. At the first trial, the punitive damage award was so disproportionate to the amount of actual harm as to shock the court's conscience. Thus, granting a new trial to determine punitive damages was not a miscarriage of justice. The second trial was rendered unfair because of confusion as to what was to be tried. The defendant argued improper points for a trial on punitive damages only. Therefore, plaintiff was entitled to a new trial, if it so chose, but that trial would have to address plaintiff's right to punitive damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment for compensatory and punitive damages to plaintiff was affirmed, but the cause was remanded to permit plaintiff to exercise its right to a new trial on punitive damages should it so choose. Evidence was sufficient to show fraud by defendant employee in his repeated acts with wanton and willful disregard of plaintiff's right to profits. The trial on punitive damages was rendered unfair because of confusion as to what was to be tried.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a trial by jury, defendant was convicted in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Sussex County, of 44 theft and sales tax crimes of the second, third, and fourth degree, all arising out of his operation of an automobile dealership. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant purchased a financially distress Chrysler dealership. He was inexperienced in operating a car dealership and was undercapitalized and suffered immediate cash flow problems. Before defendant left and ceased doing business, he failed to pay off the liens and to obtain properly executed certificates of title with evidence of satisfaction of the debt for several buyers of new or used cars each traded in cars that had outstanding liens held by financial institutions. There were also problems with extended warranties. A jury convicted defendant of theft and sales tax crimes. The court reversed and remanded. For criminal liability to attach to the acts or course of conduct of a businessman, who was on the brink of insolvency, there must be criminal intent and culpability as defined by the criminal statutes. The court found that the jury was not appraised of the distinction between civil and criminal concepts and, therefore, had insufficient guidance in the determinations required of it. The court then detailed the deficiencies in the instructions as to each set of related charges against defendant. It also discussed certain erroneous and prejudicial evidentiary rulings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of convictions was reversed and the case remanded for the dismissal of six counts of the indictment and for retrial of all remaining counts. There was substantial error in the charge to the jury, coupled with erroneous evidential rulings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">These consolidated appeals addressed the coordinated actions of defendant county and plaintiff utilities authority to assure repayment of debt issued by plaintiff. The ability of plaintiff to meet its debt obligations was jeopardized by the invalidation of the state imposed solid waste management plan and the consequent drop in plaintiff's revenue. A suit was filed that sought to declare defendant's refunding bond deficiency agreement with plaintiff unconstitutional. Plaintiffs appealed after the trial court transferred the entirely of the consolidated cases pursuant to N.J. Ct. R. 1:13-4(a). The court found that such transfer was proper. Further, the court found that the environmental investment charge, an essential element of plaintiffs' financial remediation plan, and the deficiency agreement were authorized by the Municipal and County Utilities Authorities Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:14B-1 to -69. Finally, the court concluded that the deficiency agreement, by which defendants agreed to guarantee the payment of unsecured revenue bonds issued by plaintiffs, was a constitutional use of public funds for a private purpose. Accordingly, the order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Despite the closure, defendants went surfboarding and were subsequently convicted of creating a physically dangerous condition, obstructing the administration of law, violating an ordinance permitting the closure of beaches, and violating an ordinance prohibiting bathing under certain conditions. Defendants appealed, and the court affirmed. The court disagreed with defendants' contention that the municipal court lacked jurisdiction to hear their case. The municipal court was granted territorial and subject matter jurisdiction over cases arising with regard to premises or property located partly in and partly outside the municipality. The court further held that the municipal ordinances under which defendants were convicted were not unconstitutionally vague. An ordinance was facially vague only if there was no conduct that it proscribed with sufficient certainty. An ordinance was vague as applied if it did not clearly prohibit the conduct on which the particular charges were based. Neither form of vagueness was found here.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff received a franchise for the disposal of solid waste from a county located within defendant state. Construction of the facility was financed through bonds issued by the county pollution control financing authority (PCFA). As a result of a district court decision striking down the defendant's waste control policy, resource recovery facilities were no longer guaranteed to receive a certain quantity of waste. Plaintiff brought suit to restrain the PCFA from opening new bids for the operation of the facility. PCFA and the county asserted cross claims against defendant seeking indemnification for any loss they might incur. The trial court reserved defendant's motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court reversed the decision. Plaintiff argued that a contractual relationship between itself and the defendant was created when plaintiff was granted the franchise. The court disagreed and held that, although the defendant's policy was constitutionally flawed, it did not create an enforceable contractual right for the litigants. Moreover, the court reasoned that the parties must approach the legislative and executive branches of government to obtain relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State Board of Education granted charters to three respondent schools. Appellant school districts challenged the decision, various aspects of the Charter School Program Act of 1995, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:36A-1 to -18, and its application in practice. Appellants argued that the charter school applications failed to meet the informational requirements of the Act or regulations. Two of the schools had already opened; the third would open in the next school year. For the schools that had already opened, the court considered the current charter school students and found purely technical defects in the application did not justify overturning the charter at this late date. Thus, the court found reliance on the post-application site-designation regulation in this start-up context was harmless, not reversible error, and respondents substantially complied. Appellants further argued that the Charter School Program Act was unconstitutional because it breached the equal protection rights of parents and students in the existing school districts, to the advantage of the charter schools. The court rejected this argument and affirmed the decision below.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee worked as a police officer for defendant township until disability forced him to retire. In a resolution passed by defendant, plaintiff was given his full salary, disability benefits, accrued vacation and sick time, and health benefits. After defendant failed to pay disability benefits, plaintiff filed suit. Plaintiff was awarded disability benefits at trial. On appeal, the court held that the resolution was unenforceable and that the award was nevertheless excessive. On the appeal here, the court affirmed. The collective bargaining agreement which permitted receipt of disability benefits in excess of the statutory maximum level was unenforceable because statutes covering public employee benefits could not be contravened by negotiated agreement. Further, application of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:14-154, which limited the compensation for permanent disability was not unconstitutional as applied to plaintiff. The statute did not violate the Contracts Clause because it did not substantially impair a contractual relationship. The statute also did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because it was rationally related to a legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversing award of disability benefits to plaintiff employee was affirmed because the collective bargaining agreement giving plaintiff benefits in excess of the statutory maximum was unenforceable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of the decision of the Department of Banking and Insurance (New Jersey), which determined that a special purpose apportionment authorized under N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent commissioner issued notices of assessment against appellant surplus lines insurers (SLI) pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 17:1C-19 - 17:1C-32. Appellants claimed they had insufficient connections with New Jersey to qualify as insurers doing business in New Jersey and that, therefore, application of the act was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the decision upholding the constitutionality of the act. SLI insured risks, adjusted claims, and were amenable to suit in New Jersey. Those factors indicated a presence in New Jersey related to the business of insurance. The taxation of SLI did not violate their right to substantive due process. SLI ability to insure risks in New Jersey and the Department of Banking and Insurance's expenses in the discharge of oversight responsibilities satisfied the constitutional test for due process limits on a state's power to tax out of state corporations. New Jersey's purpose for the tax, to obtain reimbursement for the cost of regulatory oversight of SLI, was a legitimate state interest and did not violate equal protection. The department was not constrained by the Commerce Clause in regulating out of state insurers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's decision that a statute imposing a special purpose apportionment on surplus line insurers was constitutional. The court found that surplus line insurers had sufficient connections with New Jersey to warrant application of the statute because they insured risks within the state. For the same reason, the court held that the statute did not violate appellants' right to substantive due process.</SPAN></P>

Defendants later moved to dismiss for plaintiff's failure to comply with the Affidavit of Merit Statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat.

On appeal, the court found that the circumstances of the case, particularly the delay by defendants in providing decipherable records, were so extraordinary that a dismissal without prejudice before the statute of limitations ran would have been necessary, because plaintiffs did not have the opportunity to present evidence on the issue of such extraordinary circumstances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant municipality filed suit against respondent railroad corporation, seeking injunctive relief and damages for public nuisance. Appellant claimed that respondent's activities along its right-of-way and side tracks annoyed adjacent citizens and damaged their properties. Respondent moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motion, finding the action precluded by principles of federal preemption. On appeal, the trial court's judgment was affirmed as modified. The court on appeal held that the trial court was correct in finding that federal preemption barred litigating the claim in state court. The Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 10501(a, b), expressly granted exclusive regulatory control over railroad transportation matters to the Surface Transportation Board. However, it was within the purview of the federal authorities to allow state intervention, and thus if appellant could persuade the federal authorities to permit that, it could refile its claim without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

Taking into account defendant's nine prior convictions, the trial court sentenced him to prison for 18 months. Defendant argued that the anti-stalking statute was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague, and that his motion for acquittal should have been granted because evidence was insufficient to support verdict.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners appealed a trial-level order from the Superior Court of New Jersey, which dismissed, upon motion, plaintiff's complaint to challenge a sewer construction assessment imposed by defendant township because plaintiffs failed to provide notice to defendant's tax collector and clerk within 30 days of the adoption of the sewer assessment, as required by N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As an initial matter, the court noted that it was undisputed that the clerk and tax collector both had been served with a copy of the complaint more than 30 days after the resolution had been adopted. The court then rejected plaintiff property owners' contention that N.J. Ct. R. 4:69, which governed prerogative writs, rather than N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:56-54, controlled plaintiffs' challenge to the validity of defendant township's sewer assessment. The court found that contrary to plaintiffs' assertion, the statute setting forth the procedures for appealing assessments was dispositive, despite the state supreme court's constitutional power to adopt rules governing practice and procedure, because no question of fundamental constitutional rights had been raised by the complaint. The court held that the allegations of plaintiffs' complaint, which merely related that by reason of the inclusion of their property, the assessments were undue or excessive, were the proper subject of inquiry under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:56-54. The court affirmed, concluding that dismissal was appropriate where plaintiffs failed to institute their proceedings within the time limited by the statute.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the injunction and dismissed plaintiffs' verified amended complaint. The court affirmed and held that dismissal of plaintiffs' amended complaint was proper as the construction of the proposed community/educational facility did not violate N.J. Stat.

The court ruled that the trial court properly considered defendants' motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment pursuant to N.J. Ct.

Petitioner asserted that public disclosure of the order caused managed health care organizations to refuse petitioner panel status, thereby interfering with his right to pursue his livelihood. Petitioner asked the court to order the board to modify or expunge the order. Expungement was a legislatively authorized remedy, expressly limited to certain prescribed criminal, quasi-criminal, juvenile and other enumerated offenses. N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:52-2 to -6. In interpreting the breadth of the expungement remedy, the court concluded that the statute expressly applied only to criminal charges. The disposition of the board was affirmed because expungement power did not extend to licensing agencies. Because the expungement power did not extend to licensing agencies, the relief sought by petitioner was beyond the power of the board to grant.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed the lower court's judgment and argued that the trial court erred in admitting hearsay testimony and in consolidating his prosecution of complainant with complainant's prosecution of him and that the lower court erred in refusing review of the forfeiture order. The court affirmed and ruled that the testimony recounting complainant's report of defendant's assault was admissible as an excited utterance, that defendant consented to the consolidation, and that the consolidated trial was not fundamentally unfair. The court also ruled that forfeiture of office was a mandatory requirement separate from the sentence, designed to effect an important public purpose apart from punishment for an offense, and that, under N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for and convicted of possession of heroin and tampering with evidence. He appealed the judgment of conviction, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his suppression motion where the search was unlawful and erred in failing to dismiss the charges of evidence tampering. In affirming defendant's conviction of drug possession, the court concluded that the search was unlawful where the police had an objectively reasonable basis to travel to the location where an unknown informant indicated that they would find an armed person and to stop and frisk defendant when his appearance matched the description provided by the informant. Defendant's failure to promptly respond to officer's command to take his hand out of his pocket provided a reasonable basis for the police officers to direct him to get down on the ground so that they could conduct a search for weapons without undue danger to themselves. In reversing defendant's conviction of tampering with evidence, however, the court concluded that the act of discarding contraband upon the approach of police did not constitute evidence tampering.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant programs company contracted to purchase property from defendant property sellers which they planned to convert into group home for emotionally disturbed teenagers. After initially approving the plan, plaintiff city and intervenor neighbors and parents sought to terminate the project. Defendant property seller and programs company countered alleging violations of the Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3601 et seq., and the Law Against Discrimination (LAD), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10:5-1 to -42. The trial court found FHAA and LAD violations, awarded declaratory and injunctive relief and damages to defendant property seller. Defendant property seller appealed contending improper refusal to consider the damages he incurred during period between trial conclusion and the court's decision. Both defendant property sellers challenged the denial of counsel fees which defendant program company was awarded. The court concluded that defendant property seller was entitled to damages he sustained not only to the time of trial but also to the time of the court's decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff demonstrator brought an action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983 and 1985(3) against defendant municipality based on his arrest at a Republican political rally. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed. Plaintiff offered no proof to support allegations that defendant had a municipal policy to suppress the beliefs of Democrats. His allegations that the police chief created policy on how to handle criminal complaints also failed. The power to effect arrests resided in the county prosecutor and neither the police chief nor defendant had the final policymaking authority with respect to such procedures. Whether the police chief willfully or negligently misapplied county policy was an issue that related to his individual liability, not defendant's. Plaintiff's failure to train theory likewise failed, because plaintiff failed to point to one incident in which Democrats were the targets of official misconduct. There was no need to analyze the particulars of plaintiff's &sect; 1985(3) claim, because plaintiff's failure to demonstrate a municipal policy in the first instance barred his recovery under both &sect; 1983 and &sect; 1985(3).</SPAN></P>

Defendant did not have final policymaking authority as to effecting arrests, and thus plaintiff could not show that defendant's policy was the moving force of any constitutional violation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee widow's husband was killed in the course of his employment with appellant employer, and she was awarded widow-dependency benefits, as provided in N.J.

The hearing judge held that appellee was entitled to receive dependency benefits and appellant sought review. The court affirmed, because appellant had a vested right to the dependency benefits, and applying the amendment to existing claims constituted, at most, secondary retroactivity, because it only applied to the future receipt of benefits as a result of the elimination of the credit. The court concluded that appellee had only a contingent right to the credit that did not vest until appellee's income was actually obtained from employment on each occasion when the statute was in effect, therefore no constitutional infirmity existed in the secondarily retroactive application of the amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school board sought review from a scope of negotiation determination by the Public Employment Relations Commission (New Jersey), which decided that a proposed cap on payments for unused paid sick leave was an illegal inducement to early retirement and, thus, non-negotiable, and that respondent union did not knowingly bargain away accrued sick leave compensation by consenting in advance to be bound by the recommendations of a factfinder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school board and respondent union were at an impasse in contract negotiations and were referred to a factfinder to make a recommendation. Respondent agreed to be bound to the decision. The factfinder proposed a retroactive cap on accumulated unused sick leave payable on retirement to employees. The issue of accumulated sick leave payments was not at issue in negotiations. The Public Employment Relations Commission (commission) decided that a proposed cap was an illegal inducement to early retirement and was non-negotiable. The commission further determined that respondent did not knowingly bargain away accrued sick leave compensation by consenting in advance to be bound by the recommendations of a factfinder. The court affirmed the decision of the commission because appellant and respondent could not divest employees of accumulated sick leave compensation without a knowing and intentional waiver by the employees affected. The court also held that respondent did not bargain away the sick leave by consenting to the factfinder's decision in advance where the retroactive cap was first conceived by the factfinder and had never been proposed by either of the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision prohibiting a cap on the payment of accrued sick leave of employees upon retirement because appellant school board and respondent union could not adopt a policy that divested employees of accumulated sick leave compensation absent a knowing and intentional waiver by the persons adversely affected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision from the Superior Court of New Jersey, Middlesex County, which convicted defendant pursuant to the former version of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-5(b)(2) of second-degree possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and related drug charges. The trial court imposed an extended term of 20 years with a 10-year period of parole ineligibility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested following a surveillance operation where he was suspected of possessing cocaine for distribution. Defendant was convicted of second-degree possession with the intent to distribute one-half ounce or more of cocaine, pursuant to the prior version of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-5(b)(2) and other drug-related crimes. The trial court imposed an extended term of 20 years with a 10-year period of parole ineligibility. The appellate court affirmed the conviction but remanded for resentencing. N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-5(b)(2) was not unconstitutionally vague. The statute clearly stated that the weight included adulterants and dilutants, not just the weight of the cocaine itself. The trial court did not state its reasons for resentencing defendant to 20 years when the presumptive sentence for a third-degree extended sentence was 15 years under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:44-1(f)(1)(b) nor did it state its reasons for the parole ineligibility. Because of the trial court's inadequate explanation for its sentences, the cause was remanded.</SPAN></P>

The trial court awarded summary judgment to defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part, finding that plaintiff's interpretation of &sect; 54:4-3.140 was not unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a group of residents, taxpayers, and interested associations, filed an action against defendants, a city, a mayor, a city council, and a resort corporation, alleging that improper actions were taken in connection with a redevelopment area. Defendants moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the trial court did not err in failing to conclude that defendant city unconstitutionally donated public land to defendant resort corporation. The court further found that certain contingencies in the redevelopment agreement did not make it illusory. Finally, the court found no merit to plaintiffs' contentions that the trial judge inappropriately applied the relevant standard in granting summary judgment to defendants. However, the court did modify the redevelopment agreement, finding that one of its sections violated a statute. In all other respects, the trial court's decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment from the Superior Court, Ocean County (New Jersey), which convicted him of driving under the influence of alcohol and careless driving. Defendant contended that the serum alcohol test used against him was unreliable and inadmissible. Further, defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for careless driving.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a collision with oncoming traffic and taken to a hospital. A police officer noticed alcohol on defendant's breath and asked him to take a blood alcohol test. Defendant agreed and the test indicated a serum alcohol level of 149 milligrams, the equivalent of a blood alcohol level of .128 percent. Based on the results of the test, defendant was found guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol and careless driving. On appeal, the law division tried the case de novo, again finding defendant guilty. Defendant sought additional review, contending that the results of the blood serum test were unreliable and inadmissible. However, the court found no basis for ruling that the serum test was inadmissible, given the ample evidence of the test's reliability. However, the court agreed that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of careless driving. The court held that due to the quasi-criminal nature of the proceedings, the state was required to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Absent any specific evidence that defendant was actually careless, the court held that he could not be convicted of careless driving.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol was affirmed because the reliability of the results of a serum alcohol test were not sufficiently in doubt as to render them inadmissible. But, absent specific evidence of defendant's carelessness, the state could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty of careless driving; thus, that conviction was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff scoutmaster sought review of a decision from the Superior Court of New Jersey, Monmouth County, that granted summary judgment to defendants, Boy Scouts of America and the local boy scout council, after plaintiff was expelled from his position as an assistant scoutmaster after publicly declaring he was a homosexual.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff scoutmaster was expelled from his position with defendant local boy scout council after publicly declaring his homosexual status. He was expelled from defendant Boy Scouts of America (BSA) because of its policy excluding avowed homosexuals from membership in its organization. Plaintiff filed a complaint in the superior court, alleging his expulsion violated the New Jersey laws against discrimination (LAD) as well as certain common law rights. Summary judgment was granted to defendants wherein the superior court stated plaintiff had no cause of action under the LAD because defendant BSA was not a place of public accommodation, was a distinctly private organization, and was, thus, excluded from the LAD. Upon review, the court held that the LAD rendered unlawful certain discriminations, and its goal was nothing less than the eradication of the cancer of discrimination. Further, defendant BSA, and its local councils were places of public accommodation dependent upon the broad-based participation of members of the general public and as such were not entitled to LAD exclusion. The judgment of the superior court was reversed, and the cause was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a trial, the tax court reduced the property tax assessment on certain land owned by respondent property owners. Appellant municipality sought review, contending that the underlying assessments were improperly calculated, and that the Freeze Act judgment was entered prematurely. Affirming the tax court's judgment, the court held that the discounted cash flow analysis using an absorption discount as one factor in the calculation of value was appropriate. The court further held that appellant's attempt to appeal this method of valuation after embracing it at trial violated the doctrine of judicial estoppel. The court concluded that there was no reason to believe that the legislature intended the Freeze Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:51A-8, to apply to a tax court determination that remained on appeal, but not to a county board of taxation determination that was on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Superior Court of Camden County (New Jersey), which convicted him of murder and felony murder, N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a death penalty case, defendant and an accomplice kidnapped a young mother and her 4-year-old son, then raped and murdered the mother. Defendant was convicted of murder and felony murder, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3a, first- and second-degree kidnapping, &sect; 2C:13-1b(1)(2), conspiracy to commit robbery, &sect; 2C:5-2, first-degree robbery, &sect; 2C:15-1, possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose and unlawful possession of a weapon, &sect; 2C:39, and first-degree aggravated sexual assault, &sect; 2C:14-2a(3). The court affirmed, holding that under &sect; 2C:14-2a(3), proof of one or more of the predicate crimes was all that was necessary to establish the absence of &quot;affirmative and freely given permission.&quot; The court also held that &sect; 2C:14-2a required proof that a rape-murder victim be alive at the time the assaultive behavior began but not at the time of penetration. The court further held that in a capital murder case, felony murder must be submitted to the jury if rationally supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions because proof of the homicide established the sexual assault charge, the death of defendant's rape-murder victim prior to penetration did not necessarily preclude a rape conviction, and felony murder was required to be charged where it was rationally based on the evidence and was the basis for an alternative form of murder that was noncapital.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, noting that the rule was that if a law was so vague that persons of common intelligence must guess at its meaning, it would be considered void for vagueness. The court noted that the Supreme Court of New Jersey had defined the term &quot;practice of law&quot; and it therefore could not be considered facially vague, and also found that the statute clearly proscribed certain conduct and therefore was not vague as applied. The court found that the drafting of pleadings and other legal documents did constitute the practice of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Bergen County, which adjudicated him delinquent for possessing an imitation controlled dangerous substance as criminalized by N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An undercover police officer arranged to purchase LSD from a juvenile. After negotiating the sale, three juveniles were arrested, including appellant. After the arrest, a search of the car in which the juveniles were riding yielded two plastic-wrapped sheets of blotter paper, each perforated into 100 sections with each section imprinted with black and white smiley faces. It is undisputed that the sheets were styled and packaged in a traditional manner used to transfer LSD. Initially, the juveniles were charged with possession with intent to distribute and distribution. After the blotter paper sections tested negative for LSD, the state amended its complaint and charged appellant with possession of an imitation controlled substance as criminalized by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-11. The trial court concluded that the sheets of blotter paper fell within the intendment of the statute, and adjudicated appellant delinquent. In affirming the lower court, the court concluded that the statutory plain language criminalized the possession of a substance that was designed to replicate LSD.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order adjudicating appellant delinquent. The court ruled that the visual nature of the packaged sheets engendered circumstances designed to lead a reasonable person to believe that the sheets contained LSD. Those circumstances, compounded with the uniqueness of the drug, satisfied the court that appellant possessed an imitation substance criminalized by statute.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that although there was no place within appellant's borders that would satisfy &sect; 2C:34-7, there may have been ample alternative channels for communication in nearby communities. Because &sect; 2C:34-7 was a state statute, there was no need to limit the inquiry to the appellant's borders.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former wife sought review of portions of the dual judgment of divorce that was entered by the trial court following a six-day trial. Respondent husband was ordered to pay child support and rehabilitative alimony. Appellant was required to prevent the exposure of the children to her present boyfriend. Appellant complained that the restrictions regarding exposure of the children unnecessarily impinged on her right to marry. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and held that the best interests of the children could be made paramount to other fundamental rights. The court stated that there were few rights more fundamental in society than those of parents to retain custody over and care for their children, and to rear their children, as they deemed appropriate. The court held that the trial judge's award of rehabilitative alimony was appropriate in the case involving a relatively short marriage and a young divorcee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, waste disposal business and owners, challenged a decision of the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection (New Jersey), finding that appellants failed to comply with state and local regulations regarding solid waste disposal, assessing a monetary penalty, revoking appellants' certificate, and permanently debarring appellant owners from participating in the solid waste disposal industry in New Jersey.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, waste disposal business and owners, faced with conflicting state and local regulations, chose to utilize out-of-state solid waste disposal facilities, contravening state regulations. The Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection assessed a monetary penalty, revoked appellants' certificate, and permanently debarred appellant owners from participating in the solid waste disposal industry in New Jersey. Shortly thereafter, the federal courts determined that the state's system of flow control of waste violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I &sect; 8, cl. 3. The court concluded that the newly-announced federal case law's interpretation of federal constitutional rules was to be applied retroactively. Accordingly, the court held that, unless the federal decision was reversed or severely modified, the orders prohibiting out-of-state shipment of solid waste were constitutionally defective and the penalties imposed for violating those orders were to be rescinded. The court remanded the matter with instructions to radically reassess the penalties imposed and advised that appellants' mitigating factors be taken into account with respect to local violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order finding that appellants, waste disposal business and owners, failed to comply with state and local regulations regarding solid waste disposal because the recent federal decision holding that the state's waste laws violated the Commerce Clause was to be applied retroactively. The court remanded for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed appellant's conviction and remanded for a new trial. The court held that the officer exceeded the scope of the consent of appellant's grandmother when he searched a change purse because the grandmother's consent was limited to a search for a handgun and the officer admitted that the change purse was too small to contain a handgun. The court also held that appellant's grandmother did not have authority to consent to the search of closed containers within the room in which appellant was staying because the authority of the grandmother as owner of the premises did not extend to possessions of appellant, as occupier, that were not in plain view.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his extended term sentence from the Superior Court of New Jersey, Cumberland County, that was imposed pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:44-3(e) (the Hate Crime Statute). The defendant asserted that the statute was unconstitutional for vagueness and for violating due process by using a preponderance of the evidence standard. The defendant pled guilty to violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:39-4(a) and N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:39-3(a).</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 2C:44-3(e) (the Hate Crime Statute) was affirmed because as a sentencing factor it required as proof only preponderance of the evidence that the crime, proved beyond a reasonable doubt, was racially motivated. The court excised the words &quot;at least in part, with ill will, hatred or bias toward&quot; to cure the vagueness challenge as the legislature had done earlier. Defendant was arrested for twice firing a rifle into a neighbor's residence and at his door and windows. Statements made after his arrest raised the issue of whether his motivation was racial bias. He pled guilty to a firearm possession and an unlawful weapon possession and was sentenced to an extended term of 12 years on the firearm charge. The court found no constitutional impediment to a statutory requirement for an extended term upon the sentencing judge being satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence that the crime, either pled or proven beyond a reasonable doubt, was committed because of racial hatred.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that all evidence seized during his arrest should have been suppressed because he was arrested by police outside of their jurisdiction in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A: 14-152 and that such actions by police constituted a violation of his state and federal constitutional rights against unreasonable searches and seizures. The court affirmed the trial court's convictions of defendant and held that the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine applied only to evidence seized in violation of a suspect's constitutional rights. An arrest by police outside of their jurisdiction was not a violation of a law of constitutional dimension but was a procedural violation that did not affect defendant's constitutional rights regarding search and seizure. Moreover, police had probable cause to arrest defendant based on observation and did not infringe on defendant's state or federal constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure.</SPAN></P>

The tax court found that plaintiff's greenhouse was real, not personal, property, that N.J. Stat.

On review, the court held that the statutory exemption did not violate the state constitution, but reversed and remanded the cause for reconsideration as to whether the greenhouse fell within the statutory exemption. The court held that plaintiff's greenhouse was readily dismantled, like personal property rather than real property, so that it did not violate the basic law of real property. The court also found defendant's argument compelling that the greenhouse was not exempt because a portion of the structure enclosed a space within its walls used as an office and remanded to consider whether plaintiff's greenhouse was statutorily exempt.</SPAN></P>

The meeting was an official hearing before the committee on the budget of the United States House of Representatives. Defendant, unsuccessful at being recognized to speak before the meeting, attempted to attract the chairman's attention in a loud voice from the floor. Defendant was removed by police and struggled with them on the way. On appeal, the court reversed, and held that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant resisted arrest. Defendant's altercation with police took less than a 15 seconds. The court could not tell from the record, including video and audio tapes of the meeting, whether the police had announced to defendant their intention to arrest him. The court also held that defendant's brief shouts for recognition did not violate &sect; 2C:33-8 because they did not substantially impair the assemblage, and that the police were not authorized to arrest him without direction from the congressman presiding over the meeting.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a prior court order precluded defendant from following the victim, he was convicted of third-degree stalking, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:12-10c, and sentenced to a custodial term of five years. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:12-10 was not unconstitutionally overbroad, because freedom of speech did not encompass a right to abuse or annoy the victim intentionally. Also, &sect; 2C:12-10 was not impermissibly vague, because the specific intent required by &sect; 2C:12-10 clearly indicated what type of conduct was prohibited. Also, he was repeatedly warned and finally ordered by the prior trial court to cease contact with the victim, and he must have known that his behavior would annoy the victim or put her in fear of injury. Further, the court concluded that his argument that his conviction was against the weight of the evidence was barred procedurally by N.J. Ct. R. 2:10-1, because he failed to move for a new trial below, and lacked substantive merit, because a trial court could only set aside a jury's verdict under N.J. Ct.

Defendant was properly convicted of resisting arrest even though the police failed to utter the words that he was under arrest. The manslaughter instructions, while imperfect, were not erroneous when considered in their entirety. While the trial court failed to properly instruct the jury whether it could convict of felony murder when the predicate felony was bot charged, it was permissible to convict on the basis of the uncharged felony because the evidence supported the felony.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff retailer paid a tax assessment that arose as a result of an audit by defendant New Jersey Division of Taxation. Plaintiff later learned that defendant had changed its policy and no longer imposed sales and use taxes on labels. Plaintiff's claim for a refund was denied by defendant on the ground that the claim was filed too late. The Tax Court affirmed the denial by summary judgment. On appeal, the court reversed. Plaintiff's claim was made approximately five months after the original assessment and more than three months after the revised assessment. The court held that if defendant had already made its change in policy, then the assessment was a mistake. The court agreed with defendant's construction of the various statutes of limitation, and in the absence of estoppel or other equitable considerations, plaintiff should have filed a claim for a refund within 30 days of the assessment or filed a complaint with the Tax Court within 90 days of the assessment. However, plaintiff should have had an opportunity to establish grounds for estoppel or equitable relief. Therefore, summary judgment was not proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoners sought injunctive relief against respondent correctional medical services, challenging the constitutionality of the prison inmate copayment statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 30:7E-1 to -6, which imposed a $ 5 copayment on inmates for each inmate-initiated visit for medical, dental, emergency, and optometry services. The trial court concluded that appellants had not met the criteria for injunctive relief. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the fee program presumably provided adequate medical care at a nominal cost and that the statute did not deny medical services because of inability to pay. The court held that no reasonable jury could find that respondent's co-pay policy represented a cruel and unusual punishment in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The court concluded that the state had a legitimate interest in defraying the cost of health care provided to inmates incarcerated in state and county facilities and in reducing the alleged abuse of the sick-call policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner public employers and respondent unions had entered into collective negotiations agreements that included a provision for the binding arbitration of grievances. In each case, petitioners requested the Public Employment Relations Commission (PERC) to restrain the binding arbitration of a grievance in a minor disciplinary action involving a civil service employee. The cases were consolidated for appeal. The court held that the amended provision of N.J. Stat. Ann. 34:13A-5.3, which permitted binding arbitration as a procedure to resolve minor disciplinary actions involving employees, had a retroactive effect and was applicable to the instant employees. The court held that the amended provision applied to discipline of five days or less. The court held that procedural issues could also be referred to PERC. The court affirmed PERC's decision as to the Township of South Brunswick, holding that the case was not one of discipline. The dismissal of an employee by the County of Union was not within the civil service law. The court affirmed the decisions of PERC with the exception of those case involving non-police employees, which it reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the pilot programs exceeded the scope of powers which could have lawfully been delegated under &sect; 11A:2-11I, violated the plain language of &sect; 11A:2-11I by administratively controverting and altering the express provisions of existing statutes, and that they should not have been adopted without complying with the rule-making requirements of N.J.

The court further held there was not violation of equal protection because the statute was facially neutral and appellant's could not show a discriminatory intent behind the marital status classification. The court also held that there was no violation of the Executive Order that prohibited executive branch agencies from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation because the state health benefits plan refers to marital status, not sexual orientation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant homeowners contended that, as it was applied to them, plaintiff township's anti-noise ordinance was unconstitutionally subjective and vague and that the trial judge's evidentiary rulings were erroneous because they had been based upon an unconstitutionally subjective and vague construction of the ordinance. The court, however, noted that although the challenged ordinance was defectively vague in its failure to provide any guidance as to what constituted a violation of its provisions, it was not facially unconstitutional. The court held that such general language was permissible so long as courts utilized a reasonableness standard when applying the ordinance. The court then found that a purely subjective standard of behavior had been utilized to determine whether dog's barking had constituted a disturbance of the peace, noting that such a standard was unconstitutionally vague. The court reversed, concluding that although the neighbor's testimony had been sufficient to establish the times when defendants' dog had barked, her testimony failed to establish that its barking constituted an objectively unreasonable noise as required by New Jersey law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff and defendant construction companies sought review after the trial court dismissed a complaint challenging the constitutionality of the Underground Facility Protection Act (UFPA), N.J.

Specifically, the construction companies argued that the UFPA was unconstitutional because the state legislature had created its own procedure to indict violators and enacted a statute that allowed for the imposition of criminal penalties without affording an indictment and trial by jury. The court found that the construction companies' contentions addressed to the statute's constitutionality was without merit. The Board of Public Utilities' investigatory powers and hearings were not part of criminal proceedings and criminal sanctions could not flow therefrom. As no criminal proceeding was involved, and there was no administrative determination of guilt or innocence, the court concluded that the separation of power doctrine was not violated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and permanent injunction in favor of appellee businesses because N.J.

The court held that the statute involved commercial speech, which did not trigger a strict scrutiny standard. The statute's purpose struck a balance between the right of sexually-oriented businesses to reasonably announce their presence to potential patrons, and the legislative perception that sexually-oriented signage on a large scale created distractions which interfered with traffic safety and the welfare of minors. The statute did not curb political or noncommercial speech. The court held that the protected commercial speech of sexually-oriented businesses was lawfully regulated because the statute directly advanced a substantial governmental interest and was appropriately tailored to that purpose.

Subsequent to his conviction and unsuccessful direct appeal, case law required that the jury must be given specified definitions of &quot;upper echelon member&quot; and &quot;organized drug trafficking network.&quot; The trial court dismissed defendant's petition for post-conviction relief based on the trial court's failure to give the required jury charge. The court held that the definitional requirement was not a sudden and unanticipated repudiation of a long-standing practice, but was merely a clarification of the inherent ambiguity of the statute. The court held that the definitions were essential elements of the offense. The court found that retroactive application of the decision would not burden the administration of justice because retroactive application could only result in 10 new trials, including that of defendant. The court held that defendant was prejudiced by the improper jury charge and refused to speculate on what a properly instructed jury would have decided. Therefore, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged the decision of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Mercer County, that declared N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:33-12.2&nbsp;unconstitutional as a content-based restriction on free speech and void for vagueness and that permanently enjoined the statute's enforcement against anyone, including appellees, owners of pornographic supply stores.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, owners of pornographic supply stores, brought a declaratory action challenging the constitutionality of N.J.

The state challenged the trial court's determination that the statute was an unconstitutional content-based restriction on free speech and was further void for vagueness. In reversing, the court concluded that the statute was a content neutral regulation, where its overall purpose was aimed at the secondary effects of speech. Under the time, place, and manner standard, the statute was valid where it was designed to serve a substantial government interest and did not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication. The statute did not seek to ban the viewing of sexually explicit material, but was intended to regulate sexual conduct as a health problem. Further, it was not void for vagueness, as it adequately proscribed conduct and instructed commercial establishments to refrain from facilitating such conduct on their premises.</SPAN></P>

Further, the statute was not void for vagueness where it set forth the proscribed conduct and mandated that establishments refrain from its facilitating.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted respondent's request for injunctive relief and disqualified appellant MEC and appellant board of trustees from taking any further action regarding respondent's hospital privileges. The court reversed the order, holding that the mere fact that appellant MEC and appellant board of trustees investigated the matter and made preliminary decisions not to renew respondent's staff privileges did not render those bodies incompetent to adjudicate the issue in the context of an adversarial plenary hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff foreman appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Camden County (New Jersey) following a jury determination that he had not proved that he was doing his job as was expected by defendant employer. Plaintiff employee had brought an action under the Law Against Discrimination (LAD), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 10:5-1 to 42, against defendant employer, alleging that his termination had been racially motivated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff foreman was terminated by defendant employer following an incident when he waited four hours before sending an injured employee to the hospital. He brought an action including allegations under the Law Against Discrimination (LAD), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 10:5-1 to 42, that his termination was racially motivated. A jury ruled in defendant's favor. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that there was no evidence that an improper racial animus played a part in plaintiff's firing sufficient to shift the burden to defendant to explain that even so, it would still justifiably have fired plaintiff. The court held that plaintiff admitted that he had been warned with respect to his abusive treatment of his crew and to be more aware of safety, and that the plant manager told him he was being fired for failing to do so. The only evidence of defendant's reasons for firing plaintiff was the plant manager's testimony that he made the decision only after the injury incident because it was the last straw in a series of incidents that had occurred over an extended period of time and after repeated warnings from management and which reflected improper treatment of employees and their safety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment in favor of defendant was affirmed because plaintiff failed to show that his termination was racially motivated. He was warned against actions such as that leading to his termination. Defendant's award of summary judgment on plaintiff's employee manual claim was affirmed because no reasonable employee could fail to understand that the manual was not intended to alter defendant's right to terminate its employees with or without cause.</SPAN></P>

The court found no grounds to depart from the clear statutory language allowing respondents to place the liens based on the tenants' unpaid bills because appellants gave implied consent to the electrical service from respondents, which created an implied contract. The court found that enforcement of the liens did not cause an absurd result. The court further ruled that the intent was evident in the statute's language and that a common sense reading would support the superior court decision. The superior court's interpretation of the statute recognized the common law doctrine of privity, which the court found to be a requirement to enforce these liens.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, local board of education, changed its method of paying over its employees' voluntary salary deductions for credit union and annuity plans. The effect of the change was to deprive the employees of the additional interest that had formerly accrued between the two paydays. The lower court found that appellant's crediting method advanced money to teaching staff members for services not yet rendered. The lower court's decision was affirmed. The court held that the test for public purpose was not who received the funds or even when, but rather the extent to which their expenditure was connected with valid governmental functions or policies. Because public funds could validly be used to achieve a variety of public purposes by a variety of means, there could be no constitutional bar against the reasonable use of public funds to provide benefits of public employment, whether direct or indirect, substantial or incidental.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the lower court's decision to reverse the Board's decision to grant appellant's application for a use variance in order to construct a billboard. Appellant failed to satisfy its substantial burden of proof on the so-called positive and negative criteria in the New Jersey Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55D-1 to -112. Appellant also failed to establish a special reason for a use variance. Appellant made no effort to develop the property except by applying for the use variance. Appellant could not prove that the billboard variance did not substantially impair the existing zoning scheme, which called for water-oriented business. No state policy was advanced by planting billboards in the wetlands, and a billboard was not compatible with a water-oriented business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for possession of cocaine and heroin, possession of firearms, and stolen property, in the Atlantic County Superior Court of New Jersey.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of multiple drug and firearm charges, and stolen property charges. Defendant claimed that his convictions should be reversed because the trial court denied his request to sever trials, to preclude character and conviction evidence, admitted evidence obtained involuntarily, and denied his motion for a new trial, and request for counsel under the U. S. Const. amend. VI. The court held that the trial court erred when it compelled defendant to proceed on appeal without counsel. It held that defendant had not knowingly, intelligently waived his right to counsel. It also held that the trial court should have engaged in a colloquy with defendant that would test his understanding of the implications of the waiver and will provide the appellate tribunal with an objective basis for review. The trial court did not follow this course, and no attempt was made to determine whether defendant understood the implications of waiving his right to an attorney.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the cause back to the trial court for further proceedings because it found that it had improperly denied defendant's right to counsel. The court reasoned that even though it said that the other issues presented on appeal were without merit, that was partially because defendant wrote his own brief, which was inexpertly written and very difficult to understand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parishioner appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, which granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by defendants, the former rector and present rector of Episcopalian churches, pursuant to N.J. Ct. R. 4:6-2(e) in plaintiff's action for damages based on a sexual relationship between plaintiff and defendant former rector.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parishioner filed an action for damages based on a sexual relationship between plaintiff and defendant former church rector. The action against defendant present church rector was based on his disclosure of the relationship to the congregation. Defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings, pursuant to N.J. Ct. R. 4:6-2(e). The trial court granted the motion on all counts against defendant former rector and on one of the counts against defendant current rector, holding that the actions for clergy malpractice could not be recognized. Plaintiff appealed and the court reversed the trial court's judgment. Noting that the case was one of first impression in New Jersey, the court held that the issues presented problems of proof and definition that should not have been addressed on a motion to dismiss under rule 4:6-2(e), but should have awaited resolution on a more fully informed record. The court concluded that the test to determine whether a cause of action against a cleric was cognizable was whether adjudication required an evaluation of dogma, ritual, or other matters of ecclesiastical concern.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer challenged a prima facie tort award entered by the Superior Court, Essex County (New Jersey), in favor of cross-appellant ex-employee in a discharge action. Cross-appellant challenged the pretrial dismissal of his defamation claim and a judgment in favor of appellant on his claim under the Conscientious Employee Protection Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 34:19-1 to -8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cross-appellant ex-employee was fired by appellant employer after telling appellant's employees in Japan to reduce benzene levels in gasoline because the chemical posed a serious threat to the public health and environment. Cross-appellant filed suit against appellant under the Conscientious Employee Protection Act (CEPA), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 34:19-1 to -8, and for defamation. The jury ruled in favor of cross-appellant and awarded punitive damages, but the trial court entered judgment for appellant on the CEPA claim because cross-appellant failed to show a clear public policy violated by appellant. The trial court also amended to add a tort claim, entering judgment for cross-appellant, due to appellant's outrageous conduct. The trial court dismissed the defamation claim. On appeal the court reversed in part, as the tort claim was waived by filing a CEPA claim. The jury verdict and damage award was reinstated on the defamation claim, as it was independent of the CEPA claim. The judgment for appellant on the CEPA claim was improper as a CEPA claim could be based an employee's reasonable belief that a public policy was violated.</SPAN></P>

The trial court erred in dismissing the defamation claim against appellant employer, because it was independent of a CEPA claim. The court affirmed dismissal of a tort claim as barred by the CEPA waiver provision as it was based on the same retaliatory discharge as the CEPA claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, ratepayer advocate and cable company, sought review of a decision of the Board of Regulatory Commissioners (Board) that approved the phone company's petition for a new plan of regulation of rates. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the Board was not required to conduct a rate-base/rate-of-return analysis in order to determine whether rates under the plan were just and reasonable. The court also held that it was not persuasively established that any putative flaw in the plan as approved by the Board was so fundamental a deficiency as to require invalidation of the entire conception or, even, a modification of any element. The court further held that there was ample basis in the record to support each element of the approved plan. The court also determined that the Telecommunications Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 48:2-21.16 -21.21, did not require the maintenance of any previously approved plan as a prerequisite for effectuating any proposal pursuant to the new regulatory regime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, transit police officers' representative, challenged the decision of the Superior Court of New Jersey Essex County, which entered summary judgment in favor of defendant state transit corporation upholding the constitutionality of the random drug and alcohol testing of plaintiff's policemen who carry firearms. The trial court denied plaintiff's application for an order to show cause to obtain a temporary and permanent restraining order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, transit police officers' representative, filed a complaint against defendant state transit corporation arguing that those provisions of defendant's drug and alcohol policy that mandated the random testing of its policemen who carry firearms constituted an illegal search and seizure under N.J. Const. art. I, para. 7. The trial court entered summary judgment in defendant's favor and denied plaintiff's application for a restraining order. On review, the court affirmed, holding the proper balancing test, after determining whether a special need existed, was balancing the employees' privacy interests against those of the government employer in administering the drug-testing program. The court held defendant's need to conduct random, suspicionless searches outweighed the privacy interests of the officers represented by plaintiff to such a degree it was impractical to require either a warrant or individualized suspicion. The court held the special government need of protecting the public from the risk posed by officers who were impaired by drugs or alcohol could not be ignored. The court held the balancing test supported the constitutionality of defendant's drug-testing policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed an order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, which ruled that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:4A-43.1 and N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:43-2.2 were unconstitutional facially and as applied to defendant juveniles, who were adjudicated delinquent for acts which, if committed by an adult, would constitute aggravated sexual assault, triggering the statutory requirement of mandatory AIDS and HIV testing on request of the victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juveniles were adjudicated delinquent for forcing a 10-year-old girl to engage in sodomy and fellatio, constituting aggravated sexual assault under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:14-2a(1) if committed by an adult. The state requested an order compelling defendants to submit to HIV testing under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:4A-43.1 and N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:43-2.2. The trial court denied the order and ruled that the statutes were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the trial court did not err in taking testimony, but did err in giving it more weight than the legislative determination that HIV testing was in the public interest. The court held that while the mandatory removal and analysis of blood to detect HIV constituted a search, the state's compelling interest in the health and welfare of its citizens outweighed defendants' reduced expectation of privacy afforded by their status as adjudicated delinquents, particularly as the intrusion was slight and disclosure of the results tightly controlled. The court held that the statutes did not violate either the federal constitution or N.J. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's determination that the statutes requiring mandatory HIV testing for juvenile sex offenders were unconstitutional, because the state's interest in the health and welfare of the victim and the public outweighed the defendants' interest in preventing a slight bodily intrusion and the risk of disclosure of HIV status, especially as they had a reduced expectation of privacy due to being adjudicated delinquents.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 2C:20-5g claiming, that his business tactics were not proscribed, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:20-5g was unconstitutionally vague, improper jury instructions, and denial of self-representation. The court affirmed the lower court's conviction and held that defendant's threat to file a motion to set aside a sheriff's sale unless the successful bidder paid him $ 2,000 constituted attempted theft by extortion. There was ample evidence that had defendant voided the initial sale, he would not have substantially benefitted from a resale because he did not have the financial wherewithal to bid in good faith, and thus it was not business tactics. The court held that the statute was unconstitutional and not vague, and that defendant lacked good cause for substituting counsel and continuing pro se. In light of the untimeliness of defendant's application, the lower court properly found that defendant presented no legitimate basis upon which to delay the proceedings and denied defendant's application on the ground that he sought a de facto co-counsel arrangement with the assistant deputy public defender.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff creditor held a second mortgage on defendants' property. Plaintiff also held a first mortgage on two tracts of property owned exclusively by defendant mother. The savings &amp; loan association commenced a foreclosure action on the property owned by defendants. Plaintiff purchased the property at the foreclosure sale. Plaintiff asserted that the corporation owned by defendant daughter had defaulted on its loan and instituted an action to foreclose on the two tracts of property. Defendants sought review or an order from the lower court that denied their motion to vacate the judgment of foreclosure entered in favor of plaintiff creditor. The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court on the grounds of equitable estoppel, laches, and N.J. Ct. R. 4:50-2.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant realtor appealed the trial court's interlocutory order finding it liable under the Consumer Fraud Act (Act), N.J.

Defendant realtor argued that the trial court should have construed the Act to define misrepresentation according to its common law elements and that punitive damages were improper. The court affirmed the trial court's order as to defendant realtor's liability under the Act, holding that &sect; 56:8-2 makes a New Jersey real-estate-broker defendant strictly liable for any material misrepresentation of fact made to a purchaser. The court reversed the dismissal of plaintiff's fraud claims against defendant builder, because defendant builder's misrepresentations directly caused plaintiff's losses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, driver and automobile owner, in appellants', husband and wife, cause of action for damages arising out of an automobile accident. The trial court ruled that appellants failed to meet the verbal threshold pursuant to the New Jersey Deemer Statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:28-1.4. Appellants were residents of Pennsylvania and covered by an insurance policy with full tort option, comparable to New Jersey's no threshold coverage. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment in favor of appellees and ruled that, although appellants failed to meet the verbal threshold requirements, N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmates challenged the Department of Corrections' adoption of &quot;refusal to register as a sex offender&quot; to N.J.

They were confined for sexual offenses previously committed by them and were covered by the requirements of Megan's Law. On appeal, the court affirmed the adoption of the amendment, finding that the amendment was constitutional. The court found the amendment was not vague because the amendment merely added the refusal to register as a sex offender to the list of prohibited acts for which inmates could be punished and the requirement was clear. Further, the court determined that the statutory provisions, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:7-2c(2) and N.J. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer, by order to show cause and a verified complaint, filed an action against defendants, tax assessor, city, and bank, to stop actions to foreclose plaintiff's equity of redemption in two parcels of land. The trial court denied the requested relief on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction. By motion for reconsideration, plaintiff argued that N.J. Ct.

The court affirmed the decision, holding that the order dismissing plaintiff's claim was properly entered with prejudice. The court held that plaintiff's claim should have been brought on direct appeal from the judgments of the county board of taxation and the tax court. Plaintiff contended that the trial court had jurisdiction as its claim was based on 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court determined that plaintiff's &sect; 1983 claim was barred by the statute of limitations because it accrued when plaintiff knew it was being taxed on the basis of an arbitrary and unfair assessment, which arose more than two years before filing the claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Superior Court of Monmouth County (New Jersey), for the fourth degree crime of unlawful regulated activity in a freshwater wetlands area by willfully or negligently engaging in a regulated activity within such an area without a permit, contrary to the provisions of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:9B-9a, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:9B-17a, and N.J. Stat. Ann. 13:9B-21f.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had wood chips brought in to help level part of his land. He was charged with unlawful regulated activity in a freshwater wetlands area by willfully or negligently engaging in a regulated activity within such an area without a permit, in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:9B-9a, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:9B-17a, and N.J. Stat. Ann. 13:9B-21f.

The judge restated the elements of the crime and emphasized that the elements did not include a requirement that the state prove defendant knew the area in question was wetlands. The jury shortly returned with a conviction. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction and remanded for a new trial or other action the prosecutor or commissioner deemed appropriate. The court found that the trial judge, by advising the jury that the state was not required to prove defendant knew the area in question was either a wetlands or a transition area, effectively made defendant strictly liable and, for practical purposes, directed the verdict against defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey which convicted him of possession of cocaine and sentenced him to three years probation with several conditions, including strict narcotic controls.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped by the police because the rear lights of his car were out. As he was pulling over, the officer saw him bend down towards the floor, and, when he asked defendant for his license, he detected the odor of alcohol. He then searched the car and found cocaine in it. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court erred in refusing to grant his motion to suppress and that a jury charge diluted the state's burden of proof and thus denied him due process of law. The state claimed that the trial court erred in not imposing mandatory penalties. In affirming the judgment, the court found the missing rear lights gave police had a reasonable suspicion of a motor violation. It also found that defendant's furtive movements and the odor of alcohol gave the officer probable cause to believe a crime had been committed; thus, the search of the car was justified. Therefore, the motion to suppress was properly denied. The court found that the jury charge which included the phrase &quot;the law requires a moral certainty&quot; with respect to a finding of guilt did not dilute the state's burden of proof. The court found that the fees for the statutory violation were mandatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction because his initial stop by police for a traffic violation was clearly justified and his actions, together with the odor of alcohol, gave police probable cause to believe that a crime had been committed and to search defendant's car. The phrase &quot;moral certainty&quot; in the jury charge on reasonable doubt did not dilute the state's burden of proof. The case was remanded for imposition of statutory penalties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a disciplinary hearing, plaintiff employee, was terminated from employment in connection with an altercation he had with a subordinate employee. After defendant city rejected plaintiff employee's request for a rehearing, plaintiff employee and plaintiff labor union representative filed a complaint against defendant city and defendant city administrator. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs, directing defendant city to reinstate plaintiff employee. The court affirmed the summary judgment ruling, but reversed and dismissed the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim. The court held that the trial court properly exercised jurisdiction to review the municipal action taken by defendant city in an action in lieu of prerogative writs under N.J. Ct. R. 4:69. The court held that although plaintiff employee's hearing passed constitutional muster, it was not fair because he did not have an opportunity to confront and cross-examine his employee. However, because plaintiff employee's right to confront and cross-examine the adverse witness was not of federal constitutional dimension, it did not provide a basis for &sect; 1983 action.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that inmate's period of parole ineligibility could not be reduced, either through the application of commutation credits or through the compilation of inmate work credits, below the statutorily mandated term of imprisonment for murder. The court held that since the full sentence and the mandatory minimum term were of the same length, inmate simply could not reduce his 30-year sentence. The court further held that inmate could not establish that he had secured a federal constitutional right to reduce his mandatory minimum sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant teacher applied for a substitute teaching position in the public school system. As part of the application requirements, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:6-7 and N.J. Stat.

Prior to signing the oath, appellant added qualifying amendments to the oath. Appellant was interviewed and led to believe that he would be called to teach. Appellant was never called to substitute teach. Upon inquiry, appellant learned that he would not be called to substitute teach because of the qualifications he added to the oath. Appellant brought an action for declaratory judgment and alleged that the oath violated his U.S. Const. amend. I and U.S. Const. amend. XIV rights. The court held that the required oath did not violate appellant's constitutional rights and that the New Jersey oath was similar to the Colorado oath which was summarily affirmed by the United States Supreme Court as constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>

The tax court held the Act was valid and a factor in valuing watershed land. Appellant sought review and on appeal the court affirmed. The court held that the legislature intended the moratorium to continue, that it anticipated that watershed protection would go forward and although a final comprehensive bill had not yet passed, this did not mean that all prior activity should be vitiated. The court held an interpretation of the Act concluding that the moratorium expired would fly in the face of common sense, omit consideration of the breadth and importance of the legislative objectives, and render the 1990 amendment futile. The court held the legislature intended the limit on the transfer of watershed lands to continue until a statewide watershed system was in place, the moratorium was still in effect, the moratorium was not a temporary restraint that created a transitory absence of market, and thus, it was properly considered in determining true value.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile was convicted of two counts of juvenile delinquency, which, if committed by an adult would have constituted first-degree aggravated sexual assault under N.J.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a decision by the New Jersey Department of Corrections that set his maximum total sentence expiration date on three convictions and two parole violations. N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:44-5c provided that on a prison sentence for a crime committed while on parole, the new term and any term of re-imprisonment on the parole revocation were to run consecutively unless the trial court ordered otherwise.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New Jersey Department of Corrections set appellant's maximum aggregate sentence expiration date after appellant was convicted of three crimes and committed two parole violations by new crimes. Appellant sought review putting into issue the maximum aggregate sentence expiration. The court found that the issue presented centered on N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:44-5c. At the time, periods of imprisonment for a crime committed while on parole and periods of re-imprisonment for prior crimes committed were to run consecutively unless otherwise ordered by the trial court. Prior to 1984, they were to run concurrently unless otherwise ordered. Appellant was sentenced before the effective date of the amendment, but violated parole after that date. The court found that there was no violation of ex post facto law under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 or N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; 7. The court did not see any disadvantage to appellant under the amendment because both before and after the 1984 amendment, P.L. 1983, c. 462, &sect; 1, to &sect; 2C:44-5c, it remained the responsibility of the trial court to determine whether or not sentences should run concurrently or consecutively. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court found that appellant was not disadvantaged by the application of the statutory amendment providing for consecutive sentences even though, prior to the amendment, the statute had provided for concurrent sentences, and appellant was sentenced before the effective date of that amendment but violated parole after that date.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C: 25-17 et seq., barring her from having contact with her husband except in matters related to their children. Defendant was convicted of violating the temporary restraining order and the final restraining order. The court found that the record supported the trial court's determination that defendant violated the temporary restraining order by visiting her husband's home. The court concluded, however, that defendant did not exhibit the purpose to harass required for the second conviction. Defendant's mere use of offensive language did not violate the final restraining order, in light of the important protections afforded to speech in U.S. Const. amend. I. The court affirmed the first conviction, reversed the second, and noted that the sentence was incorrect. The matter was remanded for correction and further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hospital association sought review of order by the state commissioner of the department of health (commissioner), which denied refund of tax assessments paid under the Health Care Cost Reduction Fund, N.J. Stat.

The court affirmed the judgment in favor of respondent attorney general and state and dismissed the appeal, concluding that appellant was not entitled to retroactive application of the decision declaring the assessments excessive, and that prospective relief of refund was also unavailable. The court explained appellant was not entitled to a refund because the payments made were voluntary and not a product of any duress exercised by the commissioner. The court further noted that where a tax was voluntarily paid on a demand not enforceable without fraud , duress, or mistake of fact, as here, such payments were not recoverable. The court concluded that no mistake of fact existed because appellant's mistake was one of law, where it paid based on belief the assessments were correct.</SPAN></P>

Appellants challenged the trial court's order and claimed that providing garbage service to apartment buildings having less than four units promoted home ownership.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs former employees filed suit against defendants Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (Port Authority), union, and members based on a labor contract dispute. The trial court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint against defendants with prejudice, because federal labor law governed, and ordered the parties to participate in binding arbitration. The parties challenged the trial court's order, and the court reversed the order insofar as it required arbitration because plaintiffs did not assert this relief. The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of plaintiffs' complaint, but held that the trial court incorrectly surmised that federal labor law governed plaintiffs' claims because defendant Port Authority was exempt from the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C.S. 152 &sect; 2(2). The court held that plaintiffs' claims against defendant union should have been dismissed because they were based on federal labor law and that plaintiffs' claims against Port Authority should have been dismissed for failure to comply with the notice of claim requirements mandated by N.J.

The court held that the phrase &quot;overgrown and unsightly&quot; was not sufficiently definite to give reasonable notice of the prohibited conduct to those who wished to avoid its penalties and to apprise the factfinder of standards of the determination of guilt. In addition, the ordinance was overly broad because it did not permit the enforcement officer acting in good faith to be able to point to objective facts that would have led a reasonable person to realize that his or her conduct was a violation of the ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with killing two victims and was served at his arraignment with notice of aggravating factors weighing in favor of imposing the death penalty. At trial, the court refused to instruct the jury that capital punishment could be imposed for purposely or knowingly causing serious bodily injury (SBI) resulting in death. On appeal by the state, the court affirmed, holding that the death penalty could not be imposed for purposely or knowingly causing serious bodily injury resulting in death where the offense occurred after adoption of the state constitutional amendment declaring such punishment not cruel and unusual punishment, but before the amendment of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3 to expressly provide that SBI murder may support a death sentence. At the time the constitutional amendment was adopted, the statute did not clearly expose SBI murders to the death penalty. Once the constitutional amendment was approved, it was necessary for the legislature to implement the change. The purpose of placing the amendment before the voters was to remove the constitutional impediment, it did not in itself amount to legislative action amending the existing statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both appellant widow and respondent estate sought review of a judgment, entered by the Superior Court of New Jersey, granting appellant an elective share of her late husband's assets, held by respondent estate, pursuant to N. J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3B:8-1, and denying either party an award of counsel fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant widow elected against her late husband's will and sued respondent estate, demanding additional assets because property received from the decedent and otherwise acquired was less than one-third of the augmented estate under the elective share statute. The lower court rejected respondent's claim of marital disqualification, and awarded additional assets to appellant, while denying counsel fees to either. Both parties appealed, and the court reversed. The lower court's valuation of the &quot;augmented estate&quot; was incorrect, because it included the value of a trust interest which applicable law expressly excluded; because it excluded from the value of appellant's existing assets her interest in a trust settled by her father; and because it applied a &quot;discount&quot; factor to the value of appellant's interests in a decedent's closely held corporation. The court found that a discount was inappropriate in a liquidation sale situation; and that, based on correct valuations of the estate and of appellant's preexisting assets, appellant's share of assets had exceeded one-third of the estate, so that she was not entitled to additional assets. Nor was either party entitled to counsel fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed a lower court ruling granting appellant widow additional assets from respondent estate, finding errors in the valuation of the &quot;augmented&quot; estate relating to the inclusion of certain trust assets and the exclusion of others, and finding that the value of appellant's minority interest in decedent's closely held corporation was improperly discounted. The court also held that neither party was entitled to counsel fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of exposure to asbestos products in a shipyard, decedent developed severe asbestosis and mesothelioma. Plaintiff, as decedent's executor and in her own right, brought a wrongful death and survival action against defendants, more than ten asbestos manufacturers, for failure to provide proper warnings concerning their asbestos products. The trial court found for plaintiff and awarded compensatory and punitive damages. Defendant asbestos manufacturer appealed. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial on the issue of punitive damages, because certain documents were admitted without either a proper foundation or a proper jury charge. The court also ordered that compensatory damages be recomputed to reflect defendant asbestos manufacturer's 30 percent responsibility, because the trial judge erred by not molding the verdict, equally divided between two defendants, to 60 percent responsibility at issue after one defendant stipulated to 40 percent responsibility. Otherwise, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded for a new trial on the issue of punitive damages, because certain documents were admitted without either a proper foundation or a proper jury charge. The court also ordered that compensatory damages had to be recomputed to reflect defendant asbestos manufacturer's 30 percent responsibility.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction finding that the level-of-intrusion on motorists stopped briefly at mobile inspections teams vehicle safety checkpoints was minimal, usually not more than two to three minutes. The court found that the evidence disclosed that the safety checkpoints uncovered numerous violations that substantially advanced the state's interest in highway and vehicular safety and were an effective regulation and law enforcement technique in enforcing traffic safety. The court found that the state's obligation to the federal government under the Clean Air Act enhanced the safety inspection. The court refused to extend greater protection under the state's constitution than what was provided by the federal constitution. The court vacated the stay imposed on execution of defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Essex County, which convicted defendant of multiple charges including first degree kidnapping, attempted aggravated sexual assault, and attempted sexual assault. Pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:13-1c(2), the trial court merged the attempt convictions into the kidnapping conviction and imposed a life term with a 25 year period of parole ineligibility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During defendant's trial for kidnapping and sexual assault, the trial court denied defendant's request that the jury consider the preconditions required by N.J.

Following defendant's convictions for first degree kidnapping, attempted aggravated sexual assault, and attempted sexual assault, the trial court merged the attempt convictions into the kidnapping conviction and imposed &sect; 2C:13-1c(2)'s enhanced sentence. Defendant sought review, and the court affirmed the convictions but vacated the sentence. In vacating the sentence, the court found that the trial court was required to submit to the jury the question of whether defendant had committed a sexual assault upon a victim under the age of 16 during the course of the kidnapping in order to impose the enhanced sentence under &sect; 2C:13-1c(2). Furthermore, the court found that defendant's attempt convictions had not provided the requisite foundation for imposing the enhanced sentence under &sect; 2C:13-1c(2) because the attempts had not come within the preconditions required for enhancement.</SPAN></P>

The lower court, despite concluding that it lacked jurisdiction, ruled that the individual defendants had absolute immunity from suit under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and dismissed plaintiff's common law negligence claim. Plaintiff appealed from the summary judgment in defendants' favor. The court affirmed the dismissal of plaintiff's common law negligence claim against defendant appraiser, but reversed the dismissal of plaintiff's &sect; 1983 claims. The court dismissed defendants' cross appeals. The court remanded and directed that the case be assigned to the tax court judge. The court concluded that the trial court erred in holding that it lacked jurisdiction over the matter and in holding that defendants enjoyed absolute immunity from a suit. The court held that because defendant tax assessor's responsibilities were neither legislative nor judicial in nature, no immunity applied. The court held that defendants had not established immunity at common law required to support a claim of absolute immunity from suit under the Federal Civil Rights Act.</SPAN></P>

He accepted a plea agreement that sentenced him to one year in prison.

By statute, the Comprehensive Drug Reform Act of 1986, N.J.S.A. 2C:35-1 et seq., mandated a minimum sentence of three years without parole. However, prosecutors were allowed to lessen the sentence by plea agreement.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:6A-1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, injured driver and wife, residents of another state, filed a personal injury tort action against defendant driver. The trial court dismissed the action because plaintiffs failed to satisfy the verbal threshold requirements under the New Jersey Automobile Reparation Reform Act (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:6A-1 et seq., which limited certain plaintiffs' ability to recover non-economic damages. Plaintiffs argued that the Act's application to out-of-state motorists violated the privileges and immunities clause of U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2, cl. 1. The court affirmed. Under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17: 28-1.4, nonresidents whose insurer was authorized to transact motor vehicle insurance business in New Jersey were automatically assigned the verbal threshold tort option under N.J. Stat. Ann. 39:6A-8(a), which limited the right to sue for non-economic loss. The court held that the privileges and immunities clause protected only certain fundamental rights basic to the livelihood of the nation. Even if the right to sue for non-economic damages was protected, the legislation passed constitutional scrutiny because it was closely related to the advancement of a substantial state interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured party sought review of a decision of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Mercer County, which refused to apply the 1990 amendment of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:6A-8 retroactively to plaintiff and the jury returned a verdict of no cause of action, in plaintiff's personal injury action against defendant driver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature amended N. J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:6A-8, effective 1990, to afford an injured party, who had no automobile insurance, and was not part of the household of an immediate family member who did, the benefit of the no-threshold option. Plaintiff injured party brought a personal injury action against defendant driver. The trial court refused to apply the 1990 amendment to &sect;39:6A-8 retroactively. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that intent to apply a statute retroactively was implied to give it the most sensible interpretation. There was no reason why the legislature would want to treat plaintiff, who was injured before the 1990 amendment cured an oversight in a 1988 revision of the statute, to be treated differently than those whose injuries occurred after the effective date in 1990. Another justification for retroactive application was that the 1990 amendment provided a change in the form of remedy. Applying the statute retroactively was not manifestly unjust because defendant did not rely on the prior law and his conduct was not motivated by expectations he had concerning the capability of people injured by his negligence to sue him.</SPAN></P>

Applying the statute retroactively was not manifestly unjust because defendant did not rely on the prior law's protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff developers sought review of a judgment of defendant planning board (New Jersey) that assessed a contribution for future traffic improvements against plaintiff after defendant approved plaintiff's proposed subdivision plan, pursuant to the County Planning Act, N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant planning board approved plaintiff developers proposed subdivision and reserved the necessity of off tract traffic improvements. A study was done and plaintiffs were assessed a contribution for future traffic improvements. Plaintiffs challenged the fee assessed by defendants. The appeals court affirmed, holding that defendant had the authority to assess the fees under the County Planning Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:27-1 to -8. The court held that the assessment was made in accordance with the ordinance and that defendant had the independent power to impose the traffic fees. The argument that the New Jersey Transportation Development District Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27:1C-1 to -18, was the exclusive means by which traffic impact fees could be assessed against developers was rejected, as the acts were not to be read in conflict. Defendant satisfied the &quot;rational nexus&quot; requirement and the assessment against plaintiffs was proper. As the ordinance was adopted after a comprehensive study and defendant engaged in a rigorous process designed to achieve a fair allocation of increased traffic costs, plaintiffs' objections were unavailing.</SPAN></P>

Appellant maintained that due process requires that its attorney or stenographer be allowed. The Education Commissioner had responsibility of developing and administering a statewide system for evaluating school systems' performance under N.J. Stat. Ann. 18A:7A-2a. School districts that did not satisfy the basic criteria were to be subject to heightened scrutiny, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. 18A:7A-14a(1). Appellant was placed under heightened scrutiny. Because appellant did not cure deficiencies, it was subject to an independent investigation. On appeal, the court held that appellant was not entitled to have an attorney or stenographer present at the investigative interviews. The court held that no state constitutional right was violated by the denial of assistance of counsel in purely investigatory administrative proceedings, especially where there was no hint of criminal charges.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff newspaper filed a complaint in lieu of prerogative writs, seeking access to records of permits for the sale and purchase of firearms. Plaintiff contended these records were subject to the Right to Know Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1A-1 to -4. The trial court granted summary judgment to defendant township, primarily because an administrative regulation exempted background investigations related to firearm purchases from the Right to Know Law. The trial court utilized the common law public records balancing test to deny access to the permits and firearm purchaser identification cards. On appeal, the court first determined that some documents should not have been included within the category of statutory Right to Know Law documents. Next, the court found that the legislature did not delegate authority to the Superintendent of the Division of State Police to adopt a privacy regulation in connection with implementing the gun control legislation. However, the court upheld the trial court's decision because a strong public interest favored limited disclosure of the records that plaintiff sought. The court granted plaintiff leave to amend pleadings to make more limited inquiries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners appealed from a summary judgment in favor of defendants, city, building inspector, and director of public works. Plaintiffs sought to recover damages sustained by their real property as a result of a series of fires. The fires were caused by unauthorized persons in vacant buildings owned by defendant city, and the fires eventually spread to plaintiffs' properties. The court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on the ground that defendants could not be held liable for the fire damage to plaintiffs' properties under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59:4-2. The trial court held that defendants were immune under any theory of liability based upon the failure to enforce the construction code regulations. Plaintiff appealed. The court found that defendant city, in its capacity as a landowner, negligently maintained its buildings in a dangerous condition. Therefore, while defendants were immune from any liability for failure to enforce construction codes, a genuine issue of material fact existed whether defendants negligently maintained their buildings in a dangerous condition. Therefore the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner had operated a sand and gravel extraction operation on her land as a non-conforming use, but had ignored the various government regulations pertaining to such use, which led to its closure. Years later, appellant found a buyer whose purchase was contingent upon the use of the land for sand and gravel extraction. In the meantime, the Pinelands Protection Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:18A-1 to -29, was enacted and, pursuant thereto, N.J. Admin.

Appellant sought review of the regulation and the court sustained its validity, finding that it was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious, and it furthered the state interest in preserving sensitive land in its natural condition and promoted compatible agricultural, horticultural, and recreational uses.

However, defendant refused to grant a hearing unless plaintiffs first posted the proposed penalty amount in the form of a surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit or trust agreement, or some other form of financial assurance approved by defendant. Plaintiffs appealed the refusal, and the court reversed. The court ruled that a provision requiring the posting of financial security in the amount of the proposed penalty in advance does not satisfy due process unless there is some interim procedure offering the putative violator an opportunity to be heard without posting security after he has received notice of the violation and before assessment of a final order and issuance of the penalty. Because there was no such statutory or administrative regulatory scheme for enforcement of the Water Pollution Control Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 58:10A-1 et seq., the court ruled that the provision which required posting of financial assurance for payment of the penalty as a condition to obtaining a hearing was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order requiring plaintiffs to post the proposed penalty amount before receiving a formal hearing. The court ruled that the provision requiring prepayment of the proposed penalty was unconstitutional because it did not satisfy the minimum due process requirements that there be a forum where an order's validity can be challenged without penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation closed one of its supermarket's in the downtown area, and sold the property to a merchant, who then sold the property to defendant city.

The court affirmed the judgment which held that plaintiff's covenant adversely impacted the public interest and therefore was unenforceable. Closing the supermarket caused difficulties and hardships on the downtown citizens, who lost the only opportunity to purchase food at a reasonably close location. Plaintiff's restriction impeded the relocation of another supermarket operation to the downtown area. This obstacle to remediation efforts by defendant city was so contrary to the public policies expressed in the New Jersey Urban Enterprise Zone Act, N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff third party reprisal claimants appealed an order from the Superior Court, Law Division, Middlesex County (New Jersey), that granted defendant employer's motion for failure to state a claim as to plaintiffs' claim for retaliatory discharge in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. 10:5-12d of the Law Against Discrimination Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10:5-1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff third party reprisal claimants filed suit against defendant employer, under the Law Against Discrimination Act (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10:5-1 et seq., claiming that they were discharged in retaliation for their personal relationship with a co-employee who had filed a federal suit for discrimination. The state court dismissed these claims based upon defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under N.J. Ct. R. 4:6-2(e). The appellate court reversed. The appellate court liberally construed N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10:5-12d, as protecting any person who sought to protect their own or someone else's rights under the Act. It reasoned that to fulfill the Act's broad objectives and overall design, even coworkers or co-employed relatives of an employee who assert rights under the Act have standing to litigate a claim of retaliation. Consequently, the court held that where plaintiffs filed a suit pleading retaliation under &sect; 12d, and having alleged a palpable factual basis for that claim, including a personal relationship to a co-employee who asserted her rights under the Act, plaintiffs could not be nonsuited under rule 4:6-2(e).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court consolidated several actions to answer two questions.

The court held that personal injury protection was available to plaintiff insureds, and as such they were also entitled to reimbursement under the UCJ fund. It held that the express language of the applicable statutes mandated that the UCJF reimburse an out-of-state insurer authorized to transact business in New Jersey for Personal Injury Protection benefits paid to an injured party as the result of a New Jersey automobile accident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for possession with intent to deliver cocaine, aggravated assault and resisting a police officer in the performance of his duties in the Bergen County Superior Court (New Jersey). He claimed that the trial court erred when it denied his request for a new attorney, it admitted improper evidence, and when it dismissed the case against the co-defendant but refused to sever the remaining cases against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of cocaine with the intent to deliver, aggravated assault, and resisting a police officer in the performance of his duties. He claimed that he was entitled to a new trial because the trial court refused to excuse his attorney, sever the trials, dismissed the case against the co-defendant and when it improperly admitted evidence which was obtained by unconstitutional means. The court reviewed defendants' several contentions and found his appeal to be without merit. The court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's request to permit his counsel to withdraw as trial date was close, and having counsel remain in the case would not in and of itself support an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The court also held that pursuant to N. J. R. Crim. Proc. 3:15 &sect; 2, the trial court properly balanced the potential prejudice to defendant's due process rights against prosecution's interest in not presenting two trials for the same facts and evidence. The court held that evidence seized from defendant was properly obtained, and the evidence against defendant was overwhelming, so a directed verdict was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A person who received unemployment compensation benefits had to requalify in order to receive such benefits after the benefit year. To requalify, a person had to have engaged in four weeks of employment since the beginning of the immediately preceding benefit year and have earned at least six times his previous weekly benefit amount. Appellee Board of Review, Department of Labor, rejected appellant's argument that he satisfied these requirements through his service for more than four weeks in a workfare program. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that there was no systematic accumulation of funds during periods of employment under workfare programs to provide benefits for periods of unemployment. The court found that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 43:21-19(i)(1)(D)(v) excluded services performed in workfare programs from the definition of employment when determining whether the minimum employment requirement for requalification had been met.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 54A:1-1-54:10-12, did not violate federal equal protection and due process rights by requiring plaintiffs to file a joint state income tax return when filing a joint federal return.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, husband and wife, filed a declaratory judgment action against defendant state, alleging that the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act, N.J.

The trial court granted summary judgment for defendant, which the court affirmed on appeal. The court held that the rational basis standard applied, because government regulations affecting marriage were not subject to strict scrutiny unless they presented a direct obstacle to marriage. The court held that the tax law did not present a direct obstacle to marriage, but that it did have a rational basis, in that the administrative convenience of requiring the use of the same filing status for state and federal income tax returns made the auditing process for both federal and state taxing agencies more efficient. The court held that the tax law was therefore constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hospitals challenged orders from the New Jersey Department of Health, the Superior Court Essex County (New Jersey), and the Superior Court Morris County (New Jersey), which found in favor of respondent state-qualified utilization review organizations and held that appellants were required to permit respondents to conduct reviews during 1993.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department of Health (DOH) informed appellant hospitals how respondent state-qualified utilization review organizations were to function during 1993, and that appellants were expected to collect sufficient funds from payors to pay for respondents' services. Appellants challenged the interpretation of the DOH. The appeals focused on whether appellants were required to permit respondents to conduct reviews during the 1993 transition year and whether appellants were required to pay for those reviews. The court affirmed the interpretation of DOH that respondents were to be used to conduct limited reviews during 1993 only, and affirmed the lower court orders, vacating one order's stay of the payment provision. The court rejected the contentions that the DOH acted arbitrarily. The court found that respondents' system was free from payors' economic interests and that the DOH could use the review information in conjunction with its licensing powers to prevent abuses in the provision of medical services or health care costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed judgments, which affirmed the interpretation of the Department of Health that respondent state-qualified utilization review organizations were to be used to conduct limited reviews during 1993. The legislature entrusted the Department of Health with the responsibility of selecting the means of achieving statutory policy, so nexus between remedy and goal to be accomplished was peculiarly a matter for administrative competence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former employee challenged a final decision from the Division of Pensions, Department of Treasury (New Jersey), which denied him retirement benefits through respondent Police and Firemen's Retirement System but ordered all his contributions returned to him. Appellant was a Senior Corrections Officer at a youth facility when he was indicted for several criminal acts arising from his employment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In considering appellant former employee's challenge to the denial of retirement benefits through respondent Police and Firemen's Retirement System, the court rejected appellant's argument that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 43:16A-11.2 was unconstitutional facially and as applied, because it denied equal protection and due process by automatic forfeiture of pension benefits based on age. The court concluded that the alleged disparate treatment between appellant and another indicted employee was not based on age but on valid distinctions between public employees in service as of the date of retirement and those employees who left office prior to age 55 but sought a deferred retirement at age 55. The court asserted that the statute plainly required that an applicant be an active police officer over age 55 on the date of application for retirement and as of the date when actual retirement commenced, so appellant was not eligible. The court explained that the other indicted employee applied for retirement before his sentencing occurred, while appellant was terminated and applied for pension benefits after his sentence was affirmed on appeal. The court affirmed the decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of respondent Board of Trustees of the Police and Fireman's Retirement System against appellant former employee, because he was plainly ineligible according to the statute, which was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant township planning board appealed the decision of the Superior Court of Monmouth County (New Jersey), which declared a zoning ordinance invalid that prohibited retail stores, like that operated by intervenor retail store, that sold materials outside the premises of plaintiff realty's shopping center, but on the same land as the shopping center. Defendant contended that it had a rational basis for the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff realty owned land on which a shopping center was located. Plaintiff sought approval from defendant township planning board for the expansion of the mall. The expansion included intervenor retail store's indoor and outdoor home improvement center. Defendant adopted a zoning ordinance, which excluded retail stores that sold lumber or building materials outside the premises from the regional commercial shopping center district, as intervenor would have done. Defendant appealed the trial court's judgment that declared the zoning ordinance invalid. Plaintiff and intervenor appealed the litigation expense award amount. The court reversed and found that the zoning ordinance was valid and that intervenor's use was impermissible. The court also reversed the awards of litigation expenses. The court found that the ordinance was presumably valid. Defendant had a rational basis for prohibiting retail stores, like intervenor, from selling materials outside a completely enclosed building because it could have been aesthetically displeasing and was more likely to create fire hazards, litter, and dust. The ordinance was also consistent with the municipality's land use laws.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners appealed the decision of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Somerset County, which found for defendants, department of transportation and municipalities, and denied a declaratory judgment that the Air Safety and Hazardous Zoning Act of 1983, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 6:1-80 to -88, and the New Jersey Airport Safety Act of 1983, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 6:1-89 to -97, were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners' requested that the Air Safety and Hazardous Zoning Act of 1983 (Air Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 6:1-80 to -88, and the New Jersey Airport Safety Act of 1983 (Airport Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 6:1-89 to -97, be found unconstitutional regarding an airport construction. Plaintiffs' request was denied in favor of defendants, department of transportation and municipalities. The court affirmed and found the Air Act was not facially unconstitutional or unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs as a taking without just compensation because the lands' intended use did not substantially interfere with plaintiffs' use. There was no showing that plaintiffs were denied the economic use of the land or that their present uses were to be affected. To be unconstitutional as an expenditure of public funds for private purposes under the state constitution, the court had to determine whether the legislative provision of financial aid was for a public purpose and whether the means were consonant with that purpose. Because the legislature determined that an airport was for a public purpose, plaintiffs failed to show that the Airport Act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and found that although the grant of the easement was constitutional because it had a rational nexus to the needs created by and benefits conferred upon defendant, the grant was unconstitutional because the easement as not to be used imminently. However, because defendant had not sought to void the transfer within 45 days of the transfer under N.J. Ct. R. 4:49-6, the claim to void the transfer was time-barred. There was no applicable exception under rule 4:49-6(c) because there was no novel constitutional issue and there was no important public, rather than private, clarification or adjudication involved.

Defendant was granted summary judgment because a 66 foot right of way granted in 1765 on which plaintiffs' home encroached, was still in effect. Plaintiffs had asserted the need for a permit to encroach. The court affirmed and found that an unconstitutional taking of plaintiffs' property had not occurred, due to the fact that they were aware of the encroachment prior to their purchase of the home and adjusted the price accordingly. The court noted that due to the plaintiffs' adjustment in sales price they were equitably estopped to demand compensation for any alleged taking. The plaintiffs argued that the roadway was not where the recorded, legal description in the grant of the right of way described. However, the court rejected this issue because the roadway was an ancient road and followed the same pathway for 200 years, and its precise location would not affect the width of the right of way to which the public remained entitled.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a co-defendant were indicted for second degree robbery, attempted kidnapping, criminal restraint, kidnapping, and aggravated sexual assault. Defendant was convicted of all charges, except the trial court merged his conviction for aggravated sexual assault into his conviction for kidnapping. Defendant's convictions were affirmed, but remanded for reconsideration of the sentence. Defendant petitioned for post-conviction relief. Defendant was resentenced pursuant to remand to an aggregate term of imprisonment without eligibility for parole, which more than doubled the period of parole ineligibility imposed under his original sentence. Defendant filed separate notices of appeal from the denial of his petition for post-conviction relief and his resentencing. Defendant contended he received ineffective assistance of counsel, was denied due process because his co-defendant was sentenced to less than the minimum, and was improperly resentenced after he started serving time. In affirming the convictions, the court held that defendant received effective assistance of counsel, was not denied due process, and was properly resentenced even though he had started to serve time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents were limited dividend housing corporations and associations who entered into tax abatement agreements with appellant city of Newark relieving them of the obligation to pay property taxes but requiring them to pay an annual service charge for municipal services upon building of homes in blighted areas. When the agreements were executed, city was required by municipal ordinance to provide garbage collection services to respondents' facilities. However, the ordinance was repealed. Six years after city stopped collecting garbage respondents filed an action against city. The trial court granted partial summary judgment to respondents and ordered city to pick up their garbage within 30 days. The court affirmed holding that garbage collection was a municipal service which the city had contracted to provide for the duration of the tax abatement agreements. The court also reversed that portion granting garbage collection within 30 days without full consideration of all relevant facts and remanded for a complete record on the issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff university sought review after the trial court dismissed its complaint against defendants pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:14-1.1. The issue on appeal was whether the ancient, and almost dead, doctrine of nullum tempus occurrit regi (no time runs against the state) barred defendants' reliance upon &sect; 2A:14-1.1. The trial judge concluded that the doctrine applied only to statutes of limitations, that &sect; 2A:14-1.1 was a statute of repose, and that, in any event, nullum tempus was no longer favored. The court agreed that the doctrine of nullum tempus was no longer favored. However, the court disagreed with the finding that the doctrine was not applicable to plaintiff at the time it filed its complaint. Specifically, there was no basis for limiting the doctrine to only what might be characterized as pure statutes of limitation. Moreover, the court found that the characterization of &sect; 2A:14-1.1 as a statute of repose was not necessarily accurate. Therefore, the court held that defendants' reliance upon &sect; 2A:14-1.1 was precluded. Accordingly, the judgment was reversed and the case remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff director of buildings and grounds contended that he was wrongfully terminated, via constructive discharge, from his position by reason of his political affiliation. Plaintiff sought punitive damages as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. Giving plaintiff the benefit of all favorable testimony and legitimate inferences, the jury could reasonably have found that defendants conspired to deprive plaintiff of his constitutional rights. The trial court committed error when it aborted trial and dismissed plaintiff's claim for punitive damages. The trial court acted correctly when it granted defendant's motion for an involuntary dismissal. Plaintiff presented a prima facie case against defendants. Accepting as true all evidence that supported plaintiff's claim, the court found that reasonable minds could have differed regarding whether defendants entered into an unlawful conspiracy to deprive plaintiff of his civil rights. The events created a substantial enough possibility of a conspiracy to have defeated defendants' motions for an involuntary dismissal. Therefore, sufficient evidence of an evil motive required submission of the question of punitive damages to the jury.</SPAN></P>

IV or N.J. Const. art. I., para. 7, because the invasion of privacy was occasioned by the private action of the informant. The court held that there was sufficient evidence that defendants operated a controlled dangerous substance production facility because &quot;rerocking&quot; cocaine fell within N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-2's definition of &quot;manufacture.&quot; The court held that an uncertified school zone map was properly authenticated for the purpose of N.J. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments of conviction in all respects. The court held that the observation by a police officer of illegal conduct through a basement common wall at the invitation of a tenant informant was not an unconstitutional warrantless search because the officer's observations went no further than that of the informant's in infringing upon defendants' privacy.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought review of the lower court's order that defendant complete applications required by respondent's order and imposing a fine. The court affirmed the decision, holding that defendant lacked standing to assert that the FWPA was unconstitutional because appellant's outcome in the litigation did not depend on the constitutional question. The court held that the verification of the complaint could be made on information and belief. The court held defendant had a right to contest the validity of the order at an administrative hearing but, having failed to do so, was barred from challenging the factual predicates underlying it.

The property of the employer was extensively damaged by fire, and operations temporality stopped. Appellant applied for unemployment compensation benefits.

The court found that appellant was ineligible for benefits by reason of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 43:21-19(m)(1). Under &sect; 43:21-19(m)(1), an officer of a corporation or a person that owned more than 5 percent of the stock or debt interest of a corporate employer was ineligible during the term of office or ownership. Appellant was both an officer and an owner in excess of 5 percent. Appellant contended that &sect; 43:21-19(m)(1) deprived him of equal protection of the laws because it treated him differently than other claimants without a reason.

The tax system allocated equally among the various municipalities the burden of development of the Hackensack Meadowlands. The trial court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint. The court reversed. The court held that res judicata did not bar plaintiffs' complaint. The court reviewed the merits of the complaint. The court held that the prospective application of the amendment of the Hackensack Meadowlands Reclamation and Development Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:17, which was designed to eliminate the compounding effect of the tax system, was proper and evidenced by legislative intent. The court held that the tax system was not arbitrary, but rather applied the same standards to all municipalities. The court held payments made in lieu of real property taxes were not required to be considered in calculating tax sharing obligations. The court also held that the involvement of federal agencies for the preservation of wetlands did not preempt regulatory authority from defendant. The court held the marshaled wetlands were of insignificant acreage in light of the whole project.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fair Automobile Insurance Reform Act, at N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:30A-16b and 17:33B-51, imposed surtaxes and assessments upon state insurers and others to satisfy obligations accumulated by an underwriting association. Pursuant to the statutory scheme, affiliates of appellants paid surtaxes and assessments. Thereafter, appellant insurance company filed its pass-through rate request for approval pursuant to N.J. Admin. Code tit. 11, &sect; 3-16.11 seeking to revise its private passenger automobile rates to cover surtaxes and assessments imposed under the applicable statute. Respondent Commissioner of Insurance denied recovery. On appeal, the court found no merit in respondent's contention that limitation to prospective application was warranted by reason of appellant's asserted delay in filing its pass-through application. The court held that respondent erred when it denied appellant's application because it expressed a blanket finding that respondent could not engage in ratemaking. The court also remanded the action so that respondent could set forth the reasons why the approval was denied for pass through of assessments imposed on appellant's non-auto lines of business.</SPAN></P>

Appellant demanded an amendment requiring that political-activity deductions only be required for nonmembers who object. Under the existing regulation the representative body was required to deduct the political-activity portion of the fee as to all nonmembers, not just those nonmembers who affirmatively object. PERC denied the petition on the ground that the regulation was required under the leading case. The lower court decision was affirmed. The court held that the leading case was clear, and that appellee's regulation was a reasonable implementation of that holding. The regulations at issue departed from the literal language of the statute at issue. However, the statute must now be read as construed by the court. The legislature had not sought to amend the law to require nonmembers to object, despite the lapse of six years since the adoption of the regulation implementing the decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent township enacted an ordinance banning cigarette vending machines. Plaintiffs, owners and operators of cigarette vending machines, challenged the legality of the ordinance on the grounds of preemption and equal protection. Plaintiffs claimed the area of law had been preempted by the legislature when it enacted N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:170-51 which prohibited the sale of cigarettes to minors and N.J. Stat. Ann. 18A:36-32 which prohibited vending machines on school property. Plaintiff further contended that a less restrictive means of preventing unrestricted access to vending machines could have been enacted. The court reversed and remanded for entry of a final judgment dismissing the complaint. The prohibition on the vending machines was rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest to satisfy equal protection and substantive due process concerns.</SPAN></P>

The court examined the rule regarding the validity of an administrative agency's regulations and concluded that the regulations enacted were not ultra vires.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fair Automobile Insurance Reform Act of 1990 (the FAIR Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:33B-1 et seq., imposed surtaxes and assessments on insurers to pay half the cost of erasing the deficit of an insurance association fund but required that insurers not pass these charges through to their insureds. Respondent Commissioner of Insurance promulgated a regulation, N.J. Admin. Code tit. 11, &sect; 3-20.5, under the Excess Profit Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:29A-5.6 to -5.16, which excluded the surcharges from expenses that the insurers could deduct in calculating their profits. Appellant insurers challenged the regulation. The court affirmed, stating that it would not substitute its judgment regarding the wisdom of an administrative action for the agency's judgment as long as the action was statutorily authorized and reasonable. The court read the FAIR Act and the Excess Profit Law together and held that respondent clearly had both the mandate and the authority to pass the regulation, which was not a confiscatory taking because it allowed the surtaxes and assessments to be treated as expenses upon a showing that such treatment was necessary to earn a constitutionally adequate rate of return.</SPAN></P>

The state alleged that the company was a fraudulently operated pyramid scheme that constituted an illegal lottery in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:37-2. Defendants, operators and police officers, were convicted by a jury of offenses including promoting gambling, theft, conspiracy, and official misconduct. Defendants argued that their convictions for running an illegal lottery should be reversed and the court agreed, holding that a pyramid scheme, however fraudulently run, was not a &quot;lottery&quot; within the meaning of the statute. In reversing defendant operators' gambling related convictions, the court ruled that given the judge's instructions in the case, the court could not conclude that the jury found defendants guilty on any basis other than their wrongdoing in connection with a lottery. Defendant operators' other convictions were affirmed. The convictions of defendant police officers, who provided security for the investment company, were reversed because they could not be convicted of official misconduct in allowing and facilitating the conduct of an illegal lottery where a pyramid scheme did not constitute an illegal lottery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners and managers association requested that defendant township provide solid waste collection services at each apartment complex curbsides or from dumpsters inside the complexes. All of the streets within the complexes were privately owned and many did not meet municipal specifications. In an oral decision, the trial court required defendant to provide collection to plaintiffs and left the method of collection to the discretion of defendant. N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:66-1b became effective the next day, and the trial court allowed plaintiffs to attack the constitutionality of the statute. The trial court upheld the statute, and the court affirmed. The court found that the statute did not exclude any class of residents from receiving municipal solid waste collection. The statute simply did not mandate the customized type of service requested by plaintiffs. The classification between collection on public and private streets was rationally related to the legitimate governmental objective of safety and cost containment, and the evidence failed to establish that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court, holding that the challenged statute giving municipalities discretionary power to limit solid waste collection service to curbside collection along public streets was constitutional because the statute did not exclude any class of residents from services and the restriction was rationally related to the legitimate governmental objectives of safety and cost containment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, township and mayor, enacted Township of Parsippany-Troy Hills, N.J., Ordinance 91:10 requiring members of plaintiff property owners and managers association to refund to residents any tax refunds or reductions received. The court affirmed the order declaring the ordinance unconstitutional. The purpose of the ordinance was the prevention of windfall profits to property owners, but there was no means of determining whether such profits existed. The ordinance took money belonging to property owners and distributed it to tenants without establishing a basis to support tenant's right to the funds. Without the structure of rent control, there was no way of knowing whether property owners were receiving sufficient rent to provide a profit. The court held that the ordinance standing without a rent control ordinance required a legislative or state constitutional source for the power. The statement that tenants paid property taxes through rent was merely an abstract principle, and it did not prove the foundation necessary for municipal action. The court was not shown why invoking such municipal police powers were reasonably required by local conditions in defendant township.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was injured while traveling in a vehicle in New Jersey. The vehicle was registered and insured in Delaware. Plaintiff sought personal injury protection benefits from defendant over and above the amount provided in defendant's insurance policy issued to plaintiff. Under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:28-1.4, any insurer authorized to do business in New Jersey was required to include New Jersey personal injury protection coverage in policies sold in another state whenever the vehicle insured under the policy was operated in New Jersey. The court held that the statute applied and provided additional personal injury protection benefits to plaintiff. The court cited the legitimate interest of New Jersey in its insurance scheme. There was no due process violation, because in a multistate transaction such as the one at issue, New Jersey had a legitimate interest in protecting its citizens, thus making N.J. Stat.

The instruction given by the trial court permitted conviction under &sect; 2C:35-3 merely if defendant initiated, supervised, financed, or managed a two-person conspiracy to produce or sell any quantity of the specified illegal drugs. The instruction failed to state, and further to define for the jury, that the prosecution was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was an &quot;upper echelon member&quot; of a drug organization, not just a street-level vendor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent physician filed suit against appellant anti-abortionist protestors, seeking damages and injunctive relief for picketing in an harassing manner outside respondent's residence. The trial court dismissed the damages claim but entered a permanent injunction against pickets or demonstrations by appellant and its cohorts within 300 feet of respondent's residence. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that there was no violation of the separation of powers doctrine because the trial court had the inherent equitable power to issue the injunction to protect the right to residential privacy under either state or federal concepts of police power without a finding that appellant had committed a crime or tort. The injunction was content-neutral in intent and was a proper regulation because there was a significant government interest at stake, despite the 300-foot restriction on expression of a particular viewpoint. The restriction preserved ample alternative channels of communication at the clinics where respondent performed abortions, and was narrowly tailored because the problem that was remedied, intrusion into residential tranquility, was created by the picketing itself.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that appellee qualified for status as &quot;holder in due course&quot; and was therefore guaranteed to be free of all personal defenses.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:64-5. The court reversed and remanded the case and held that under the statute, a perfected security interest held by one with no knowledge of the proscribed activity was exempt from forfeiture, and that under the innocent owner's defense, those who took an interest in property that was not prima facie contraband, even after an illegal use, could still have their interest exempt from forfeiture. The court further held that the proper inquiry into whether an interest holder had knowledge of the act upon which the forfeiture was based should include whether the interest holder did what reasonably could have been expected to find out if the property had been illegally used.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings and held that the forfeiture statute protected appellant bail bondsman who in good faith and without knowledge of wrongdoing took an interest in property and did what reasonably could have been expected to find out if property had been illegally used.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for possession of cocaine, distribution of cocaine, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute within 1,000 feet of school property, and employing a juvenile in a drug distribution scheme. The court rejected defendant's claim that the state should have had to disclose the location of the surveillance point from which an officer witnessed defendant's involvement in a drug exchange. The court noted that defendant cross-examined the officer at trial regarding all of the factors which could have obscured his view and that any further examination would have pinpointed the location, thus jeopardizing ongoing operations as well as the public safety and personal safety of the officers. However, the court reversed defendant's conviction for employing a juvenile in a drug distribution scheme, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-6, because the trial court misstated the law with respect to determination of who controlled the drug transaction involving an adult and a juvenile.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporations paid $ 8,142,094.00 in taxes to the New Jersey Spill Fund. During remand proceedings ordered by the supreme court, plaintiffs moved for an order mandating a full refund of those Spill Fund taxes which were pre-empted by CERCLA. Plaintiffs argued that a recent holding of the United States Supreme Court required a modification of the remedy fashioned by the supreme court. The lower court ruled that it was obliged to follow strictly the mandate of the state supreme court and refused to modify it in any way. On appeal, the court affirmed the order of the lower court, holding that only portions of the Spill Fund were expressly pre-empted by CERCLA. Thus, the court held that the taxes paid by plaintiffs during the pre-emption period were valid as levies to fund those Spill Fund objectives that were determined not to have been pre-empted under federal law. Therefore, the court concluded that plaintiffs had no enforceable claim to a refund of any portion of the funds as long as all Spill Fund revenues expended for pre-empted purposes during the period of pre-emption were returned to the fund from general revenues within a reasonable time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the state both challenged the decision of the Superior Court, Atlantic County (New Jersey), which affirmed defendant's conviction of driving while intoxicated, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:4-50. The appellate court held that defendant's conviction for refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:4-50.4a, could be considered in imposing second offender status but refused to impose the punishment for his second violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was first convicted for refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:4-50.4a. He was then convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:4-50. At sentencing, the trial judge refused to impose second offender status under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:4-50(a)(2) on defendant based on his refusal conviction. On appeal, the DWI conviction was affirmed. The appellate court held that while the refusal conviction could be considered for second offender status, a mandatory prison term could not be constitutionally imposed for the second violation. The defendant appealed and the state cross-appealed. The court held that the refusal conviction could not be a basis for imposing second offender status. The court held that an interpretation of &sect; 39:4-50(a)(2) that treated a prior violation of the refusal statute as a first offense ignored the different burdens of proof of each one. Section 39:4-50 was quasi-criminal in nature and required guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, whereas &sect; 39:4-50(a) was civil in nature and required proof by a preponderance of the evidence. Thus, the court reversed the lower court's decision and reinstated the original judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the ordinance, which on its face did not have a functional standard, was unconstitutional.

On review, the court found that the summary judgment dismissing plaintiff individual's claim was correct because he was not authorized to sue to collect the commission. Further, because the necessary elements for tortious interference with a prospective advantage were not proved, the trial court should have granted defendant purchaser's request for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.

It held that collateral estoppel did not apply because one head used the same antlers involved in the 1990 action, adding that the clear language of the statute, the lack of legislative history and prior court decisions, and the concerns the statute addressed all militated against the application of collateral estoppel as well. Moreover, it noted, there was no indication of what grounds the 1990 court relied upon in acquitting defendant. It rejected defendant's argument that the statute did not apply to deer that were not native to New Jersey, finding that the modifying phrase in question referred only to birds, as well as his argument that the skin of a deer was not a body part under the statute. It found no merit to his claims that he had been selectively prosecuted or that the statute was overbroad and vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding that the civil penalty proceeding against defendant, who was found to have illegally offered for sale two deer heads, was not barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel, the court affirmed the lower court's decision that he had violated the statute. It also found that the heads were covered under the statute, that defendant had not been selectively prosecuted, and that the statute was not vague or overbroad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insurers appealed orders from defendant Commissioner of Insurance (New Jersey), implementing and enforcing the Fair Automobile Insurance Reform Act of 1990, (FAIRA), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:33B-1 to -63. At issue were the actions taken by defendant to effectuate the producer assignment program mandated by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:33B-9c.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Commissioner of Insurance issued orders establishing a voluntary producer placement plan in implementation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:33B-9b and a mandatory producer assignment program in implementation of &sect; 17:33B-9c. Plaintiff insurers attacked N.J. Admin. Code tit. 11, &sect; 3-42.12, which required them to enter into contractual relationships with assigned producers. The court held that this hybrid form of insurer representative, which lacked the element of binding authority, was of limited duration, and might be predicated on an enforceable scheme of indemnification of the insurer for other imputable acts of the representative, did not clearly implicate the basic constitutional and statutory considerations underlying plaintiffs' fundamental challenge. The constraints imposed upon plaintiffs' self-determination by having to contract with the producers in the manner prescribed was not an unconstitutional taking. Plaintiffs were bound by the &quot;take all comers&quot; requirement of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:33B-1 to -63, thus they were necessarily required to accept the applications of all eligible persons. The court held that defendant's actions conformed to statutory authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the general validity of orders of defendant Commissioner of Insurance appealed from on the ground that the clarified status of the producers imposed little more onus on plaintiff insurers than the &quot;take all comers&quot; provision itself of the Fair Automobile Insurance Reform Act of 1990. The court was satisfied that defendant's actions were in conformance with his statutory authority.</SPAN></P>

His license could be revived under the consent order to which he had agreed and also under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 45:6-7. Therefore, due process principles applied to respondent's proceedings. Although it was not directly applicable, under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:14B-2 the proceedings were a contested case, to which the Administrative Procedure Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:14B-1 et seq. (APA), applied. Appellant was entitled to various procedural rights under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:14B-9. Respondent had not relied on appellant's own testimony in reaching in reaching its conclusions. Further, the statutes upon which it did rely did not apply. The court held that the lack of adequate notice, the lack of the opportunity to confront witnesses, and the failure to comply with the APA required a reversal and a remand for a new hearing.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that it was denied due process because no claim had been asserted against it, that Maryland law should control because it was domiciled therein, and that the theory of successor corporate liability was not viable and did not apply. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that where appellant had notice and an opportunity to be heard no due process rights were violated, and that New Jersey had the most significant interest in the litigation. It also held that appellant was strictly liable under the successor corporate liability theory, where in the transfer it received all assets and information related to the manufacture of radial arm saws.

The court reversed the attempted murder conviction and remanded. The court held that the trial court gave the jury improper instructions on the attempted murder charge.

The court held that defendant could only be found guilty of attempted murder if he acted purposely. However, the court affirmed defendant's other convictions. The court held that the jury instruction on the defense of pathological intoxication was correct. The court held that the defense was only available if defendant was exposed to a pesticide and that alone altered defendant's mind. The court held involuntary intoxication did not occur if the pesticide was mixed with illegal drugs defendant voluntarily consumed prior to the crimes. The court held that the cross examination of defendant's expert about the jury verdict in a murder trial with a similar defense asserted of pesticide induced behavior was proper, as defendant's counsel misled the jury about that case's outcome.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the denial of his motion to suppress by the Superior Court of New Jersey, Burlington County, during his trial for driving while intoxicated. Defendant contended that the roadside safety check in which police stopped him violated his rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV and N.J. Const. art. I, para. 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police department conducted a &quot;roadside safety check&quot; in which police stopped every fifth car, or any car with obvious safety problems. Police stopped defendant's truck because it was the fifth in line. Police found defendant intoxicated and charged him with driving while intoxicated (DWI). The municipal court denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence of his intoxication. The trial court also denied the motion to suppress and found him guilty, but the trial court stayed the judgment pending appeal. The court reversed and remanded. The court held that police did not &quot;randomly&quot; stop vehicles at the unbridled discretion of police officers. The court found that the state presented no evidence to support the balance of legitimate governmental interests in its favor as opposed to the intrusion on defendant's rights under U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury returned a verdict in favor of defendant putative father in a paternity action filed by the mother under prior N.J.

The paternity action by the mother made the same allegation (defendant was the child's father), sought essentially the same relief (an adjudication of paternity and the entry of a support order against defendant), and was actually litigated through trial and an appeal. The court determined that the child was in privity with her mother as required under collateral estoppel because although the child was not a named party in the first action, a proceeding under prior N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the state bar association, appealed an order of the Tax Court of New Jersey (New Jersey) that upheld as constitutional Section 67 of the Fair Automobile Insurance Reform Act of 1990, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:33B-62, which assessed a fee on practicing attorneys.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant assessed a fee, via Section 67 of the Fair Automobile Insurance Reform Act (&quot;Act&quot;) of 1990, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:33B-62, on attorneys practicing law in the state in order to pay off the debt created in the current insurance system so as to convert the citizens to a voluntary insurance market. Plaintiff, the state bar association, objected to the fee. The trial court affirmed the fee statute but exempted certain attorneys who the court held were not actively practicing law. The court affirmed, but included from exemption of the fee those attorneys barred from the practice of law by the constitution or statute, such as judges and judicial law clerks. The court held that the Act did not violate plaintiff's equal protection rights because the Act was rationally related to the state interest of insurance reform. The court found that assessing a fee on attorneys was rational because that profession benefited under the insurance system. However, the court found that certain attorneys were exempt from the fee because the statute required fee assessment only of those actively practicing law, and certain attorneys having a law license were not actively practicing law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order, with modification, that permitted the assessment of a statutory fee on attorneys because the statute was rationally related to the state interest of insurance reform where the profession of law benefited under the insurance system. The court modified the order by exempting those attorneys not actively practicing law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Essex County (New Jersey), convicting defendant of third-degree theft by receiving stolen property and two counts of second-degree reckless manslaughter. Defendant was sentenced on the theft charge to a term of five years, and he was sentenced to concurrent terms of ten years on the manslaughter convictions, consecutively served with the theft sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers chased a stolen vehicle driven by defendant. During the chase, the vehicle driven by defendant proceeded through a red light and collided into the driver's side of another vehicle. Both vehicles flew into the air on impact. Defendant's passenger and the driver of the other vehicle were both killed in the collision. Defendant argued that he was not the driver of the stolen vehicle. He also filed a motion for acquittal on the theft charge, but it was denied. Defendant was convicted of third-degree theft by receiving stolen property and second-degree reckless manslaughter. He was sentenced on the theft charge to a term of five years. On the manslaughter convictions, he was sentenced to concurrent terms of ten years, to be consecutively served with the theft sentence. The court held that the motion for acquittal was properly denied as to theft because the jury could infer from defendant's conduct that that he was seeking to elude police because of his knowledge that the vehicle was stolen. However, the manslaughter convictions were reversed and the case remanded for a new trial because the jury instructions did not accurately reflect the statutory law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's theft conviction and sentence were affirmed based on defendant's lack of permission to operate the movable property of another, and there was no trial court error because the evidence supported the findings of fact. However, the manslaughter convictions were reversed because the jury was not appropriately apprised of the quantitatively greater recklessness contemplated for manslaughter than that required for death by auto.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged the judgment that granted acquittals in favor of appellees on charges of racketeering, bribery, official misconduct, and making gifts to public servants. The state alleged that appellees, in return for money, influenced the Atlantic City Zoning Board to act favorably on certain commercial land use proposals. The trial court held that because appellees were not members of the zoning board, they had no power to act in matters before the board. The state argued that the double jeopardy clause did not protect appellees because the trial court's determination was not based on factual insufficiencies in the state's case. The court dismissed the state's appeal and held that the Double Jeopardy Clause of U.S. Const. amend. V. barred the retrial of appellees. The court held that the trial judge measured the state's evidence against its interpretation of the statutory elements and found the state's proofs to be inadequate. The court held that the disposition was an adjudication on the merits and was unappealable by the state.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the act was underinclusive, and violative of equal-protection guarantees. On appeal, plaintiffs argued that the act's distinction between apartment owners and condominium owners was irrational because a significant percentage of condominium owners also rent their units, thus making them similarly situated to apartment owners. However, the court found that the act's main purpose, to relieve condominium owners of the burden of paying twice for municipal services, was a valid legislative purpose. Furthermore, even though the act grouped all condominium co-owners without distinguishing between resident and non-resident owners, most owners satisfied act's intended purpose. Therefore, there was a rational basis for the legislation. The trial court's judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected petitioner's contentions, finding that the board's conclusion concerning negative impact was proper because of the long term effect upon the racial balance and educational quality at respondent's high school. The court noted that the relevant statute required denial of severance once a negative impact was found, and that it did not permit a balancing of negative and positive impacts. The court held that the denial of severance was not unconstitutional because the state was permitted to consider race in its educational decisions. The court noted that the board found the petition for severance was motivated by racial prejudice. Accordingly, the court affirmed the board's determination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were indicted with conspiracy, theft by deception, and swindling and cheating at casino gambling. The trial court denied defendants' motions for suppression of hotel billing records and other evidence arising out of an investigation into a card-shuffling scheme. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the hotel's telephone billing records were not illegally obtained by a police officer. Even if evidence of improper motive was present, subjective bad motive did not invalidate a warrantless seizure that was objectively reasonable. Further, the evidence demonstrated that a hotel clerk's actions were not sufficiently influenced by the police officer to require the conclusion that she was a state actor. The officer was neither present when the clerk printed out the telephone record nor did he direct or encourage her to do so. The court stated that swindlers could be prosecuted under the Casino Control Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5:12-1 et seq., and face 18 months and a fine of up to $ 25,000, or they could be prevented from achieving economic windfall by prosecution for theft-by-deception under Title 2A.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner insurance company sought declaratory relief as to whether an insurer was entitled to a hearing on its request for an exemption, abatement, or deferral under the Fair Automobile Insurance Reform Act of 1990 (FAIR act), N.J.

The act empowered the commissioner of insurance to exempt, abate or defer an assessment if an insurer is at risk because of its unsafe or unsound financial condition.

An inspectors retrieved the object, which turned out to be a folded bill containing a white powdery substance, stipulated at trial to be cocaine. Defendant was indicted for third-degree possession of cocaine, but the state downgraded the charge to the disorderly persons offense. Following a bench trial, defendant was found guilty. However, on defendant's motion, the judge arrested the judgment, concluding that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-10c&nbsp;unconstitutionally infringed on the privilege against self-incrimination. The state appealed, and a second judge reinstated the conviction, finding that the statute was constitutional if read to provide for use and fruits immunity. Defendant appealed from that judgment arguing that plaintiff's appeal should have been dismissed because the court was the correct appellate venue. The judgment on appeal was reversed, and the earlier order for acquittal was reinstated as whatever route, the issue would have been before the court, and that the statute on the privilege against self-incrimination was a full defense to the prosecution.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the prosecution failed to prove that the school building within 1,000 feet of the offense was used for school purposes as required by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-7. The court affirmed the conviction for possession with intent to distribute within 1,000 feet of school property, holding that the map introduced into evidence that labelled the building as a school created a permissive inference from which the jury, absent evidence to the contrary, could properly find that it was used for school purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for possession of marijuana, possession with the intent to distribute, aggravated assault upon a police officer, and second degree escape after a traffic stop. The court granted defendant's motion to suppress the marijuana evidence solely on the charges of possession and intent to distribute and the state's motion to dismiss the marijuana charges. Defendant was convicted of aggravated assault upon a police officer and resisting arrest. The court affirmed the convictions. The court held that even though evidence was obtained in violation of U.S. Const. amend IV, it had been properly admitted as to the non-drug charges because defendant had admitted to attempting to escape police detention. The court held that although defendant had no notice before trial of the charge of resisting arrest, a valid waiver was found where defense counsel had participated in the decision and then expressed consent to the charge on the record. The court held that merger was improper because the offense of aggravated assault was concerned with physical protection of police officers and the offense of resisting arrest was to prevent persons from resisting police apprehension.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for aggravated assault upon a police officer and resisting arrest because evidence of defendant's possession of marijuana, which was excluded with respect to defendant's drug charges upon a finding that the search was unlawful, was admissible in the trial of offenses that occurred after the stop and search were effected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city and county board sought review of a decision of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Hudson County, which held that a statute permitting the county board to exempt the city from assessment of taxes relating to the funding of a county vocational school district was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New Jersey passed N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:54-37, which had the effect of exempting the taxpayers of only defendant city from contributing to the support of their county vocational school district. To accommodate the exemption, defendant county board adopted a two-tiered county tax rate, the higher rate for its municipalities, the lower rate for defendant city. Numerous municipalities filed suit and the trial court found the statute unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed, noting that if the responsibility for the state function were assigned to local government, the local tax must fall uniformly upon all taxable property within the county or the municipality as per N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, paras. 1 and 2. The court noted that they were not dealing with an exemption of real property from taxation; they were dealing with a lack of uniformity caused by excusing defendant city from having to pay its proportionate share of the cost of a budget item. The court held that the statute that excused the city from funding the county vocational school district was unconstitutional because it permitted lack of uniformity in taxing taxpayers their proportional share of budget items.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, for different reasons than the trial judge, that exception of defendant city from taxes for that portion of the budget relating to county vocational school district was unconstitutional. The court found that the tax exemption was in violation of the state constitution's tax uniformity provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the order of the Superior Court of Camden County (New Jersey), which found that defendant had violated conditions of his probation and imposed the maximum base term and the mandatory minimum sentence for defendant's earlier conviction for violating N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-7. Defendant was not given credit for time spent on parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the sentence that was imposed after his probation was revoked and the fact that he was not given credit for time spent on parole. The court ordered the trial court to vacate the mandatory minimum term, impose a four-year prison term in lieu of the maximum five-year base term imposed, and for provision that defendant be given credit for jail time and parole time served under the 364-day sentence originally imposed as a condition of his probation. The court held that on resentencing, defendant was entitled to the benefit of the state's waiver of the statutory minimum mandatory term because he was not told that the waiver was conditional. The court held that the record did not support imposition of the maximum base term. The pecuniary-incentive factor was inappropriately applied because it rested solely on the charge of possession with intent to distribute, and the deterrence factor did not sufficiently outweigh the mitigating factor of no prior criminal activity. Finally, the court held that parole was a continuation of custody and that both jail time and parole time counted toward service of the prison term imposed on the resentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case for vacation of the mandatory minimum term, because defendant was not informed that the state's waiver at the original sentencing was conditional, and imposition of a four-year prison term, because the record did not support imposition of the maximum base term. Defendant was entitled to credit for time served on parole because parole was a continuation of custody, not a termination of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
