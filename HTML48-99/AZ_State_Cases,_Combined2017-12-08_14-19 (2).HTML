</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner's husband was killed in an accident that occurred when he was driving a bus route between states from a home terminal in another state where he was paid and lived with his family. Petitioner sought worker's compensation, and the commission found that the deceased was covered by the workmen's compensation provisions of the other state and concluded that it was without jurisdiction to entertain petitioner's claim because the decedent was not regularly employed in the state. Petitioner appealed from the determination, and the court affirmed the decision. The court held that the decedent was employed within the meaning of the statute but that application of the state's workmen's compensation laws would constitute an undue burden on interstate commerce. The court declined jurisdiction on the basis that to require worker's compensation coverage in situations where the deceased was covered by another state's system would impose an undue burden on interstate commerce by requiring employers to pay multiple premiums in states in which they had employees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant had taken possession of a lead mine in Mexico pursuant to a contract to purchase the mine from the decedent. A Mexican court appointed a foreign administrator and had authorized the administrator to take possession of the mine. The claimant filed suit in Arizona to enforce the contract.

The court reversed all aspects of the judgment and the injunction which affected the foreign administrator in his individual and representative capacity and held that the trial court erred in assuming personal jurisdiction over the foreign administrator. The court affirmed the judgment and injunction against the other heirs and administrator. The court held that the trial court did not err in granting a default judgment for specific performance of the contract as a sanction for the heirs' willful refusal to comply with discovery orders because the claimant was prejudiced by the delay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction by the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) following a jury trial for driving a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of 1950 Ariz. Sess. Laws 1st Spec. Sess. ch. 3, &sect; 54, appearing as &sect; 66-156 (Cum. Supp. 1952). The trial court denied defendant's motion for dismissal. Defendant alleged error in the jury instructions, which paraphrased &sect; 66-156.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A highway patrolman stopped defendant's car, which was weaving over the road at an excessive speed. The patrolman testified that defendant exhibited signs of alcohol intoxication and that he admitted to drinking. Defendant gave written permission for a blood-alcohol test, which showed a level of 0.20 percent. Defendant objected to the trial court's jury instructions, which included portions of &sect; 66-156, and instructed the jury that upon proof of a certain alcohol content in the blood, defendant was presumed to have been under the influence. On appeal, the court affirmed. The jury instructions correctly instructed the jury on the elements of the offense and the State's burden of proof to show beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was driving under the influence. The trial judge's reading of the statute in the jury instructions was exclusively a statement of law and did not constitute his opinion on the evidence contrary to Ariz. Const. art. 6, &sect; 12. The presumption of intoxication based on blood-alcohol content under &sect; 66-156 had a rational connection to facts established by medical science, and did not change the burden of proof or violate defendant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for driving a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on a complaint by some property owners, the superior court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining and restraining the city from considering petitions for annexing property or from passing any resolution or ordinance with the purpose of annexing any territory on the basis of the petitions. The city asked the court for a writ of prohibition to restrain the superior court judges from enforcing the temporary restraining order. The superior court judges contended that Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26-104 (1939), which conferred upon municipalities in Arizona the power to annex territory, contained an implied condition that the petition itself describe or delineate the territory to be annexed. The court made the writ of prohibition permanent. The court held that: (1) if the court read into the statute by implication the requirement that the petitions had to define the area, the court would thereby, to a substantial degree, dissipate the city's discretionary powers expressly given; and (2) such a construction would leave the city commission with only two choices, either to permit applicants for annexation to define the city's boundaries or to forego the right of expansion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff State of Arizona, upon the relation of the Attorney General, brought an original action in quo warranto asking that the court adjudge defendant appointee as not entitled to hold or enjoy the office of state senator from Apache County, Arizona. The State also sought, pursuant to Ariz. Code Ann. &sect; 28-301 (1939), a judgment of ouster against the appointee, who had been appointed by the governor for a short term, effective November 2, 1953.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to a proposed 1953 amendment to Ariz. Const. art. IV, pt. 2, &sect; 1(1), the State Senate had been composed of 19 members, with one being from Apache County. The amendment stated that the Senate shall consist of two members from each county. When it appeared that the amendment had been carried by a majority at special election, the governor issued a proclamation declaring it to be law. He apparently considered that there was a newly-created additional office and that he was empowered to fill the vacancy. The court found that when the appointee took an oath of office pursuant to a purported appointment by the governor, entered Senate chambers, and claimed to be a duly qualified senator, he became more than a mere volunteer or interloper. He thus brought himself within the terms of Ariz. Code Ann. &sect; 28-301 (1939) as one who &quot;usurps, intrudes into or who unlawfully holds or exercises any public office.&quot; The court was convinced that the appointee purported to hold a nonexistent term of office. Finding that the amendment did not create a &quot;short term&quot; and that the new term set forth in the amendment had not yet come into existence, the court held that there was no vacancy to be filled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered judgment for the State. The appointee was ordered ousted and excluded from the State Senate.</SPAN></P>

Each unit was served by the district, with electrical energy for lighting, etc. As a condition precedent to such service, the district demanded from the company a connection charge of $ 25 per unit, which was paid. The company claimed that the service charge was prohibited by Az. Code Ann. &sect; 76-109 (1939), which stated that any public service corporation demanding and receiving a deposit of money from any consumer shall have paid to such consumer eight percent interest per annum thereon. The district claimed that it was not subject to &sect; 76-109 because it was a political subdivision and municipal corporation. The court held that the district was either at all times a political subdivision of the state, or it never was. In the case at bar, the district, which was incorporated within the Constitution of Arizona in 1940, was not a public service corporation. Consequently, &sect; 76-109 had no application to the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In petitioner company's action against respondent State Treasurer of the State of Arizona seeking a peremptory writ of mandamus ordering the state treasurer to pay a warrant issued by the state auditor, the court addressed the reasons why it ordered the writ to issue and why it found that the Financial Administration Act of 1953 was unconstitutional by violating Ariz. Const. art. V, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company sought a writ to compel the state treasurer to pay a warrant issued by the state auditor to the company in payment of tires. After the act's enactment, state purchases had to be made through the state purchasing agent, as did all supply contracts made by the commissioner of finance appointed under the act. The act also declared void all contracts otherwise made. Section 10(a) of the Act stated that the auditor was to be under the supervision of the commissioner of finance. The court confirmed the order that directed the issuance of the writ. The Act violated the Arizona Constitution because it attempted to destroy the constitutional office of auditor and frustrated the purpose of the office. A constitutional officer's powers could not be removed indirectly or directly. Ariz. Const. art. IX, &sect; 5, precluded any state expenditure except as provided by law, and Ariz. Const. art. V, &sect; 1, provided that state money could only be spent on claims audited by the constitutional auditor. The Act's severability clause was useless because the valid and invalid parts of the Act were inextricably entwined and interdependent in subject matter, purpose, and meaning.</SPAN></P>

The Board sought a re-examination of the question of the constitutionality of the statutes affected by the prior opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The barber alleged that the enforcement of a statute that related to price fixing was unconstitutional. The court found no rational relationship between the price fixing and the preservation of the public health, safety, and general welfare. The cause was remanded to the trial court wherein the motion for judgment on the pleadings was granted. The Board claimed that the court was without jurisdiction to entertain the former appeal because no appealable order had been entered and that the former opinion disposed of the constitutional question without any facts from which it could be determined whether the price fixing provisions were reasonably related to the public health, safety, and welfare. The court affirmed. The questioned order was a direct order of dismissal, which was appealable. The constitutionality of a statute could be determined by considering its language and the material facts of which the court could take judicial notice. It was not the province of the court to examine evidence for the purpose of deciding a question, which the legislature had already decided. It's function was to determine whether the legislative decision was without rational basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, the Superior Court of Maricopa County and a judge, sought to quash a writ of prohibition requiring respondents to refrain from action in a suit involving the appointment of a conservator for a company. Petitioners, judgment creditors and a creditor of the company, sought the writ alleging that Ariz. Code Ann. &sect; 53-1416(3) (Cum. Supp. 1939), which gave the superior court authority to appoint the conservator, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners alleged that the appointed conservator was arbitrarily paying some creditors and denying claims of other creditors of the company. Petitioners sought to have the property of the company released from the superior court's jurisdiction. The court amended the writ and ordered it to be permanent. The court held as follows: (1) assuming the unconstitutionality of &sect; 53-1416(3) before it was amended, the superior court had no power to appoint a conservator and permit him to take possession of the company's properties; (2) the subsequent amendment to &sect; 53-1416(3) did not have the effect of validating the original appointment for the reason that it was only remedial in character; (3) the superior court had, without jurisdiction, appointed the so-called conservator and turned over to him certain properties of the company; and (4) common justice demanded that so far as possible the property was to be restored to its legal position prior to the appointment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the writ to restrain respondents from taking any further proceedings in the action except such as was necessary to preserve the properties in its custody, to discover those entitled thereto, and to make restitution so far as legally possible. The court ordered the writ be made permanent as so amended.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Intervenor land and irrigation company appealed an order from a trial court (Arizona), which dismissed the company's complaint in intervention, which complaint in intervention had theretofore been filed in an action between plaintiffs, canal and water companies, and defendant water users' association. The association was but one of over 5000 defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purpose of the original litigation was to determine the rights of the canal company, water company, and users' association in and to the waters of a river system. The company, by its complaint in intervention, alleged that it had certain rights in to the river. Parties on both sides sought to dismiss the complaint in intervention and the trial court granted the motion. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court was sitting for the very purpose of determining the extent, priorities, and status of the company's claimed rights. When no proof was offered on the extent of appropriation, that is, the quantity of water beneficially used and the particular lands upon which used, the motion to dismiss was presented and there was nothing for the trial court to do other than dismiss the complaint. No evidence having been offered as to the extent of the company's claimed appropriation, the trial court was not in a position to determine whether the company had made an appropriation nor could it determine its priority or status even if it were assumed that the appropriation could have been or was made under any of the suggested or claimed methods of appropriation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment dismissing the irrigation company's complaint in intervention.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city opened bids for a contract to construct a water tank. An out-of-state contractor had the lowest bid and was awarded the contract, but the in-state contractor filed for a writ of mandamus to compel the city to grant it the contract instead based on the preference it claimed under Ariz. Code Ann. &sect; 56-107 (1939). The writ was granted and the city appealed, arguing that &sect; 56-107 was unconstitutional in light of Ariz. Code Ann. &sect; 10-610 (1939). The court upheld as constitutional certain criteria listed in &sect; 10-610 in view of the principle that the right to contract was a qualified right where the public interest was involved and could be restricted if there was a reasonable basis for the restriction. The court held that the state, in contracting for the expenditure of tax money, had a reasonable basis for granting a five percent preference to contractors who, through the payment of taxes for two years, had made a contribution to the funds from which they were to reap a benefit. The court upheld the grant of the writ of mandamus, finding the in-state contractor to be the lowest responsible bidder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession and control of marijuana in violation of the Arizona Uniform Narcotics Act of 1935 (Act), Ariz. Code Ann. &sect; 68-801 et seq. (1939). On appeal, defendant alleged that the title of the Act was insufficient to inform defendant as to whether it embraced the imposition of penalties for its violation. Defendant claimed that the title was an unconstitutional violation of Ariz. Const. art. 4, part 2, &sect; 13. The court disagreed, holding that the general knowledge of the evils of narcotic drugs would have suggested to the ordinarily reasonable and prudent person that the legislation would be regulative and restrictive in character and would provide punishments for its violation. The court did hold that the prosecutor violated Ariz. Code Ann. &sect; 44-1004 (1939) by repeatedly attempting to elicit on cross-examination admissions from defendant indicating a former conviction. Because the prosecutor's misconduct deprived defendant of a fair trial, the court remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. Section 5 made it the duty of the board to formulate general policies affecting the public health. The formulation of policies was for the legislature and administrative rules had to be within the framework of policies that the legislature had sufficiently defined. Section 6 supra gave the board power to regulate sanitation and sanitary practices in the interests of public health and to protect and promote the public health and prevent disability and mortality. Such power was too broad and allowed the board to wander with no guide or criterion. The board could not have unrestrained power to regulate sanitation.

The statute subject to the proposed repeal had been initiated by petition and adopted by a majority of the votes cast thereon, but not by a majority vote of the qualified electors in the state. The court held that the legislature was not precluded from the proposed repeal by Ariz. Const. art. 4, pt. 1, &sect; 1(6), which provided that the veto power of the governor, or the power of the legislature, to repeal or amend did not extend to initiative or referendum measures approved by a majority vote of the qualified electors. The court held that the phrase &quot;a majority vote of the qualified electors&quot; was to be literally interpreted and did not mean a majority of the votes cast upon the particular measure. The court held that the reference of a measure by the legislature to the people was a part of the exercise of the legislative function and was not subject to injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought certification for review after moving in a trial court (Arizona) to quash an information charging violations of Ariz. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 66-156 and 66-157 (1939). He claimed that &sect;&sect; 66-156 and 66-157 were unconstitutional as violative of Ariz. Const. art. IV, pt. 2, &sect; 13; art. II, &sect; 10; and art. II, &sect; 15; and that the laws also represented an unwarranted, arbitrary, capricious, unlawful, and unconstitutional exercise of police powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who had been previously convicted of the offense of driving while intoxicated (DWI) sought quashor of a two-count information on the grounds that the statutes were unconstitutional and that the legislature exceeded its authority in the passage thereof. The court rejected all of the claims and held that the statutes were constitutional. After determining that there was no merit to defendant's claim, pursuant to Ariz. Const. art. IV, pt. 2, &sect; 13, that their subjects were not included in the title of the act of which they were a part, the court declared that the legislature had ample police power to pass legislation imposing penalties for DWI offenses. That power extended to public and private property and was not limited to public highways. Moreover, neither the inclusion therein of standards relating to alcohol content in a driver's blood nor the penalties imposed for violations thereof offended constitutional guarantees. Finally, the court ruled that it was proper for a trial court to consider whether a defendant had a prior DWI conviction in imposing sentence for a subsequent offense and to impose a more serious penalty in connection with a subsequent conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City of Phoenix challenged a judgment of the trial court (Arizona), which issued a judgment in an action filed by appellee, the Phoenix City Magistrate, declaring that an amendment to the Phoenix City Charter was unconstitutional and invalid in its entirety. The amendment provided the qualifications for the City Magistrate office, the manner of selection, appointment, and removal, and a definite term of office and minimum salary limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ariz. Const. art. VI, &sect; 11 provided that judges were ineligible for any office other than a judicial one during the term for which they were elected. Because the amendment attempted to use judges as a nominating board for candidates for the City Magistrate position, it clearly violated the Constitution. However, the City argued that the entire amendment should not have been invalidated because the remaining parts passed muster with the unconstitutional part stricken out. On appeal, the court disagreed. When the unconstitutional part of legislation was stricken out, that which remained had to be sustained if the remainder was complete in itself and was capable of being executed in accordance with the apparent legislative intent. In the case at bar, it was the clear intent of the amendment to require the City Magistrate appointee to be a licensed and practicing attorney. That requirement was inextricably bound up in the invalid method of providing for selection; without reference to the invalid provision, there was no guide as to what qualifications the officer had to possess. Thus, the remaining parts could not stand alone and, as such, the entire amendment was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employer was in default to the Commission for contributions. He delivered a promissory note and a realty mortgage to the assignor, which was recorded 16 days before the Commission recorded its lien. The assignor had no actual knowledge, or notice from any source whatsoever, of a lien of any kind. The court said a mortgagee had been protected by being able to depend upon the public records as to priority of liens and mortgages. If such protection was taken away, which was the effect of the lien authorized by the Act, then such result was unreasonable and destructive of inherent rights and the commercial life of the state would be impaired. Under the Act as written, the lien authorized might have had the effect of taking the property of a third person to pay the tax owed by an employer without a hearing or due process of law, and would offend, not only U.S. Const. amend.

The court first held that Ariz. Code Ann. art. 2, ch. 67 was not unconstitutional as an unlawful delegation of legislative power to the Arizona State Board of Examiners in the Basic Sciences. The Act did not delegate the responsibility of defining the basic sciences and delegated administrative, rather than legislative authority to the Board. The court also stated that the Act was not unconstitutional as violating the federal and State Due Process Clauses. Several provisions insured that due process was guaranteed to persons covered under the Act. The court further held that the Act did not violate Ariz. Const. art. 4, pt. 2, &sect; 19(13). The Act was not special legislation, but general, in that it embraced the whose State and operated upon all persons therein who practiced the medical arts.

From the owners' appeal, the court reversed and remanded.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured by a gas explosion. A workman's claim for compensation was filed and the Commission found that the employee suffered an injury by an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment. The employee returned the compensation check he received and executed an election of remedies to proceed under Ariz. Code Ann. &sect; 56-949 (1939) against a third party. The court found that the legislature intended to treat compensation and accident benefits as two separate and distinct entities, and that all injured employees should receive accident benefits, including those who elected to pursue a third party. The court ruled that in order for the employee's application for an accident benefits award to have been a binding election, he must have had knowledge of his alternative remedy to pursue the third party. The court determined that the Commission did not base its award on whether the employee had the requisite knowledge, but rather, that his application precluded him from pursuing his remedy against a third party. Setting aside the award, the court held that the Commission's decision was not justified by the state workmen's compensation act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff barber appealed from an order of the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) dismissing his complaint, wherein he sought a declaratory judgment to adjudge that the price-fixing provisions of the Barber Act, Ariz. Code Ann. art. 1, ch. 67 (1939) (Act) were unconstitutional. The barber also asked for an injunction restraining the enforcement of price-fixing provisions by defendant State Board of Barber Examiners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The barber's shop was near the Mexican border and haircuts were available there cheaper than the price set by the Board, thus depriving him of business. The barber contended that the fixing of minimum prices for barbering services had no reasonable or substantial relation to the public health, safety, or the general welfare, and hence, the Act that provided for price-fixing violated Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 4 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court said the police power was not unrestrained. The Board failed to indicate, or to establish any logical relationship whatsoever, the basis for its assumption that the Act was not arbitrary and wholly unwarranted; nor did it point out any possible facts which, if assumed to be true, would place them within the purview of the operation of the rule; nor was the court able to discover any from the reported cases or otherwise conceive of any. The court held that the Act was therefore unconstitutional and void as a violation of Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the cause remanded, with directions that the order of dismissal was to be vacated and the motion to dismiss overruled, and further proceedings were not to be in conflict with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Post Auditor of the State of Arizona brought an original proceeding against respondent State Auditor of the State of Arizona to compel her to issue to him a warrant in payment of his salary as post auditor. The state auditor contended that the act creating the post auditor position was unconstitutional as violating the separation of powers doctrine and that the failure of the legislature to confirm his appointment created a vacancy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">H.B. 74, ch. 28 created the office of post auditor. The act provided that the post auditor would be appointed by the president of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives with the advice and consent of a majority of the senate and of the house of representatives. The act further provided that the first post auditor be appointed for a three-year period. The court found that there was no violation of the doctrine of separation of powers pursuant to Ariz. Const. art. 3 because, where the constitution provided that the duties of the state auditor were to be &quot;prescribed by law&quot;, there were no express restrictions imposed upon the legislature with respect to the powers and duties of the state auditor. The court held, therefore, that the legislature was acting within the scope of its legislative authority in providing for appointment of a post auditor. Finally, the court concluded that the failure of the legislature to confirm the appointment of the post auditor did not create a vacancy because, having been lawfully appointed, he continued in office until the end of his terms unless his appointment was affirmatively disapproved by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner physicians appealed from an order of the Superior Court of Mohave County (Arizona), which quashed its earlier writ of certiorari against respondent board of supervisors (the board), dissolved the stay that had been ordered at the time the writ was issued, and dismissed the petition. The physicians challenged a regulation that denied their county hospital privileges for failure to assist other physicians.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mohave County, Ariz., Regulation 111 required any doctor with privileges at the county hospital to assist other doctors upon request. The regulation did not provide for notice or hearing before revocation of staff privileges. The board revoked the privileges of the physicians without detailed reasons. On appeal, the court held that a petition for a writ of certiorari was a proper mechanism for a challenge to the jurisdiction of the board in its enforcement of a regulation that the physicians alleged to be so unreasonable and so unjust as to be unconstitutional. The court found that while localities could regulate and control their hospitals and prescribe reasonable rules and regulations to be followed by doctors using the facilities, the board could not arbitrarily preclude a regularly licensed physician from the right to practice in a county hospital, so long as such physician stayed within the law. The court held that the regulation invaded the personal liberty and contractual rights of both the patient and the physician and that enforcement of the rule would enslave a physician. The court also held that the lack of notice and a hearing offended due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the employee argued that the Act was unconstitutional and void because the it was not initiated, submitted, or referred to a vote of the people or enacted in conformity with Ariz. Const. art. 4, pt. 1, &sect; 1. However, the court held that once a law was passed and duly promulgated, it was conclusively presumed to have been regularly enacted and was invulnerable to attack upon the ground of a defective title appearing on the ballot. The employee further argued that the Act was unconstitutional because it unlawfully delegated legislative power to the board of trustees and the actuary, where the Act allowed them to fashion tabular standards as they deemed fit. However, the court held that the Act did not unlawfully delegate legislative power but merely authorized the board of trustees, with the aid of their actuary, to find the necessary actuarial facts and prescribe the executive details for carrying out the legislation. Therefore, the court held that the Act was constitutional as applied to state employees, but determined that the employee could not challenge the constitutionality of the Act as applied to municipalities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The telephone company appealed the commission's denial of its application for a rate increase. The trial court set aside the commission's orders and granted the telephone company's motion for temporary relief by allowing it to charge certain increased rates. The trial court found that the commission's order was unlawful and remanded the case to the commission for a determination of a fair rate of return to be allowed and for the fixing of just and reasonable rates. Pending the final determination, the trial court allowed the continuation of the temporary rates subject to the telephone company posting a bond to secure a refund of the temporary rates if found to be in excess of the rates finally established by the commission. The commission appealed, contending that the trial court had no inherent power to provide relief pending the correction of the unlawful commission orders. The court held that, although the trial court could not make utility rates, it could, in the exercise of its jurisdiction, attach to the judgment enjoining the confiscatory rates a condition that the telephone company could not collect rates in excess of a stated amount to avoid confiscation.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the tax under the Act was not a true sales tax but a tax upon the privilege of engaging in business within the state. The court held that the two percent tax imposed upon the taxpayer by Ariz. Code Ann. &sect; 73-1303(d)(1) constituted a part of the taxpayer's gross proceeds of sales or gross income from business. The tax pursuant to &sect; 73-1303(d)(1) was part of the selling price which formed the base upon which the amount of the tax was levied. Contrary to the taxpayer's argument, &sect; 73-1331(c) did not show the legislative intent was not to include the tax as part of the gross income because it would have been stated in clear and unmistakable language.

He was sentenced to not less than 20 nor more than 25 years on each count, the sentences to run concurrently. On appeal, the court affirmed because (1) there was no legal basis for defendant to file his &quot;plea in bar&quot; and later a &quot;plea to the merits and in bar&quot; because he was limited to a motion to quash; (2) the only ground specified in the motion to quash was not one of the grounds enumerated under Ariz. Code Ann. &sect; 44-1005, and, thus, could not legally form the basis for such a motion; (3) the motion to quash not having been timely made was waived; (4) the crime of robbery was sustained by the evidence even though actual ownership of the property was in one other than the complainant because one who had the right of possession as against the thief was, so far as the latter was concerned, the owner; and (5) Ariz. Code Ann. &sect; 43-3203 was not unconstitutional because the parole board never had the power to grant a parole to a prisoner until his minimum sentence had been served, and, thus, any power that the board previously had was not affected by &sect; 43-3203.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ariz. Code Ann. &sect; 16-2007 directed county supervisors to estimate the expenses of volunteer fire departments, to levy taxes, and to distribute funds for fire equipment and maintenance. When the supervisors failed to do so, the volunteer fire department sought a writ of mandamus to compel the payment. The trial court granted the writ, and the court affirmed its judgment. The court rejected the supervisors' contention that the word &quot;may&quot; in &sect; 16-2007 was permissive or that it gave them discretion to decide not to make the award. The statute's purpose was to provide fire protection for certain communities outside the protection of a municipal fire department, and those privileges and immunities were provided at public expense. The legislature did not intent to vest discretion in the supervisors because there were no standards in the statute by which their discretion could have been measured. A delegation of absolute and arbitrary power was unconstitutional. Because the statute lacked any standards, limitations, or policies to guide the supervisors, it was apparent that the legislature did not give them the claimed discretion and they were required to make the payment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Hospital District Act (Act) created a mechanism for the creation of hospital districts. Among other provisions, the Act outlined the requirements to be met before an individual was able to vote in the district. The Act stated that any resident real property owner in the district was able to vote in an election. The taxpayers filed its declaratory judgment action, arguing that the Act violated the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution because the Act was ambiguous and indefinite as to who qualified as a voter and that the Act violated Ariz. Const. art. 7, &sect;&sect; 2, 13 because the Act was in conflict with the definition of qualified voters therein. The trial court dismissed the action. On appeal, the court affirmed the order of the trial court. The Act did not violate the equal protection clause because the definition of voter in the Act was clear and unambiguous. Further, Ariz. Const. art. 7, &sect;&sect; 2, 13 were self-executing constitutional provisions. Therefore, any statutes relating to their subject matter only needed to be in harmony with them.

The order had the effect of requiring the employer to insure said employees. The employer instituted a class action on behalf of himself and others similarly situated. The trial court entered an adverse judgment and the employer appealed claiming multiple assignments of error. On review, the court rejected the employer's argument that the trial court erred when it refused to render judgment under the Declaratory Judgment Act. The court reasoned that the Act established a procedure of its own and that the procedure furnished a remedy which was substantial, complete, and exclusive in compensation cases. However, the court did reverse the trial court's finding that employer was responsible to insure certain categories of employees. The court reasoned that the employees were independent contractors and not subject to the provisions of the Act. Finally, the court remanded the case to determine whether a category of photographers were independent contractors or not.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners petitioned the Board of Supervisors to organize an irrigation water district. The petition was examined and found by the Board to conform to Ariz. Code Ann. &sect; 75-500 et seq. (1939). A bond was fixed and was provided by the owners. A hearing was set to afford the owners within the proposed district an opportunity to appear and object to the organization. The Board heard the objections and refused to organize the district. The owners then filed the action for writ of mandamus compelling the Board to proceed under statute to organize the district. The trial court dismissed the application and quashed the alternative writ previously issued and rendered a judgment for the Board. The board contended that the statute gave it broad discretionary power to refuse to organize. On appeal, the court held that the statute authorizing the Board to hear objections to proposals to create the district conferred discretionary power upon the Board to refuse to organize even though all statutory procedural requirements for formation of the district had been met. Further, the Board did not abuse its discretion in refusing to organize, as there was no present need for such district.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By direct information, plaintiff County Attorney for Maricopa County accused defendant corporation of unlawfully offering to sell horse meat for human consumption that was unlawfully labeled and sold under the name of hamburger, in violation of the provisions of Ariz. Code Ann. art. 13, ch. 50 (1939). The Superior Court for the County of Maricopa (Arizona) denied the corporation's motion to quash. The trial court certified the issue to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation questioned the constitutionality of Ariz. Code Ann. art. 13, ch. 50 (1939), entitled Horsemeat for Human Consumption, or the horse meat act. The corporation argued that the Fourteenth Amendment demanded that statutes passed under the police power have some natural and reasonable basis and relationship to the object to be accomplished. The court held that the State had the right to regulate the livestock industry, particularly that portion devoted to the slaughter and sale of animals for human consumption. Although the horsemeat act required horsemeat to be slaughtered in an establishment separate and apart from other livestock, the court held that this was not a denial of the Equal Protection Clause because the legislation sought to protect the public interest from fraud. By requiring horsemeat to be slaughtered in separate establishments, the legislature sought to make it more difficult for the unscrupulous to sell horsemeat products in place of other meat products, or the possibility of the occurrence of innocent mistakes by confusing horsemeat with other meats. The court held that prevention of fraud was a valid exercise of the State's police power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An order to show cause was directed against respondents in an action brought by the State Bar. Respondents filed motions to vacate, quash, and dismiss the order alleging that the title to the Arizona State Bar Act, Ariz. Code Ann. &sect; 32-301 et seq. (1939), was insufficient to meet the requirements of Ariz. Const. art. 4, &sect; 13, pt. 2, insofar as the provisions of the State Bar Act dealt with rules of professional conduct, disbarment and discipline, breach of rules, local administrative committees, and proceedings and procedure of disbarment. The court granted the motions to quash and dismiss the order. The court held that Ariz. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 32-329, 32-335, 32-337, 32-338, 32-339, and 32-340 (1939) were unconstitutional and void. The title under which the State Bar Act was enacted was too restricted to authorize the broad powers granted to the Arizona State Bar under the provisions of the act related to the discipline, suspension, and disbarment of attorneys. The matters were not germane or directly or indirectly related to the subject of the title and had no natural connection to it. No one reading the title could logically infer that the provisions would be incorporated in the act.</SPAN></P>

Judgment was rendered for defendants on the ground that the law was unconstitutional. The court reversed. The law was not unconstitutionally vague where only the county attorney, the party that instituted the action, was authorized to satisfy the judgment lien of record. The law, which required adult children of old-age recipients to refund assistance paid, established a reasonable classification under the Equal Protection Clause because the number of needy blind that received assistance hardly compared to the number that received old age assistance, and the obligation to pay for the maintenance of certain relatives did not in itself constitute double taxation. Because the statute did not include a &quot;son-in-law,&quot; only a judgment for a separate debt against the daughter could have been found. Such a judgment was not recoverable out of defendants' community property because public policy favored the maintenance of the community over the support of the aged.</SPAN></P>

The landowner brought an action for inverse eminent domain, Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 17, after waters came down the water district's artificially created diversion channel and flooded his land and damaged his crops.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that it was unnecessary for the landowner to comply with the statutes governing verified claims, which did not apply to eminent domain liability. The court found that the right of property in the individual and to damages for its taking existed long prior to the adoption of the state constitution, so it was not a liability created by statute to which the one-year statute of limitations applied. The court found that the water district's method by which it attempted to use and take the land must necessarily be by prescription, because it had neither purchased nor condemned it under eminent domain. The court concluded that no amount of delay short of the prescriptive period of 10 years would defeat the landowner's action for compensation. The court found that the fact that the landowner still had his property was no satisfaction for his damages, because a taking of any kind or an infringement on the use of his property that diminished its value in whole or in part was a compensable loss. The court concluded that the measure of damages was the depreciation in the market value of the whole tract and that damage to crops was to be taken into consideration.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the extradition warrant recited ample jurisdictional facts establishing that the inmate was a fugitive from justice and was prima facie evidence thereof. The court found that the evidence submitted to the trial court by the inmate was at best only contradictory of the substantial evidence presented by the State. The court held void that part of Ariz.

The Superintendent filed a motion for summary judgment, which was denied, and it appeared that respondent judge would proceed to try the case unless the court ordered otherwise by writ of prohibition. Respondents filed a motion to dismiss, which the court denied and made the alternative writ of prohibition peremptory. The driver was given the opportunity in Nebraska to be heard and to disprove the charge, and by pleading guilty he had to accept all of the burdens and disabilities that flowed from the Nebraska conviction. It was undoubtedly the intention of the legislature to keep those convicted of DUI off the Arizona highways, whether their offense was committed within or without Arizona.</SPAN></P>

A temporary restraining order was issued to prevent defendants from taking bets. The attorney general and several others went to serve the order.

The police seized several items that bookies commonly used in running their operations. Defendants unsuccessfully filed motions to suppress. Defendants were convicted. Motions for a new trial and arrest of judgment were denied. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the information that charged that defendant took money on a race that was to be run was not insufficient. It did not matter whether the race was actually conducted. The prohibition in Ariz. Code Ann. &sect; 73-1607a (Cum. Supp. 1939) of &quot;placing or making a bet or wager&quot; also necessarily encompassed the receiving of the bet. By receiving the bet, the bookie was also betting that the person making the bet would lose.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The California Supreme Court accepted original jurisdiction and issued, on request of petitioner, an alternative writ of mandamus commanding the Industrial Commission of Arizona (Commission), respondents, to issue an insurance policy to petitioner or to appear and show cause why it should not do so. The Commission contended that corporations in the motion picture industry, such as petitioner, had grossly evaded the law and had not complied with the incorporating statutes of the state to subject them to due process in the courts. The court quashed the alternative writ of mandamus and held that the Commission was justified in refusing to issue a policy of insurance pursuant to the facts submitted by the Commission. The court reasoned that the state legislature laid down flexible rules under which the Commission, in its management of the State Compensation Fund, could apply sound insurance principles to decide the rate of premium.</SPAN></P>

When the veteran learned of the sale, he tendered the taxes which were allegedly due, but the county refused to accept them. In the meantime, the property was sold to the purchasers. The veteran filed an action for clear title to the property. The purchasers filed a cross-claim for reimbursement of the purchase price. The trial court found in favor of the veteran and the purchasers. On the State and county officials appeal, the court reversed. Pursuant to Ariz. Code Ann. &sect; 73-303 (1939), anyone entitled to a veteran's exemption was required to make application for that exemption each year. The failure to make application was deemed a waiver, pursuant to Ariz. Code Ann. &sect; 73-304.

The court held that the exercise of the state's police power in adopting the presumptively constitutional amendment was not so unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious as to be unconstitutional. The labor organizations failed to meet their burden of showing that the amendment was irrational and did not contribute to the public health, safety, and welfare. Nor did the amendment impair the rights of free speech and assembly because it protected the rights of workers to choose whether or not to become union members. Also, the amendment did not retrospectively alter existing contracts. In addition to the foregoing, the judicial power was limited to an assessment of the amendment's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the taxpayers had a right to challenge the Act because they were financially affected by it, in that taxes were levied on their property to raise funds that they alleged would be spent illegally in paying the Federal Power Commission (FPC) to assist the commission in a rate survey to establish a rate base. The Act was held unconstitutional under Ariz. Const. arts. 3, 15; and U.S. Const. amend. X because while it was not illegal for the commission, as a state agency, to use the FPC's services on a rate survey, the commission had been created under Ariz.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county brought an eminent domain action against defendant landowner pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-1116 for road construction. Following a bench trial, the court awarded defendant $ 27,890 for the parcel condemned, plus taxable costs. Plaintiff then moved, pursuant to Ariz. R. Civ. P. 68, for sanctions because the award was more favorable to it than its pretrial offer. The trial court denied plaintiff's motion. On appeal, plaintiff contended that the trial court erred when it found that Ariz. R. Civ. P. 68 did not apply to eminent domain proceedings. The court found a direct conflict between the rule and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-1128, which gave the court discretion to apportion costs. Since mandatory cost allocation in eminent domain proceedings implicated a substantive constitutional right, the trial court did not err in finding Ariz. R. Civ. P. 68 did not apply to eminent domain proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order denying plaintiff's request for sanctions affirmed because the trial court did not err in refusing to apply the mandatory cost allocation rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Minor fired four shots into the air in a residential neighborhood. The juvenile court adjudicated him delinquent under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3111, minor in possession of a firearm, and disorderly conduct. Under &sect; 13-3111(H), application was limited to counties with populations of more than 500,000 persons. Minor argued that this limitation violated Ariz. Const. art. IV, pt. 2, &sect; 19. The court held that: (1) there was a legitimate legislative purpose: regulating a minor's possession and use of firearms; (2) rather than encompassing all members of the relevant class, it applied to juveniles in the two most populated counties only; (3) the class created was insufficiently elastic: it was only theoretical, not probable that counties' populations would shift enough for others to enter or exit the class; and therefore, (4) &sect; 13-3111 was unconstitutional.

Defendants argued that the statute was a special or local law in violation of the Arizona Constitution, and that it violated the equal protection clauses of the Arizona and United States constitutions. The court held that the law was not a special law that violated the Arizona Constitution because it rationally furthered a legitimate governmental purpose (to prevent cruelty to animals and injury to others), applied to all persons in Arizona, and benefited no static class of individuals. Thus, the court also held that the statute did not violate the equal protection clauses of either the Arizona or United States Constitutions because it was rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose, and the drafters and voters could have concluded that the statute would achieve that purpose.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff argued the statute did not apply for the following reasons: plaintiff was not a recreational user at the time of her accident; festival was a civic event that did not qualify as a &quot;recreational use&quot;; and the &quot;fee paid&quot; exception to immunity applied because defendant received consideration for plaintiff to be on the premises to sell goods.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of child molestation contending that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4511, allowing the admission of a minor's prior recorded statement, was unconstitutional and also that the admission of the victim's statement to her stepmother as an excited utterance was error. The court reversed holding that Ariz. Rev. Code &sect; 13-451 was an unconstitutional exercise of legislative power because it expanded on, conflicted with, and engulfed the court's rules. Neither was the statement admissible under Ariz. R. Evid. 803(24)'s catchall exception to the hearsay rule because it was not more probative than the victim's in-court testimony, both being similar. Such bolstering was impermissible. The admission was prejudicial error when the jury's verdict may have been affected. The victim's statement to her stepmother, however, was properly admitted as an excited utterance because the statement was made while the victim was still under the stress of the incident.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner objected and filed a special action challenging the constitutionality of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-235, which allowed the juvenile court to enter the orders. The appellate court vacated the juvenile court's orders directing and controlling the conduct of petitioner, because the juvenile court did not secure jurisdiction over petitioner and the statute was applied in a manner that violated petitioner's rights to notice, to remain silent, and to counsel. The appellate court further held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-235(B)(2) was unconstitutional, because it was too vague to be enforceable.

Defendant argued that several of its publication's qualities - newsprint, classified ads, movie listings, and a calendar of local events - were typical newspaper features. However, on appeal, the court applied dictionary definitions and concluded that defendant's publication was not a newspaper because it did not contain several key factors of a newspaper, such as news and editorials. The tax court's grant of summary judgment for plaintiff was affirmed because a publication that resembles only the advertising section of a newspaper is not itself a newspaper.</SPAN></P>

IV and XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee's automobile was stopped by police because it had a cracked windshield. As a result of evidence seized during the stop, appellee was indicted on felony charges. Appellee's motion to suppress the evidence was granted on the basis that the automobile stop and subsequent search were in violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV and XIV. The charges against appellee were dismissed. The appellate court ruled that the traffic stop to investigate possible vehicle equipment violation was constitutional, and that the decision to stop appellee's automobile was reasonable because the police had probable cause to believe that a traffic violation occurred. Further, the court held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-957.01(A) required a vehicle to have an adequate windshield, and that whether the windshield on an automobile was adequate was first investigated by a police officer and next determined by a fact finder if the officer issued a traffic citation for an alleged violation. The court reversed the trial court's judgment, concluding that the officer was not required to determine the adequacy of the windshield before he stopped appellee's automobile to investigate the obviously cracked windshield.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment granting appellee's motion to suppress and dismissing charges against appellee was reversed where the decision to stop an automobile was reasonable; the police had probable cause to believe that a traffic violation occurred, it was undisputed that appellee's windshield was cracked, and the officer thus had a legitimate reason to stop appellee's vehicle to investigate the adequacy of his windshield.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners challenged the Industrial Commission of Arizona's (ICA) commutation of respondent employees workers' compensation award to a lump sum without first obtaining their consent, allegedly required by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1067(B).The court held that the ICA was not required to obtain a private, uninsured employer's consent before commuting a workers' compensation award to a lump sum. These employers were not &quot;carriers&quot; by statutory definition. The court examined the large scheme of the Arizona workers' compensation statutes and found that the disparate treatment was justified because uninsured employers were not in compliance with the workers' compensation statutes and, thus, not entitled to their protections and benefits. Therefore, a rational basis for the disparate treatment existed, enabling the legislation to survive an equal protection challenge. The court dismissed petitioners' due process argument because petitioners received notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the lump-sum commutation, which their attorney waived.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the commutation of the workers' compensation award to a lump-sum payment.

Pursuant to Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile pled delinquent to criminal damage in exchange for a promise by the state to dismiss other charges for unlawful use of a vehicle and curfew violation. As part of the plea agreement, defendant's driving privileges were suspended pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-3320(A)(3). Defendant was placed on probation and required to perform community service. On appeal, defendant argued that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-3320(A)(3), which suspended the driving privileges of juveniles who had been convicted of criminal damage, violated the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court rejected defendant's argument and affirmed the trial court's decision. Arizona Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-3320(A)(3) did not violate either the equal protection clause or the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The statute was not arbitrary and was reasonably related to the legitimate state interest of deterring juveniles from committing crimes. The statute did not distinguish between juveniles based on age and imposed the same punishment on all juveniles who committed criminal damage. The statute was also subject to procedural safeguards.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees purchased tax liens on a lot which was in Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) receivership. The lot was sold by RTC to appellant. Under the Financial Institution Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act, 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1825, states and local government were prevented from imposing taxes on property held by the RTC as receiver, and no property of the RTC was subject to levy, attachment, garnishment, foreclosure, or sale without the consent of RTC, nor could any involuntary lien attach to the property of the RTC. Therefore, the tax lien on the lot in RTC receivership and, thus, the purchase of that lien by appellees was invalid. Appellant redeemed the taxes on a second lot, and attorney fees were granted to appellee in the full amount incurred in the purchase of tax liens on both lots. The appellate court found no reasonable basis for the awarding of fees incurred for the lot that was sold in error to appellee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee tortfeasor, a state employee, was sued by appellee victims for sexual harassment and misconduct in the form of offensive remarks, quid pro quo sexual demands, and rape. Appellees, victims and tortfeasor, sought and received a declaratory judgment mandating that appellant state indemnify the tortfeasor because of actions taken while acting within the scope of his authorization. Appellant state argued that the record did not support a grant of summary judgment or a declaratory decision that appellee tortfeasor acted within the scope of his employment or authorization. The court agreed, noting that the inference should have been made by a trier of fact, not on a summary motion. The court therefore reversed the granting of appellees' declaratory judgment on that issue. However, the court held that it was not violative of public policy to provide a fund of insurance to compensate people injured by government agents while acting in their governmental capacities. The court additionally found that a trier of fact should have decided whether the felony exclusion law was applicable to the case. The court therefore reversed and remanded on the indemnity issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The awarding of a declaratory judgment to appellees, victims and tortfeasor, was reversed because the court held that the issue of whether indemnity was mandated was better left to a jury and should not have been decided on a summary motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the administrative law judge's finding that petitioner's disability payments were suspended pursuant to Ariz.

The court held that no substantive due process rights were violated because even though workers' compensation payments were considered property, they were statutory rights and not fundamental or substantive rights. The court held that the disparate treatment of prisoners and non-prisoners was founded on real differences rationally related to the purposes of workers' compensation and was therefore proper. The court noted that injured workers were compensated for their lost earning capacity, but an incarcerated person was removed from the labor market, and his payments would resume once when he returned. The court noted petitioner was given notice and opportunity to be heard before his suspension of payments occurred, and it dismissed petitioner's remaining contentions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant minor child was injured when he went sledding on appellee city's property. Appellants, mother and guardian ad litem, sued appellee cite, alleging it was negligent in that it did not make safe the areas in which children sledded and did not attempt to prevent sledding. Appellants also alleged that the attractive nuisance doctrine applied. Appellee's motion for summary judgment was granted after appellee argued the Recreational Use Statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 33-1551, gave appellee immunity and that the attractive nuisance doctrine did not apply. On appeal, the court held that appellee did not engage in any conduct rising to the level of gross negligence and that the Recreational Use Statute applied. The court noted that appellee attempted to discourage sledding on its property but that the signs kept being torn down and used for sleds. The court also noted that appellee did not make the sledding area an artificial condition by removing shrubs and bushes. The court found that appellant minor child was supervised by his stepmother, and thus the attractive nuisance doctrine did not apply. Therefore, summary judgment in favor of appellee city was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The award of summary judgment to appellee city was affirmed because there was no evidence to support a finding that it was grossly negligent in allowing people to sled on its property.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant telephone company sought review of an order of the Maricopa County Superior Court (Arizona), which denied its motion for partial summary judgment and granted appellee agency's cross-motion for summary judgment in a suit challenging appellee's rules to allow companies to compete with appellant for customers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee agency promulgated rules allowing companies to compete with appellant telephone company. Appellant filed suit asserting breach of contract and asserting the rules were invalid. Appellant sought review of the order denying its motion but granting appellee's motion for summary judgment. The court held appellant's claims were ripe; appellant did not have to exhaust administrative avenues before pursuing its breach of contract action and properly exhausted such remedies in its challenge to the rules. The court found appellant did not have a breach of contract claim because no contract was created by the state constitution or statutes. Certain rules were properly promulgated because they were related to appellee's plenary power and did not have to be reviewed by the attorney general under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41-1044. The rules relating to the issuance of competitive licenses required such review as they were not related to ratemaking and not within appellee's plenary power. The court affirmed the dismissal of the breach of contract claim and agreed certain rules did not require attorney general review, but it reversed as to the remainder of the rules which required review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order denying appellant telephone company's motion for summary judgment and granting appellee agency's motion was affirmed in part because appellant failed to establish contract existed and, thus, failed to state a claim for breach of contract; order was reversed in part because certain of the challenged rules were not related to ratemaking, were not within appellee's plenary power, and were, thus, invalid until reviewed by the attorney general.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners, persons against whom sexually violent person petitions were filed, brought a special action petition challenging the constitutionality of the Act. The court ruled that the Act was civil in nature because it focused on treatment for sexually violent persons and protection of the public. Further, the court held that the Act did not violate constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto laws and double jeopardy because it was civil, not penal. Also, the court found that the Act rationally advanced legitimate governmental goals, namely, protecting citizens from individuals who were judicially determined to be dangerous and treating sexually violent persons. The court denied the special petition, concluding that reasonable classification did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

P. 16.2(b), by proving that police seized the evidence against defendant during a warrantless search, the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) struck defendant's motion to suppress with leave to refile.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the prosecution filed an information charging various drug offenses, defendant moved to suppress evidence seized as the result of an allegedly illegal search. Defendant showed the uncontested fact that police conducted a warrantless search to seize the evidence. The trial court denied defendant's motion, concluding that defendant did not carry the burden of going forward under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 16.2(b). Defendant sought review by filing a special action. Finding that defendant lacked an adequate remedy by appeal, the court asserted special action jurisdiction to review the trial court's denial of the motion to suppress the fruits of an allegedly illegal search. Under Rule 16.2(b), the court held that defendant satisfied the initial burden of going forward by proving the lack of a warrant. Because the challenged evidence was obtained without a warrant, the prosecution had to carry the entire evidentiary burden pursuant to the &quot;warrant/no warrant&quot; dichotomy recognized by federal and a majority of state courts. Therefore, the court vacated and remanded the trial court's order that granted the prosecution's motion to strike defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant dentist sought review of an order from the Superior Court in Maricopa (Arizona), which affirmed appellee agency's censure of appellant after an investigative interview.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee agency conducted an investigative interview of appellant dentist and censured him after finding he engaged in unprofessional conduct with respect to fitting a patient with dentures. The finding of misconduct and the censure were affirmed on appeal, and appellant sought further review. The court held the investigative interview did not violate appellant's procedural due process rights. Appellant was afforded the opportunity to be heard, had sufficient notice of the charges and evidence against him, presented a defense, testified, and was represented by counsel. The court found that although notice of the investigative interview was insufficient because it did not apprise appellant of his right to a formal hearing, the deficiency was harmless because appellant and his counsel were aware of such right. Substantial evidence supported appellee's decision and its sanction was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-1263.02, allowing appellee to impose sanctions after a hearing, was constitutional because the hearing qualified as a due process hearing. The court, thus, upheld the order affirming appellee's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Juvenile pleaded delinquent to criminal trespass and stipulated to a restitution amount. After appellant mother was informed that she could be held responsible for the restitution, a restitution hearing was requested. At the hearing, the court held that, based on Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-341(H), appellant was bound by juvenile's stipulation. On appeal, appellee state argued that appellant lacked standing to appeal because appellant was not a party to the delinquency proceeding. The appellate court held that failing to appoint counsel for appellant during the delinquency proceeding was not erroneous because appellant did not have a right to counsel under Ariz. R. P. Juv. Ct. 6, and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-225. Furthermore, appellant had no due process right to counsel during the delinquency proceeding. In addition, the appellate court held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-341(H) was constitutional because it consistent with established public policy that parents were financially responsible for their children's actions. However, the appellate court remanded the case, holding that appellant was denied due process to a meaningful hearing before the Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-341(H) restitution order.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted judgment for defendant on its immunity defense and dismissed plaintiff's claims.

The court found that the anti-abrogation clause, Ariz. Const. art. 18, &sect; 6, could be circumscribed by a legislative statute that denied or limited damages for a certain violation and that the state had a compelling reason to grant immunity to medical peer reviewers in &sect; 36-445.02(B) as such reviews furthered a legitimate state interest in improving hospital care and preventing deaths.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant-appellant school district challenged a trial court decision reinstating plaintiff -appellee teacher, who was terminated by defendant-appellant's board after being placed on administrative leave with pay after allegations that he had behaved inappropriately toward some female students. The court applied the standard that a party asserting bias had the burden of rebutting the presumption of fairness and establishing a disqualifying interest, and found that plaintiff-appellee had not met his burden of proving either personal bias or institutional bias by board members. The court also held that the record lacked evidence to rebut the presumption that the board was fair and impartial. The court also found that plaintiff-appellee's pre-termination suspension was constitutionally permissible since it was with pay, and that some procedural irregularities did not prejudice plaintiff-appellee.

On appeal, the court determined that partial summary judgment in favor of appellee was proper on the vacant lot ordinance issue, and that the city's cause of action was not a vested right. The court also held that the court did not abuse its discretion in ordering appellee to remove only the second billboard face. The court, however, could not uphold the trial court's judgment that the city should have been estopped from asserting that the permits for three of the billboards were issued in violation of zoning regulations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court found that the vote by appellant city council officials to approve a rezoning request by appellee developer, rather than the adoption of the rezoning ordinance, was the referable legislative act. Therefore, the lower court held that the referendum petition filed by appellant citizens' group was untimely because it was filed more than 30 days after the minutes recording the vote were approved. The court affirmed because the lower court had properly applied the bright line rule, and, in cases challenging compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements, strict compliance was required. Attaching the approved minutes to the referendum petitions was sufficient without the attachment of appellee's stipulations of development conditions because to require otherwise would improperly amplify the scope of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-121(E). The court rejected appellants' waiver and laches argument although suit had been filed more than a year after verification of the petition signatures. The complaint had been filed well before the scheduled election and appellant citizen's group had ample time to mount a defense and present their case.</SPAN></P>

On review, appellant, the children's father, challenged the constitutionality of the grandparent visitation statute. He also argued that the amount of visitation awarded was excessive. The trial court granted appellees visitation with their granddaughters for four to eight hours twice a month, two days during Christmas break, and a three-day weekend during the summer. On appeal, the court noted that although a parent's right to custody and control was constitutionally protected, it was not beyond regulation. Under their constitutional powers, states may regulate the well-being of children. The court found that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-409 was rationally related to furthering the state's legitimate interest in enabling children to become responsible adults by fostering relationships between grandchildren and their grandparents. The court also found that the visitation awarded was reasonable and did not constitute an abuse of discretion. The children had spent extended periods of their young lives living in the grandparents' home.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that it must construe provisions together, in the context of the overall statutory scheme, and aim to achieve consistency among them.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county appealed from summary judgment for plaintiffs, which challenged defendant's right to tax plaintiffs' interests in an airport as real property and to assess ad valorem property taxes against those interests after the repeal of Arizona's possessory interest taxing scheme. The trial court found that plaintiffs' airport improvements interests were no longer subject to ad valorem property taxes because the repeal removed the required statutory mechanism for taxing possessory interests and showed the legislature's intent that such interests not be taxed. On review the appellate court noted that the best indicator of the drafters' intent was a provision's language. The judgment was affirmed on appeal because a legislative decision not to provide for ad valorem taxation of possessory interests did not &quot;exempt&quot; them from taxation. Possessory interests were a discrete category of property. The legislative decision did not &quot;exempt&quot; them. It omitted them from the state's exercise of its power to tax by dint of sovereign political discretion. Nothing in the ad valorem property taxation scheme suggested a legislative intent that possessory interests be taxed.</SPAN></P>

After receiving all briefing, the court reviews the entire record for reversible error. If any arguable issue presents itself, the court directs appointed counsel to brief the issue. Only after the court has ascertained that counsel has conscientiously performed his or her duty to review the record, and has itself reviewed the record for reversible error and found none, will the court allow counsel to withdraw.

Appellant sought review, and the court reversed the judgment. In order to render appellant's initiative procedure as nearly as practicable the same as those in Ariz. Rev.

Here, the initiative petition was issued on May 14, and the next ensuing election was the town general election on May 19.

The trial court refused to give an instruction on endangerment, under Ariz. Rev. Stat.

The court affirmed the conviction because there was no error in the trial court's refusal to instruct the jury on endangerment. The court found that endangerment by its nature was not always a lesser-included offense of drive-by shooting and that it was proper to deny the instruction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, injured parties and their survivors, filed suit against defendants, police officers and the State of Arizona Department of Public Safety, Maricopa County, after a criminal was negligently released and committed crimes that caused plaintiffs' damages. Plaintiffs appealed from a judgment in favor of defendant state, and defendant state appealed from the denial of sanctions under Ariz. R. Civ. P. 68(b). The court affirmed the judgment, and held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-820.02, which granted qualified immunity to public employees acting in the scope of employment unless they were grossly negligent, did not violate Ariz. Const. art. 18, &sect; 6. Further, the court ruled that the immunity statute was necessary to avoid a severe hampering of police work, an important governmental function. The trial court did not err in instructing the jury on a gross negligence standard of care, or in refusing to give the &quot;acting in concert&quot; instruction. Finally, the trial court properly denied sanctions against plaintiffs, pursuant to Ariz. R. Civ. P. 68(d), because unapportioned joint offers of judgment were invalid for purposes of Rule 68 sanctions.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that no ex post facto violation occurred when defendant re-offended and his punishment was increased as a repeat felony juvenile offender.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoners fell from a scaffolding that appellee state's prison officials had directed them to climb as part of their work. Appellants filed suit against appellee, and a jury awarded them damages. Pursuant to Ariz. Rev.

On appeal, the court affirmed, rejecting appellants' arguments that &sect; 31-238 was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 31, and art. XVIII, &sect; 6. The court held that the statute bore a rational relationship to the legitimate state interest of reducing the state's costs of incarceration and thereby reinforcing inmates' social accountability and fiscal responsibility for their crimes, such that it survived appellant's equal protection challenge. The court further held that the anti-abrogation clauses of the state constitution were not violated; because appellants were permitted to recover a portion of their judgment and their right of redress was not abolished, the statute did not grant de facto immunity to appellee.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-221.01(A) (1997) and its applicability to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers filed a lawsuit against defendants, county and state department of revenue, that claimed the reassessment allowed under Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42-221.01(A) for property with new construction violated equal protection and the uniformity clause of Ariz. Const. art. 9, &sect; 2(1). On appeal from the award of summary judgment to defendants, plaintiffs claimed that the trial court erred in failing to postpone its ruling on defendants' motion and in denying plaintiffs' constitutional claims. In affirming the judgment, the court found that because plaintiffs' request for a continuance failed to comply with Ariz. R. Civ. P. 56(f), the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing a continuance. The court found that the reassessment allowed under &sect; 42-221.01(A) for property that had construction improvements was based on the state's legitimate interest in taxing newly constructed property as soon as possible. Though it did not encompass properties with increased value due to rezoning and market factors, the court found no equal protection or uniformity clause violation because the latter were nonstructural changes which only minimally effected a property's value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment granted to defendants, county and state department of revenue, because the assessment statute challenged by plaintiff taxpayers permitted defendants to reassess plaintiffs' real property up to September 30th of the tax year if new construction was added to it. The classifications established by the statute did not violate either the equal protection or uniformity clauses of the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant guardian's daughter was severely injured in an automobile accident where the car rolled over. Appellant brought an action against appellee manufacturer alleging a negligent design and strict liability. Appellant did not name the driver of the vehicle in the action, because as her daughter's employer, he was statutorily immune from liability under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-906(A). Appellee manufacturer did name the employer as a nonparty at fault pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-2506(B) and Ariz. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(5). The jury returned a verdict for appellant but assigned only eight percent of the fault to appellee. On review, the court affirmed. The court found that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-2506 was a permissible legislative regulation which, although sometimes reducing as a practical matter the damages which the plaintiff received, did not violate Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 31. The court found that the statutory allocation of fault system did not necessarily favor plaintiffs or defendants, but rather permitted the trier of fact to evaluate all of the evidence, including facts bearing on causation, and to allocate fault based on the jurors' collective concept of what was fair.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment because the Arizona constitution was not a guarantee of a particular amount of recovery, and it permitted regulations effectively reducing a plaintiff's recovery. The Arizona statutory allocation of fault system constitutionally permitted jurors to evaluate all the evidence, including facts bearing on causation, and allocate fault based on the jurors' collective concept of what was fair.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A physician, the real party in interest, filed breach of contract and wrongful interference with prospective contractual relations claims against petitioner hospital based on his suspension from the emergency room call list. Respondent trial court denied petitioner's motion for summary judgment, in which it argued that it had immunity under Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 36-445.02 because it was conducting peer review. Petitioner filed a request for special action. The court granted relief in part. The court held that petitioner's by-laws were a contract, and that it breached that contract by suspending the real party in interest without a hearing. However, the breach of contract claim was barred by &sect; 36-445.02, which allows only injunctive relief on issues related to peer review. Further, the court held that the Anti-Abrogation Clause, Ariz. Const. art. 18, &sect; 6, applied only to tort actions, not to contract claims. The court ordered respondent to enter partial summary judgment for petitioner on the contract claim. The court denied relief on the wrongful interference claim, holding that the record as to that claim was insufficient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted in part petitioner hospital's request for special action, because respondent trial court erred in denying petitioner's motion for summary judgment on real party in interest physician's breach of contract claim, as petitioner was statutorily immune. The court denied relief as to real party in interest's wrongful interference claim, as the record was insufficient for the court to make a determination.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, arguing that the officer lacked authority to restrain defendant when she attempted to leave and that the officer used unreasonable force in the restraint. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction because the officer was acting in her official duties at the time of the assault and the officer used reasonable force in restraining defendant. The court held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-1204 encompassed all aspects of a peace officer's good faith performance of his or her job-related duties, even if the officer's actions were later found to be constitutionally unreasonable. Thus, even if the officer did not have reason to enter and remain in defendant's apartment and to detain defendant when she tried to leave, defendant could not prevail.

Defendants argued that the fraudulent scheme and artifice statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2310, was vague, overbroad, and internally inconsistent. They also argued the trial court's restitution calculation was fatally flawed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants engaged in a real estate scheme wherein they purchased property by offering a combination of cash and vacant land. The value of the vacant land was grossly misrepresented. One of the defendants would offer to buy the vacant land for a small down payment and a promissory note, which was without recourse to him. The houses thus purchased were quickly sold for cash at prices substantially lower than what defendants had &quot;paid&quot; for them. Defendants defaulted on the notes. The appellate court rejected defendants' argument that the statute under which they were convicted was vague and overbroad because it required the perpetrator to obtain benefit though scheme or artifice but provided that reliance on the part of the victim was not a necessary element of the offense. The court rejected defendants' argument that the statute was unenforceable because it imposed criminal liability for certain conduct even where no corresponding civil duty. The court rejected defendants' argument that the statute was internally inconsistent. The court ruled that the restitution award was flawed because it failed to account for certain offsetting factors, such as the value of the vacant land.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court found that there was no legislative intent, either express or implied, to prohibit all local firearms regulation, in light of the plain language of Ariz.

Stat. &sect; 13-3108(B), which evinced the legislature's intent to permit local ordinances relating to the transportation, possession, carrying, sale, and use of firearms. The court also held that Tucson, Ariz., City Code &sect; 21-3(5)(2) did not conflict with the provisions of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3108, which did not address the possession or carrying of firearms in city parks. Because the city's ban on firearms in its public parks was enacted for the promotion of public safety and for public welfare, which was a legitimate purpose, and was reasonably restricted to specific areas of the city, it was a reasonable limitation on the right to bear arms in defense of oneself as guaranteed by Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 26.

Defendant also contended that his convictions must be reversed because the trial court admitted autopsy photographs of the victim that unfairly prejudiced the jury. The court stated that &sect; 13-703(A) was not subject to analysis under the vagueness doctrine. The court determined that defendant had not proven that the absence of sentencing guidelines in &sect; 13-703(A) created a &quot;substantial disparate impact&quot; on his portion of the class. The court concluded that the life sentencing provisions of &sect; 13-703(A) were constitutional, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the autopsy photographs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Phoenix city council rezoned two golf courses, a corporation circulated a referendum petition and obtained enough signatures to have the rezoning decision referred to the voters. After the city of Phoenix set the date for a referendum election, a property owner filed a lawsuit to block the election. The property owner argued that the referendum petition was invalid because the corporation attached to it the rezoning ordinance when it should have attached the minutes of the meeting at which the council made the rezoning decision. The court reversed the lower court's injunction order and remanded the cause for dismissal of the property owner's complaint. The council's decision was a legislative act. Because the council adopted the rezoning ordinance before it approved the minutes of the meeting at which it made the rezoning decision, the corporation correctly decided to comply with Ariz. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured party appealed an order of the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which dismissed the injured party's complaint for damages against defendant Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District (SRP) based on the injured party's failure to file a notice of claim as required by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-821.01(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party filed a complaint against the SRP alleging injury by electric shock that occurred when he contacted a power line. The SRP filed a motion to dismiss based upon the injured party's failure to file a notice of claim as required by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-821.01(A), which required a party with a claim against a public entity to file a claim with the public entity within 180 days after the cause of action accrued, or the claim was barred. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss and entered judgment in the SRP's favor. On appeal, the injured party contended that the SRP was not a &quot;public entity&quot; under &sect; 12-821.01(A), and that the notice of claim statute denied him equal protection by unequally burdening his right to file a lawsuit against SRP. The court held that the notice of claim statute, as applied to SRP, did not violate equal protection because it did not deprive the injured party of a fundamental right. The Arizona Constitution defined the SRP as a political subdivision of the state, therefore, the injured party had no fundamental right to sue the SRP. The SRP was entitled to the same privileges and immunities as other governmental entities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment dismissing the injured party's complaint.</SPAN></P>

The state contended the money found inside the package was subject to forfeiture because it was used or intended to be used to facilitate the commission of various marijuana or narcotics-related offenses. Following a summary judgment that was granted in favor of the employee, the state appealed. The state contended that no meaningful interference occurred. The court reversed and remanded, holding that there was no constitutional violation. Further, the court held that the employee never possessed the package, sought to gain possession of it, or made any claim to its contents until four weeks after she had expressly denied any knowledge of the package. The court, therefore, concluded that the seizure was reasonable and that there was no unconstitutional interference with the employee's possessory interest in the property arising from the officers' actions. Additionally, the court found that the trial court erred in granting the summary judgment without an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

The trial court's judgment granting summary judgment to appellee healthcare facility was affirmed because a person who acted in good faith in accord with the terms of the Act was not subject to civil liability or criminal prosecution.

Further, the court held that there was no common law right of action to recover damages for more than negligent interference with a dead body in the organ donation context.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school applied for a charter, which the board denied on the basis of the director's bad credit rating. The trial court affirmed the board's decision, reasoning that, even though the law did not mandate the creditworthiness requirement, such a requirement was well within the board's discretion. The court reversed the decision of the trial court and remanded for the trial court to make complete findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court noted that Ariz. Rev. Stat.

The findings did not need to be detailed nor in any particular form, though the reviewing court had to be able to discern how the agency reached its conclusion. The court held that the requirement protected against careless or arbitrary action, facilitated judicial review, kept agencies within their jurisdiction, aided parties' preparation of cases for rehearing and judicial review, and prevented judicial usurpation of administrative action. The court also held that the school should be permitted to amend its application.</SPAN></P>

Previously a $ 20 million civil forfeiture judgment had been entered, but that amount was found to have constituted a second punishment in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state contended that forfeitures pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2314(D)(6)(a) (Supp. 1997) did not constitute fines for the purposes of the Eighth Amendment Excessive Fines Clause, and thus, sanctions imposed did not require review for excessiveness. Further, the state contended that assuming review for excessiveness was required the trial court erred in determining what amount would be excessive. The court concluded that the forfeiture was not intended to remedy an immediate danger but to punish persons who had engaged in criminal activity. The court held that because several factors pointed to a deterrent or retributive purpose, the forfeiture under the statute was subject to the limitations of the Excessive Fines Clause. The court affirmed the $ 50,000 award, holding that allowing a judgment against the individuals for the total amount of proceeds from the criminal activity, which the individuals participated in, was excessive. The court held that considering the number of people who participated in the illegal enterprise, and the individuals' roles in the enterprise, the award for the total amount of proceeds was not proportional to the individuals' culpability.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, appellant alleged that a prescreening of prospective jurors deprived him of his right to a fair cross-section of the community, that the exclusion of evidence that someone other himself was the killer denied him of his right under U.S. Const. amend. VI to put on a defense, that it was improper to admit evidence of the victim's telephone call identifying him, and that it was error to deny his request for a Willits instruction. The court affirmed, holding that appellant was not denied his Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial because there was no showing that the jury was biased. The court held that the preclusion of a third party defense which identified another person as the killer was not prejudicial because there was no evidence connecting anyone else to the shooting. The admission of the victim's call which identified appellant at her apartment was admissible as a present sense impression.

The trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment because the landowners had failed to present evidence that the city's apportionment of assessments was either fraudulent, arbitrary, or discriminatory. On appeal, the court affirmed the grant of summary judgment because the record provided ample support for the city council's determination that the improvements were of special benefit to property within the district and were not designed to serve the community at large.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant fired several gunshots from a car in which he was riding, wounding two rival gang members and killing a third. He was convicted of one count of murder, two counts of aggravated assault, and one count of drive-by shooting. The superior court enhanced the non-murder sentences by three years each pursuant to &sect; 13-604(T). The court held, inter alia, that 1) where a juror failed to show up for the second day of deliberations, the superior court did not err in substituting the alternate juror because this was permitted under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 18.5(h), 2) this did not violate the defendant's right to a fair and impartial jury because such action could be taken despite a defendant's objection under R. 18.5(h), 3) the superior court's instruction to the jury was adequate although it failed to instruct them to begin deliberations anew, 4) the enhancements under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-604(T) were improper because the prosecution failed to indicate that it intended to seek them before the jury was impaneled, and 5) this error did not require reversal of the convictions because the gang-related nature of the charges was apparent from the indictment and discovery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions and the natural life murder sentence, modified the remaining sentences to reduce them by three years each, and otherwise affirmed the sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After plaintiff driver and defendant driver were involved in an automobile accident, plaintiff filed a negligence action which was assigned to mandatory arbitration pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-133. The arbitrator defaulted defendant on liability as a discovery sanction for her repeated failure to appear for a deposition, and awarded plaintiff damages. The trial court dismissed defendant's appeal of the arbitration award on grounds that in violation of Unif. R. P. Arb. 7(a), defendant failed to participate in the arbitration and waived her right of appeal. The court agreed, ruling that the record supported the conclusion that defendant did not participate in the arbitration; her attorney could not fulfill her discovery obligations without her cooperation. But the court remanded for a reconsideration because the trial court erroneously based its judgment in part on defendant's failure to appear at the damages hearing as well. Plaintiff did not claim nor did the record indicate that defendant had relevant testimony to offer at the hearing or obstructed its conduct to any degree by failing to accompany her lawyer to the hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A statute provided that a court order dividing a marital estate rescinded any revocable disposition or appointment of property made by a divorced person to that person's former spouse. The Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) held that the statute deprived appellant wife of insurance proceeds upon the death of her former husband and awarded the insurance proceeds to the son. The wife and appellant insurance company sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the wife had standing to challenge the statute because it affected her expectancy interest in the insurance proceeds. In the dissolution decree, upon the agreement of the parties, the trial court awarded the insurance policy to the husband. The court held that the wife therefore lacked any reasonable basis for expecting that her beneficiary status would continue. Her interest in remaining the designated beneficiary was not unconstitutionally impaired by the revocation provision of the statute. The insurance company was obligated to pay the proceeds of the policy to the legal beneficiary. Any failure on its part to properly ascertain the identity of the beneficiary was not caused by the statute. The insurance company received &quot;written notice&quot; of the claimed revocation when it received a letter sent to it by the son's attorney. The insurance company was not prejudiced by receiving notice by first class mail at an office that was not its main office. Its actual notice of the divorce and revocation satisfied the substantive requirements of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the admission of the first test result in a criminal proceeding, standing alone, did not preclude an implied consent suspension. An officer requested that the licensee take the second test, but the licensee instead asked to speak to his attorney. When the officer asked for the attorney's name and address, the licensee unaccountably remained silent. The officer then reread the implied consent admonitions and the licensee declined to take the second test. The court declined to read the disjunctive phrasing in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-695(A)(3) as a limitation on a testing officer's authorization to administer the breath testing methods described therein, but found that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-691(A), (B) authorized more than one type of breath test. The court concluded that the officer had the authority to request that the licensee submit to the second breath test and that his refusal to perform the test justified an implied consent suspension. The court found that a reasonable person in the licensee's circumstances would have understood from the officer's warning that delay for any reason encompassed delay to await consultation with a lawyer.</SPAN></P>

The individual and his wife filed a personal injury action against the state and employee. The trial court dismissed the action pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-821 (1993). The individual and his wife sought review and asserted that the action was improperly dismissed because &sect; 12-821 violated the equal protection clauses of the U.S. Constitution and Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 13, and because Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-821 was part of a referendum that had been previously rejected by voters. The court held that the dismissal of the action was proper because the individual did not have a fundamental right to sue the state, &sect; 12-821 was rationally related to the purpose of enabling the state to respond to and resolve actions against it in a timely manner, and &sect; 12-821 was not the subject of the referendum that was rejected by the voters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) denied a motion to suppress the use of a portion of a blood sample taken by a hospital following the defendant's car accident, but prior to arrest or establishment of probable cause. The trial court denied relief in the defendant's complaint for special action. The defendant filed a petition for special action challenging the constitutionality of Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28-692(J) (1996).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was involved in an accident. Before any police arrived and before any allegation of probable cause, the hospital staff withdrew blood for medical purposes and at the same time took more blood than needed for medical purposes. They set the extra blood aside in case law enforcement requested it as a legal sample, which did later occur. The court held that the blood sample fell within the meaning of the language &quot;for any reason&quot; in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-692(J) (1996). It was taken for medical purposes. The hospital merely took enough blood so that it was not forced to either (1) inflict a second needle puncture in order to have enough blood for medical purposes after complying with a possible law enforcement request for a portion of it, or (2) face prosecution for refusing to comply. The hospital retained custody of the blood until the police requisitioned a portion of it. This indicated that all the blood was for medical purposes unless a portion of it was demanded for law-enforcement purposes. Only when the police requested and received the sample did it take on a legal purpose. Thus, at the time the sample was taken, its purpose was solely medical.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's denial of the defendant's motion to suppress the blood sample evidence, upheld the constitutionality of the statute as applied to the defendant, and denied relief.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the statements by the juvenile were assertions of his rights, not an attempt to start a fight. The court found that the juvenile did not want to be stopped by the officer and did not believe that the officer had a right to stop him. The court determined that the juvenile was charged with disorderly conduct simply because he asserted his constitutional rights in a loud and profane manner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3208(B) did not apply to a prostitute working alone, operating her business from her own apartment. Defendant claimed that terms in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3211(3) such as &quot;providing financial support,&quot; &quot;supervising activities or work schedules,&quot; and &quot;directing or furthering the aims of the enterprise&quot; indicated that the legislature intended the statute to apply only in those situations involving more than one prostitute. The appellate court found that the statute merely required that a person operate or maintain a house of prostitution; a finding that defendant performed every activity listed in the statute was not required. Defendant paid rent on the apartment, purchased advertising in certain publications, and scheduled her own appointments. Defendant therefore met the statutory definition of either operating or maintaining a house of prostitution. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3208(B) did not explicitly exclude prostitutes who operated and maintained their businesses from their own homes. The statute was not void for vagueness as it clearly proscribed defendant's conduct. The evidence of defendant's criminal conduct was overwhelming.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State moved to dismiss defendant's misdemeanor charge, and filed a felony DUI charge, which defendant moved to dismiss for prosecutorial vindictiveness. The State argued that the trial court erred in presuming vindictiveness, as no such presumption existed in the pretrial setting. The appellate court found in the record no additional facts to justify a presumption of vindictiveness. Defendant filed a routine motion to suppress statements and a demand for jury trial. It was unrealistic to presume that those assertions prompted retaliation by the State. Nothing the State did or did not do suggested a likelihood that it filed a felony charge in retaliation for defendant's routine assertion of procedural rights. The federal standard was now more tolerant of a prosecutor's pretrial decision to increase a charge than it was when an earlier case was decided.</SPAN></P>

Respondent failed to adopt an ordinance until eight years later when approval of a revised site plan was sought. Appellant landowners unsuccessfully protested the revision. Their request for a referendum serial number was also denied. The trial court dismissed their petition for special action and the court affirmed. It found that zoning was not effective until a formal ordinance was adopted and that respondent city could adopt the formal zoning ordinance at any time after the rezoning was approved. The court found that the trial court erred in determining that the adoption of the ordinance was not subject to the referendum power as the city clerk exceeded her authority in refusing to issue a serial number. It did not remand the matter, however, because the referendum process should have taken place after the initial rezoning approval and therefore the time for referendum had expired.

Defendant was sentenced to prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions stemmed from an incident in which defendant was riding with friends in a car and fired a gun at an occupied trailer home and an occupied house. Defendant was affiliated with a street gang. On appeal, defendant contended that Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 13-105(7)-(8) were unconstitutional because the definitions of &quot;criminal street gang member&quot; and &quot;criminal street gang&quot; were unconstitutionally vague. The supreme court held that defendant lacked standing to challenge the statute on the basis that it was unconstitutionally vague to others because he engaged in the proscribed conduct. The court also found that &sect;&sect; 13-105(7)-(8) did not have a real and substantial effect on the right of free speech and free assembly. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in refusing to give the jury a lesser-included offense instruction. The supreme court held that the crime of disorderly conduct was not a lesser-included offense of drive-by shooting. The court also held that the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on endangerment as a lesser-included offense because no rational jury could find the elements of endangerment but not drive-by shooting.</SPAN></P>

Real parties alleged that the injury was caused by petitioners' negligent design and construction of a building. The court granted special action review, but denied relief. The court agreed with another Arizona appellate panel that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-2602, which required a complaint against registered professionals or contractors to be supported with an expert's affidavit attesting to the validity of the claim, failed to survive strict scrutiny analysis. The right to recover damages in court was a fundamental right, and &sect; 12-2602 infringed that right. The court affirmed the superior court's determination that the complaint was timely served. Ariz. R. Civ. P. 4(i) gave real parties 120 days to serve process after filing the complaint. Ariz. R. Civ. P. 6(a) stated that time was computed without considering the date of filing, and excluded weekends from being counted as the last day.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged statute, Arizona Laws, Chapter 204, &sect; 2 (1997), only affected one county and temporarily suspended Az. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9-101.01, which allowed a city or town in the area of another community seeking to incorporate to either annex the community or grant it permission to incorporate separately. The state claimed that the city lacked standing to maintain the lawsuit. On appeal, the court held that the city had standing because it had a direct stake in seeing that Az. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9-101.01 was not suspended and that the city had a constitutional right to be free of any local or special law relating to incorporation that affected it adversely. The court also found that the suspension statute was unconstitutional special or local legislation because (1) there was no legitimate and rational basis for the law; (2) it did not must apply uniformly to all cases and to all members within the circumstances provided for by the law; and (3) it was not elastic, or open, not only to admit entry of additional persons, places, or things attaining the requisite characteristics, but also to enable others to exit the statute's coverage when they no longer had those characteristics.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor and aggravated driving with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more while his license was suspended. The trial court suspended the defendant's sentence and placed him on probation for four years. As a condition of probation, the court imposed a mandatory four-month prison sentence. On review, the defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting the results of his blood alcohol concentration test because the state failed to disclose the name and qualifications of the person who drew his blood. The court rejected that argument and found that, since the defendant's blood was drawn in a hospital, it could be presumed that it was drawn by a medical professional as contemplated by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-692(F). However, the court agreed with the defendant that he should have been given credit for the two days of presentence custody. Therefore, the court affirmed the convictions and modified the sentence.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 13-901.01(A) (Supp. 1997), which the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) failed to apply. Section &sect; 13-901.01(A) was part of The Drug Medicalization, Prevention, and Control Act of 1996 (Act), 1997 Ariz. Sess.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One defendant was convicted of possessing marijuana, and the other defendant was convicted of possessing a narcotic drug. Defendants committed their crimes before the effective date of the Act but were found guilty after the effective date.

Stat. &sect; 13-901.01(A) (Supp. 1997) governed the trial court's sentencing options. The court found that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1-246 (1995) was a clear and unequivocal expression of legislative intent that an offender's punishment was to be determined when he committed his offense. Furthermore, the court found that by construing &quot;convicted&quot; as defendants requested, the court would be construing the Act so as to render portions of it unconstitutional as an ex post facto law. The court concluded that &sect; 1-246 controlled the applicability of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-901.01(A) (Supp. 1997); therefore, &sect; 13-901.01(A) did not apply to defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the inmate's suit against officials and staff of the Department of Corrections for loss of personal property. It also ordered him to forfeit five days' earned release credits. The inmate argued that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-201.01(L), on which the dismissal was based, unconstitutionally abridged his right to petition the government by limiting his right to sue it, and to substantive due process because it denied him access to Arizona's courts. He also claimed the trial court improperly dismissed his 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 civil rights claim because Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-201.01(L) expressly allowed claims authorized by a federal statute. Lastly, he challenged the loss of earned release credits. The court partially affirmed. The inmate's loss of property did not implicate the right to petition the government. Furthermore, none of his claims alleged a &sect; 1983 claim. The court also found that negligent loss of his property did not amount to a denial of due process. However, it reversed the forfeiture of his credits under Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Maricopa County, Arizona, which convicted him under Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-2916(A) (1989), a statute that prohibited use of a telephone to threaten or intimidate. The defendant claimed that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad because it proscribed expression protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant argued that &sect; 13-2916(A) was so broadly written as to deter or constrain the freedom of expression of persons not before the court, and asserted standing to challenge the validity of the statute. The court found a colorable prospect of a real and substantial deterrence of legitimate expression under the statute, and exercised its discretion to grant the defendant standing to proceed with his claim. The court found that &sect; 13-2916(A) swept in a broad array of constitutionally protected speech in the form of threats to the person or property of another. The court found that &sect; 13-2916(A) was susceptible to arbitrary law enforcement and to chilling or deterrence of free speech. The court found that &sect; 13-2916(A) was facially violative of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and of Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 6. The court declined to attempt a narrowing construction to the statute. The court found that a statute must provide a reasonable degree of guidance both to those who wish to confine their behavior to the law and those who must enforce the law and, to meet that need, the legislature had to rewrite &sect; 13-2916 to redefine what telephonic conduct was proscribed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-2916(A) (1989) unconstitutionally overbroad. The court reversed the defendant's conviction and sentence and directed the entry of judgment of acquittal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver struck a barricade and filed a negligence claim against the contractor. The contractor moved to dismiss the complaint because the driver failed to file an expert affidavit as required by &sect; 12-2602. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 12-2602 placed the driver under a burden to which other tort claimants were not subjected. The court found that the statute: (1) required the driver to hire an expert where no expert may have been required; (2) limited the expert witnesses to other contractors; (3) required the driver to develop an expert case without the benefit of discovery; and (4) imposed these requirements as a condition precedent to filing the complaint upon the penalty of dismissal. Because the statute infringed upon his fundamental right to bring the action, the court applied the strict scrutiny test and held that &sect; 12-2602 was not necessary or the least restrictive practical means to prevent frivolous or nonmeritorious claims against registered professionals and contractors. The statute burdened all lawsuits against contractors and registered professionals and the legal system already provided the means to filter out frivolous and nonmeritorious suits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant school district board changed from an at-large voting system to a single member or &quot;ward&quot; voting system under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-431, plaintiff school district electors challenged the validity of the ward system and election. The Maricopa County Superior Court (Arizona) held that &sect; 15-431 was unconstitutional, invalidated the election, reseated the incumbents, and ordered a new at-large election. The board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court affirmed. The electors did have standing and &sect; 15-431 was unconstitutional. Because the statute was race-based, the court applied strict scrutiny. The court found no compelling interest where the record contained no evidence of historic racial discrimination and the legislature enacted the statute in response to mere claims of discrimination. The state's interest in avoiding litigation was not a compelling interest. Section 15-431 also was not narrowly tailored. The statute failed to limit its reach to discriminatory voting practices. Finally, even if only &sect; 15-431(B)(3) was unconstitutional, the statute fell because that subsection was not severable. Without that part of the statute, there was no means to determine which of the single member district seats would take office. Also, laches did not mandate dismissal of the electors' claims. The electors' actions of protesting to the Department of Justice and requesting an opinion from the Attorney General supported the trial court's determination not to apply laches. Finally, the newly seated board members were not validly elected and could continue to sit until their successors were validly elected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed and held that the election was invalid because the ward voting system statute was unconstitutional in its entirety. Because of laches, the remedy was limited to ordering a future election.</SPAN></P>

There was no such element in the offense of drive-by shooting. Thus, one crime could be committed without necessarily committing the other.

The county claimed the discount given to possessory interests, under class 12 and class 13 treatment violated the Uniformity Clause. The tax court denied the refunds and the constitutional challenge.

The possessory interests were not owned by the airlines, because they were tenants and lacked the ability to dispose of the interests and therefore were class 12 interests, which entitled the airlines to their refunds. The classifications had not violated the Uniformity Clause because the legislature had made a valid attempt based on the nature of the property to tax property that was otherwise not taxable because the owners were tax-exempt government entities.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, taxpayer and county, sought review of the decision of the Arizona Tax Court, which consolidated the taxpayer's action against the county and the state department of revenue and granted judgment in favor of the state department of revenue and denied the taxpayer's requests for a tax refund in the taxpayer's action challenging the constitutionality of tax statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer leased a majority of the land its resort was located on from a city. The county tax assessor determined that the taxpayer's possessory interest in the land did not qualify for a tax exemption or special valuation pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 42-162(A)(12) and (13), 42-271.01 through 42-271.03 or 42-683 through 42-685. The taxpayer paid the assessed taxes for two years under protest and filed separate actions against the county and the department of revenue which sought a determination that the tax statutes were unconstitutional and a refund of the taxes paid. The county agreed the tax scheme was unconstitutional, but denied the taxpayer was due a refund. The cases were consolidated and the trial court held that the tax scheme was constitutional and denied the taxpayer's request for a refund. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded with instructions to grant the taxpayer a refund and any other needed special relief. The court held that the tax scheme violated the Uniformity Clause of the Arizona Constitution, Ariz. Const. art IX, &sect; 1 and that a refund was the appropriate remedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Former students argued that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until they discovered the causal connection between their injuries and teacher's conduct. Former students also argued that a special tolling rule should be adopted for cases that involved the abuse of a child by an adult in a position of trust. The court held that precedent established by the state supreme court in another matter that was decided after former students' appeal was filed precluded a decision by the court in favor of former students. Because former students were capable of managing their ordinary daily affairs during the interval in which they were molested, they did not possess the requisite unsound mind required to toll the statute of limitations under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-502.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Unbeknownst to the employees, the employer had purchased from the telephone system manufacturer a system that blocked 9-1-1 service. Due to the inability to access 9-1-1 directly, emergency help was delayed when the employee suffered a heart attack, resulting in irreversible brain damage. The trial court granted summary judgment to the telephone system manufacturer. On appeal, the court ruled that although Ariz. Stat. Rev. &sect; 23-1023(B) effectively limited to one year the period of time within which one entitled to workers' compensation could bring a third party claim, &sect;12-502 applied to that limitation. Section 12-502 provided that if a person was entitled to bring an action was at the time of the cause of the action of unsound mind, the period of such disability should not be deemed a portion of the period limited for commencement. The court determined that since the employee had been rendered mentally incompetent by her industrial injury, &sect; 12-502 tolled the one year limitation of &sect; 23-1023(B) within which the employee could bring a third party action for damages. The court ruled that the time limit on the claims of the employee's family members was not tolled by &sect; 12-502.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff newspapers sought a declaratory judgment that defendant corrections department unconstitutionally discriminated against members of the media by denying them prison visitation privileges. The Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) dismissed the claim based on res judicata and awarded bad faith attorney's fees to corrections department. Newspapers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sharply criticized Arizona's same evidence test for finding res judicata, opining that a transactional test was more modern and preferable. Under the same evidence test, however, which was still in effect, newspapers' statement of slightly different facts and legal theory escaped the bar of res judicata. The court held, however, that there were no facts under which newspapers were entitled to relief. First, the state had a rational basis for excluding newspapers and others from prisons. Second, the Equal Protection Clause did not prohibit discrimination in favor of any group. The court held that the trial court erred in granting attorney's fees to corrections department, because the claim was not groundless; as determined above, the claim was not barred by res judicata. The trial court also failed to find that the suit was intended to harass the state, although it found it had a harassing effect. This was not sufficient under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-349, which required a finding of intent, groundlessness, and bad faith.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's ruling that newspapers' complaint was barred by res judicata. The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court reversed the trial court's award of attorneys' fees to corrections system.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the court ruled that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. The court also rejected defendant's contention that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3102(A)(3) was unconstitutionally vague because it did not define what constituted the &quot;barrel&quot; of a gun. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague because a term was undefined and susceptible to more than one meaning. The definition of barrel that the deputy sheriff used was consistent with a dictionary definition. Thus the court found no merit in defendant's attempt to include other portions of the weapon within the definition in an attempt to stretch the weapon involved beyond the common usage definition employed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the tax court's judgment that (1) the leasehold interest constituted a taxable possessory interest because the taxpayers obtained their leaseholds pursuant to an agreement with a governmental entity; (2) that the possessory tax was validly applied because federal law did not preempt the taxation of the leaseholds; and (3) that no equal protection violation occurred because the record contained no evidence that the county intended to or did treat other holders of taxable possessory interests any differently.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part defendant's convictions. Defendant contended that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on accomplice liability. The court held that if the jury believed defendant drove the car and his codefendant fired the shots, they could have concluded from the way defendant drove the car that he agreed to or attempted to aid in the offenses and was guilty as an accomplice. Defendant contended that there was a lack of evidence regarding two of the charges for aggravated assault. The court reversed the conviction on one of the charges because there was no evidence from which the jury could have concluded the victim was in reasonable apprehension of imminent physical injury. The court held that defendant lacked standing to challenge the gang statutes because he did not claim that his potentially innocent conduct was being prosecuted. Defendant argued that the trial court abused its discretion when it admitted evidence of gang activity by other gang members. The court found no error because the evidence had substantial probative value because it provided an essential element of proof that the gang was a criminal street gang.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the legislature could enact a statute which applied to juveniles who have been adjudicated delinquent and which required them to do something even after they reach the age of majority. The registration requirements of &sect;&sect; 13-3821 and 13-3822 did not violate any rule of confidentiality.

The juvenile argued that by exercising prescriptive power over the juvenile's minimum length of stay, the juvenile court unlawfully gave retroactive application to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-241(I).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile pled guilty to attempted child molestation. As a term of probation, he was required to reside at a residential treatment center. The juvenile ran away from the treatment center and later pled guilty to failing to attend school. Although the guidelines recommended a 9-12 month term, the juvenile court sentenced the juvenile to serve 24 months in a locked facility. On review, the juvenile argued that because he committed his delinquent act in December 1994 and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-241(I) did not take effect until September 30, 1995, the juvenile court was precluded under the statute and under the ex post facto clauses of the federal and state constitutions from imposing a minimum period of commitment for an act that preceded the statute's effective date. The appeals court interpreted the statute as extending the juvenile court's prescriptive power over the term of confinement in dispositions after September 30, 1995. Since this disposition took place in January 1996, the juvenile court was statutorily entitled to draw upon &sect; 8-241.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court affirmed the juvenile's sentence because the juvenile court did not err in applying the new statute retroactively since it merely regulated without increasing the penalty for an offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant individual contended that his conviction of a violation of Phoenix City, Ariz., Code &sect; 23-21, which proscribed the unauthorized wearing of the official insignia of the Phoenix Police Department, was in error. The court's review was limited to the facial validity of &sect; 23-21 because the action was instituted in municipal court and appealed to superior court. Defendant argued that &sect; 23-21 was preempted by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2406, thus invalidating the ordinance. The court stated that the ordinance barred the unauthorized use of a public officer's insignia on clothing. In contrast, the statute prohibited the impersonation of a public servant with the intent to induce another to submit to his faked authority. The court affirmed, holding that there was no conflict between &sect; 23-21 and &sect; 13-2406(A). Contrary to defendant's arguments, the court held that &sect; 23-21 was not vague or overbroad. Additionally, the court held that the city had a legitimate interest in regulating the use of its official insignia and the unauthorized use of it jeopardized the appearance of political neutrality and impartiality. Section 23-21 did not violate defendant's U.S. Const. amend. I rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the municipal code under which defendant individual was convicted was facially valid, did not conflict with state statute, and did not violate defendant's First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a default judgment and the purported wife sought to set aside the default. The court found that the purported husband was not legally entitled to the declaratory judgment he sought and that the marriage was invalid. The marriage license requirement did not conflict with the purported husband's exercise of his religion because obtaining a marriage license would not infringe on his ability to solemnize the marriage in a religious ceremony or to observe his religious beliefs within the marriage. The terms of the marriage contract were unenforceable because the contract did not establish a marriage. The purported husband was required to establish paternity before he could seek custody of his child. The entry of default against the purported wife operated as an admission of the facts, but the trial court could not have declared that the parties' marriage contract formed a valid marriage where it would have been contrary to Arizona law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state sought a special action following an order of respondent Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which found that Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-241(N), requiring the trial court to order human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing of a juvenile sex offender upon request of the victim, violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A juvenile was adjudicated delinquent on a charge of child molestation. The sexual act possibly exposed the victim to the juvenile's bodily fluids, and the victim's mother requested that the juvenile be tested pursuant to &sect; 8-241(N) for the presence of HIV. The trial court rejected the request, finding that an involuntary test for HIV was an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment and that any testing for HIV should be performed on the victim. The state appealed and the court reversed and remanded for further proceedings, concluding that the statute did not involve an unconstitutional search. The court determined that the use of an order instead of a warrant to implement the test was not a Fourth Amendment violation because the issuance of the order required the same judicial scrutiny that would be required of a warrant. The court held that the lack of a probable cause requirement was not unconstitutional because the hidden nature of the disease required that a test for its existence was subordinated to the special needs of the state. The statute bore a substantial relationship to the state's goal of assisting victims of sexual offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which found him delinquent after he admitted having rubbed his brother's penis while watching a video and, as terms of his probation, required that he be tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-241N and prohibited him from patronizing any place where sexually stimulating or oriented material was available.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 14 at the time of the offense and the victim, his brother, was five years old. The court held that &sect; 8-241(N) did not violate the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures when the juvenile's conduct could have possibly resulted in the transmission of HIV. The issue of unconstitutionally broad application of &sect; 8-241(N) was not framed for decision here because defendant's broader admission to a juvenile probation officer, which the trial court was entitled to consider, included acts that may have exposed the victim to defendant's bodily fluids. However, the court held that: (1) HIV testing should not have been imposed because neither the victim nor the victim's parent or guardian requested testing, as required by &sect; 8-241(N); and (2) the trial court's directive prohibiting defendant from patronizing any place where sexually stimulating or oriented material or entertainment was available was void for vagueness because many convenience stores, movie rental establishments, and multiplex movie theaters would have fallen within the broad language of the trial court's proscription.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the trial court's order requiring defendant to undergo HIV testing as a condition of probation, found that the probation condition prohibiting defendant from patronizing any place with sexually stimulating or oriented material or entertainment was unconstitutionally vague, remanded to permit the trial court to impose this term more narrowly drawn if it chose to do so, and found no infirmity in the remaining terms of probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant arose after his girlfriend's daughter died of apparent non-accidental head trauma or &quot;shaken baby syndrome.&quot; Defendant argued, inter alia, that he did not have &quot;the care or custody&quot; of the child so as to be convicted for child abuse for failing to seek medical care for her in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3623(B). The court affirmed defendant's conviction. There was more than sufficient evidence to find that defendant had &quot;care&quot; of the child because he voluntarily assumed responsibility for providing for the child, referred to her as his daughter, and assumed the role of primary care giver by dominating the child's mother and controlling all their income. The court also rejected defendant's argument that his conviction for felony murder should fail because a crime of omission could not serve as a predicate felony for felony murder. The use of the word &quot;acting&quot; in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1105, the felony murder statute, did not preclude crimes of omission when defendant had committed an offense that the legislature had specifically included as a basis for felony murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, student and his parents, sought review of an order from the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which dismissed, on motion, the complaint alleging that appellees, school and district, created an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of harm to the student by failing to maintain the school's playground, upon the court's determination that the school and district were immune under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-820.01 (1992).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court had held that school and district enjoyed absolute immunity under the statute because the failure to install cushioning under the swing set was a discretionary decision concerning the allocation of resources. On appeal, the student and his parents argued that the school and district were not immune from suit, as they had a common law duty to ensure that the facility did not pose an unreasonable risk of harm once the decision to provide playground equipment was made. The school and district argued that &sect; 12-820.01 provided immunity for acts that involved determinations of whether to provide resources for the purchase of equipment. The appellate court held that statutory immunity did not protect the school and district because they did not have the discretion to breach their duty to refrain from subjecting district students to unreasonable risks of harm. The appellate court noted that &sect; 12-820.01 did not answer the question of liability in the case, as the legislative intent to extend immunity to all resource allocation decisions was not apparent. However, under the common law, the school and district had a duty to make the premises safe for the students.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the appellate court affirmed the dismissal of the claim for negligent supervision, it reversed the dismissal of the claims concerning the condition of the school playground premises and remanded those claims for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The owner claimed that she neither knew nor should have known that the brother was going to carry marijuana in the truck. The owner appealed the superior court's decision, but the court dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction. The court explained that the owner had failed to serve a copy of her notice of appeal and a copy of her brief on the attorney general when she filed her brief with the court, as required by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2314(M). Hence, the court lacked jurisdiction over the appeal. Ariz. R. Civ. App. P. 8(a) did not apply, the court added, because Rule 8(a) only applied when the court had jurisdiction over the underlying subject matter. The court held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2314(M) did not unconstitutionally undermine the court's authority to make rules and that the requirement of sending copies of the notice of appeal and brief was not an unreasonable barrier to the owner's appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial testimony demonstrated that defendant made separate sales of crack cocaine base. Defendant was found guilty of sale of a narcotic drug under two counts. At sentencing, the prosecutor urged the trial court to deny probation because, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3408(D), defendant had sold a threshold amount of cocaine base, making him ineligible for probation. The trial court denied probation. Defendant alleged that because the finding of the threshold amount of cocaine was not determined by the jury, his convictions and sentences were unconstitutional. The court affirmed, holding that the finding of threshold amount was appropriately found by the trial court as a sentencing factor. The court noted that it was within the sole power of the legislature to prescribe punishment for criminal acts. Section 13-3408(D) simply dictated the weight to be given to the aggravating factor of threshold amount once defendant had been convicted of sale of a narcotic drug. The presence or absence of that factor did not modify the term of years for which defendant could be sentenced. The factor did not determine the class of felony and did not become a factor until after conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fire department extinguished a fire emanating from a storage unit. While in the unit, they saw several plants they recognized as marijuana. An officer, who was called to the scene, could see the marijuana through the open door.

Defendant was arrested and filed a motion to suppress the evidence. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant filed a special action contesting the denial of his motion to suppress. Because the action involved a constitutional issue of first impression in Arizona, the court accepted jurisdiction. The court held that: (1) the fact that the officer saw contraband in plain view did not allow him, absent exigent circumstances, to enter the unit without a warrant; (2) where the fire was extinguished and the marijuana was in no danger of being destroyed, there were no exigent circumstances permitting a warrantless entry; and (3) where the firefighters did not have authority to seize evidence of non-arson-related criminal activity, the police could not &quot;step in their shoes&quot; and seize the marijuana.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the city amended its zoning ordinance, the club continued its operations as a legal, non-conforming use.

After recovering possession, the operators were denied a license because the city refused to provide the zoning clearance, claiming that the club had lost its legal, non-conforming use status. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment and held that under Glendale, Az.

The parties have stipulated that the club owners and operators did not intend to continue to abandon this non-conforming use.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-1022(2)-(4) alleging discrimination against recipients of federal retirement income.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court entered formal judgment on mandate dismissing the taxpayers' complaint without prejudice due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction because plaintiffs did not exhaust administrative remedies. On appeal, the court reaffirmed the implicit holding of a decided case that the taxpayers' request for declaratory relief was an integral link in their bid for recovery of refunds and was therefore barred by their failure to resort to and exhaust administrative remedies. The court found the DOR's cross-appeal properly encompassed all relief the lower court granted pursuant to the taxpayers' second amended complaint. This relief included the fee award. The court's reversal of the taxpayers' bid for court-ordered refunds and declaratory relief necessarily ended their status as &quot;prevailing parties&quot; under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-348. Thus the lower court did not err in dismissing the taxpayers' complaint on remand, or in declining to conduct further proceedings with a view toward granting additional relief based on occurrences post-dating the decided case. But the tax court erred in awarding attorney fees against the taxpayers pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988.</SPAN></P>

The victims called the police, and defendant was apprehended because he fit the victims' description of the assailant. At trial, defendant maintained that he mistook the victims for his friends. One of the victims refused defense counsel's request for a pretrial interview. On cross-examination, defense counsel asked the victim whether he had refused a pretrial interview. The trial court sustained the state's objection. Defendant argued that the restriction on cross-examination violated his right to confrontation. The court found that the restriction on cross-examination had violated defendant's right to confrontation because the victim's refusal to be interviewed may have reflected on the victim's credibility. However, the court affirmed the judgment, finding harmless error. Specifically, the victims' testimony was plausible, consistent, and partially corroborated by defendant's own admissions; in short, the evidence of defendant's guilt was very strong.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant claimed that business records and expert testimony were improperly admitted into evidence at his trial and that his right to confrontation was violated when he was not permitted to examine a victim about the victim's refusal to allow a pre-trial interview. With respect to defendant's objection regarding the admission of the bank statements and the signature card, the court held that whether the records were sufficiently reliable to be admitted was left to the sound discretion of the trial court. Moreover, the court found that because the statements evidenced that there were insufficient funds in the bank account, and defendant had already admitted there were insufficient funds any error was harmless. Moreover, the court held that the bank employee's opinion with respect to the forged signatures was properly admitted and insignificant. Lastly, the court found that defendant's inquiry into the victim's exercise of the right to decline a pre-trial interview was improper because it would be fundamentally unfair to allow the victim's exercise of this constitutional right to be burdened by consequent attacks at trial.</SPAN></P>

He asserted that the trial court erred by concluding that it was required to revoke his probations under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-917(B) with regard to his intensive probations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of a dangerous drug, attempted sale of a dangerous drug, and theft. The trial court placed him on intensive probation for the first two counts, and on supervised probation on the theft count. When defendant tested positive for methamphetamine, his probation officer filed a petition to revoke the probations for violating standard condition nine, which prohibited the use of controlled substances. After a revocation hearing, the trial court found that defendant had violated his probations and, pursuant to &sect; 13-917(B), revoked the probations and imposed prison terms. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed in part. It explained that, under &sect; 13-917(B), once a petition was filed, the statute required revocation if a trial court found that a defendant had committed a felony offense. Here it was undisputed that defendant committed a felony. He used methamphetamine, a dangerous drug, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3401(6)(b)(xii), which was a class 4 felony, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3407(A)(1), (B)(1). The court reversed in part because Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-917(B) did not apply to the supervised probation for theft.  Ariz. Rev.

The trial court, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-603(J) (renumbered as Ariz. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At sentencing the trial court expressed regret that it had to impose prison time and found the sentence clearly excessive. The trial court entered a special order allowing defendant to petition for a commutation of his sentence. In support of the order, the trial court cited defendant's lack of prior felony convictions, his need for anger control counseling and treatment, and the fact that he was the father of an infant daughter. On appeal, defendant argued that the sentencing scheme was unconstitutional. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The court found that the trial court had the duty to not impose a sentence that was grossly disproportionate under the Eighth Amendment. Absent such a finding, though, the trial court had no constitutional authority to impose a sentence that was any less severe than the range of sentences prescribed by the legislature. The mere fact that defendant had the additional remedy of seeking commutation of his sentence worked to his benefit. Defendant's crime was a violent crime involving the use of a deadly weapon. The court determined that a prison term of five years was not grossly disproportionate to defendant's crime.</SPAN></P>

The list was non-exclusive and allowed consideration of other behaviors, that manifested an intent to solicit prostitution. The court concluded that given the specific behavioral evidence needed to support the inference of intent, the statute was not vague. The court also reasoned that although criminalization of the isolated lawful behaviors listed in the ordinance would be unconstitutional, the ordinance did not criminalize those lawful activities in isolation from intent and context, thus the ordinance was not overbroad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from an order of the Superior Court of Pima County, Arizona, which dismissed an indictment charging defendant with causing criminal damage in an amount more than $ 2,000 but less than $ 10,000, a class five felony under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1602(A), (B)(2), based on its finding that the statute was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it defined the class of felony based on the amount of damage inflicted but did not specify how that amount was to be calculated. He alleged that the statute permitted an arbitrary and discriminatory application. The court disagreed. The court held that defendant could only be convicted of causing such damage as the proof would support, given properly recognized measures of damages. There were several appropriate methods of determining damages. The amount had to be determined by applying a rule of reasonableness to the particular fact situation presented. The State had the burden to establish the amount of damages, which defendant could challenge with his own more reasonable calculation. The jury would have been required to decide which was more reasonable. Thus, a conviction for criminal damage was based on the evidence presented, given generally accepted measures of damages, and not on the whim of the police, prosecutor, judge, or jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant newspaper challenged a finding of the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which granted summary judgment to appellee state in an action filed to declare Ariz.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A newspaper sought a copy of the county voter registration list. The newspaper was told that it would have to comply with Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 16-168(E). The statute required that the newspaper pay for the list, on a per name basis. The cost to the newspaper would have been prohibitive. The newspaper filed an action to have the statute declared unconstitutional, as violative of Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 13, as special legislation, and against public policy. The trial court granted the state's motion for summary judgment. The newspaper appealed. As to the constitutional question, the court applied the rational basis test and found that there existed a reasonable state interest in not providing the list free of charge, which was to protect the privacy of the voters. The court also found that the statute was not &quot;special legislation&quot; by allowing political parties free copies while charging everyone else, in that there was a rational basis for the statute and class members could move back and forth between groups. The court finally found that public policy was not violated because the list was available to anyone, just at a cost.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured person was playing softball for his company's team on a field within the city's park as part of a softball league and was injured. His company paid a fee to the city to play in the league. The trial court dismissed his cause of action. The court reversed because the injured person was not a &quot;recreational user&quot; as defined in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 33-1551 and the city was thus not immune from suit. The injured person was injured on a softball field during the course of an official, city-sponsored league softball game. The participation of his team and its members depended on the team's required payment of an entry fee to the city. That payment was made with the understanding that this entry fee was a requirement of entering a team into the league and to use the league facilities. Part of the entry fee was for field preparation, which included maintenance personnel dragging the field and chalking the lines and stripes and installing bases, and part of the entry fee was allocated towards the light use fee for the softball fields at night use. But for the payment of the entry fee, the injured person could not have used the softball field at the time his accident occurred.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court held that the conviction was not predicated simply on defendant's act of advising or counseling the gang as to noncriminal matters. The statute proscribed such advice only when it was given with the intent to promote or further the criminal objectives of a criminal syndicate pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-308(A)(3). Words spoken with the intent to cause the commission of a criminal act were not protected by the First Amendment. Defendant also objected to various exhibits with gang insignia on them. The court found that the writing on these exhibits was not offered to prove the truth of any of the words contained therein, but rather as evidence of the knowledge and gang participation of the possessor. For that reason, they were not hearsay, and the identity of their author was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) which entered a directed verdict in favor of defendant mental health centers. In her complaint, the wife alleged that the mental health centers owed a duty, not only to her husband, their patient, but also to herself and their child. She also alleged that the mental health centers breached their duty of care by refusing to hospitalize her husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following sporadic treatment by the mental health centers, their patient stabbed his wife. The mental health centers were aware that the patient had thoughts of injuring his wife, but he did not communicate any express threat of imminent serious physical harm to her. At trial, the court held that the wife had failed to establish the mental health centers' liability under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-517.02. To establish statutory liability, the wife was required to show that the patient had communicated to the mental health provider an explicit threat of imminent serious physical harm or death to a clearly identified victim. On appeal, the court agreed that the wife had not stated a valid claim under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-517.02. However, the evidence was sufficient to support a prima facie claim of liability under Arizona case law. The court held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-517.02&nbsp;unconstitutionally abrogated a general negligence cause of action for persons who were not &quot;clearly identified&quot; by a patient but who were foreseeable victims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court's directed verdict, which was based solely on a statute which had unconstitutionally abrogated a cause of action, could not stand. The judgment for defendants was reversed because the wife had established a prima facie common law claim against the mental health centers for a breach of their duty to her.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that price discounts were not among the prohibited acts delineated in the ordinance, so the citizen did not expressly state violations of the ordinance. The court concluded that the question of whether age-related discounts fell within the ordinance were matters involving interpretation of the ordinance, so the division was entitled to exercise its judgment and discretion in determining the scope of the ordinance since it was charged with enforcing it. The court concluded that mandamus was not available, because the division had discretion to determine whether the citizen had stated a colorable claim. The court found that prohibiting age-related discounts was not an intended objective or construction of the ordinance, so the city's establishment of numerous mandatory senior citizen discounts was a clear indication of legislative intent, as well as a reflection of widely accepted public policy. The court concluded that the age-based discounts complained of had a sufficiently rational basis, and therefore did not deny the citizen the equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility companies contended that &sect; 15-992(B) was constitutional and that the tax court erred in holding that the 1990 amendments to &sect;&sect; 15-992(B) and 42-227(A) applied retroactively. One utility company also contended that the tax court's dismissal of its refund complaint during the pendency of its bankruptcy proceeding violated automatic stay provisions. The court held that the 1990 amendment to &sect; 15-992(B) was an unconstitutional special law but did not address other constitutional challenges. Because the unconstitutional amendment is void, the court held that its predecessor statute,&nbsp;&sect; 15-992(B)(1989), which included all assessed property in the class of taxpayers in those affected districts, was automatically revived. Although the court applied its decision retroactively, the court held that the utility companies were only entitled to a partial refund of the taxes they paid. The court held that &sect; 42-2271(A) was properly given retroactive application. Finally, the court held that the tax court's dismissal of one utility company's claim for failure to pay a subsequently levied tax after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy violated automatic stay.</SPAN></P>

They challenged their convictions for filing a false campaign contribution statement and conspiracy and bribery charges respectively.

Appellants asserted that the destruction of the evidence violated their right to due process of law under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 4. The court rejected the argument, stating that the potential evidence lost because of the alleged destruction of the notes did not warrant dismissal as the evidence was cumulative impeachment evidence. Appellants made no showing that the notes might have contained information not otherwise available to them. Thus the trial court correctly concluded that the notes were not constitutionally material and that the destruction of the notes did not violate appellants' constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

He had two prior felony convictions and was sentenced to three consecutive life terms on the sexual conduct and molestation charges and concurrent sentences of 12 years on the obscene material charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested in August 1992, after more than one year of sexual behavior with four boys. At trial, two brothers, both minors, testified to several instances in which defendant had engaged in sexual behavior with them. The brothers and a minor friend, who lived in the same trailer park as defendant, described the sexual acts and testified that defendant had made them watch pornographic videos while he masturbated. Defendant then moved to another trailer park and engaged in sexual conduct with another minor. He was convicted of sexual conduct with a minor, molestation, and furnishing obscene material to minors. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the trial court did not err in allowing the jury to determine without expert testimony if a video tape contained material that was harmful to minors. The court found that under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3501(1)(a), to convict defendant of furnishing obscene or harmful material to minors, the jury had to apply contemporary state standards with respect to what was suitable for minors. The court reasoned that expert testimony was only appropriate when the trier of fact could not understand the evidence.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2909. She was sentenced to five days in jail, a $ 210.00 fine, and one year of probation. Defendant was walking back and forth, carrying a bible and praying aloud in front of the home of a doctor whose practice included abortions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court construed Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2909 as prohibiting only focused picketing taking place solely in front of a particular residence; therefore, the statute was not overbroad and violative of the First Amendment in that context. The court found that whether or not defendant ranged at times beyond the doctor's home, the evidence permitted the conclusion that she targeted his home. The court found that in the context of a prohibition against targeted residential picketing, the term &quot;picket&quot; had a singular, commonly understood meaning and thus was not vague. The court found that the term &quot;demonstrates&quot; gave adequate notice of the conduct that &sect; 13-2909 proscribed. Thus, the court found that &sect; 13-2909 was not void for vagueness. The court found that the state imposed reasonable restrictions on the time, place, and manner of speech: &sect; 13-2909 was content-neutral, &sect; 13-2909 left open ample alternate channels of communication, and &sect; 13-2909 served a significant government interest of protecting residential privacy. The court affirmed and concluded that the statute did not single out religious &quot;picketing&quot; or &quot;demonstrations&quot; for prohibition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the portion of the amended sentencing statute that allowed for sentence commutation was a significant change in the law that should be given retroactive effect. Defendant requested a &quot;surgically precise&quot; application of the amendment provision because application of the entire amended statute would have eliminated her parole eligibility in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause, U.S. Const. art. I., &sect; 10, cl. 1. On appeal, the court held that criminals are sentenced under the law in effect when the crime was committed. The court noted that Arizona statutes were not given retroactive effect unless the legislature clearly evinced such an intention, and held that in this case, the legislature clearly indicated in 1993 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 255, &sect;&sect; 99 and 101 that the amendment operated prospectively. The court also held that the parole non-eligibility provision did not offend the executive powers of clemency under Ariz. Const. art. 5, &sect; 5. The court rejected an argument that defendant was entitled to equitable relief and found that defendant was not eligible for parity review by the Board of Executive Clemency.</SPAN></P>

His appeal and his first post-conviction relief petition were denied. He filed a second petition, which the trial court also denied. On appeal, the court affirmed. When it dismissed the prisoner's petition without awaiting the state's response, the trial court was able to consider preclusion pursuant to Ariz. R. Crim. P. 32.2(a)(2), (3). Because the prisoner had raised issues of ineffective assistance of counsel in his appeal and his first post-conviction relief petition, the prisoner had already had the benefit of an evidentiary hearing at which the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel had been explored. Although the prisoner claimed that the alibi instruction given at his trial was constitutionally infirm, he had not raised the issue previously, and the issue lacked sufficient constitutional magnitude to justify the prisoner's belated focus. The trial court had already held that the prisoner had not been entitled to a sexual abuse instruction. The prisoner could not argue that his earlier failure to raise these claims was due to ineffective assistance of counsel. Such an argument would have created an infinite regression.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer challenged the decision of the Arizona Tax Court that sustained the legality of property tax assessments on its parcels and improvements. The county challenged the determination that the taxpayer could not be held liable for additional taxes resulting from the transfer of improvements from the unsecured to the secured roll. The Department of Revenue challenged the order assessing it for failing to comply Ariz. R. Civ. P. Rule 26.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer claimed that because its improvements to the real estate were improperly assessed on the unsecured roll, it was entitled to a full refund of all taxes paid as a result of the assessment. The county argued that it was error to fail to require the taxpayer to pay the additional taxes accrued when the improvements were transferred from the unsecured roll to the secured roll, and the Department of Revenue argued that it was improper to assess it penalties for failing to comply with mandatory discovery. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court concluded that the taxpayer was not entitled to a full refund merely because of an incorrect assessment. Instead, the court held that the taxpayer was entitled to a refund if any excess taxes had been paid. The court found no authority in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-204 which would have permitted the county to be awarded the additional taxes that accrued when the improvements were transferred to the secured roll.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the decision of the Superior Court of Yavapai County (Arizona), which dismissed the charges against defendant under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-1015 for wagering on the outcome of an election based on the trial court's finding that &sect; 16-1015 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with violations of &sect; 16-1015 for wagering on the outcome of an election after such wager between defendants appeared as a public announcement in a newspaper. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the charges that the trial court denied. Defendants filed a petition for special action with the appellate court. The appellate court dismissed the charges and held that &sect; 16-1015 was unconstitutional. On further appeal, the court held that &sect; 16-1015 was not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. It was not vague on its face because the words were understandable by people of ordinary intelligence who, therefore, had notice of the prohibited conduct, and law enforcement officials were given guidelines for enforcement. Section 16-1015 did not infringe on defendants' right to free speech because the wager was not a particularized message nor was there a great likelihood that the message would be understood by those who viewed it. The statute sought to punish conduct, had only an incidental affect on free speech, and restricted free speech no greater than what was essential to further the substantial governmental interest of regulating gambling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the appellate court that found the statute that prohibited wagering on the outcome of elections to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona), which forfeited to the state government an amount of currency that was found within defendant's vehicle in close proximity to illegal drugs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer stopped defendant's vehicle after he observed it speeding. The officer smelled an odor of marijuana and found a bag of marijuana and a box of currency totaling $ 313,500 in the vehicle. Defendant pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of marijuana weighing less than one pound. The trial court forfeited the amount of currency to the state. The court held that, under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4311(K), the government had the initial burden of demonstrating probable cause for forfeiture. Here, the government did not demonstrate reasonable grounds for its belief that the property was subject to forfeiture. The statutory inference of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4305(B), that money found in proximity to contraband was used in the commission of the offense, was insufficient by itself to establish probable cause. There was no additional evidence connecting the currency to any criminal activity. Thus, the court held that the statutory inference of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4305(B) was but one factor that might be considered in determining probable cause for seizure and for forfeiture. A determination of probable cause which rested solely on the inference was constitutionally impermissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded with directions to dismiss the case with prejudice. The government's evidence was constitutionally inadequate to support a finding of probable cause for forfeiture of the currency found in defendant's vehicle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff resident challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which granted defendant town's motion for summary judgment, ruling that the failure to file the statement of organization invalidated the signatures because the circulator of the petition failed to identify himself and his organization. The resident had sought to compel the town clerk to submit the signatures to the county recorder for verification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident sought to have a zoning issue referred to the voters. After the resident submitted the petition signature sheets, the town clerk refused to transmit them to the county recorder for verification because the sheets contained 10, rather than 15, signature lines and because the resident had not submitted the statement of organization form before he and others collected the signatures. The trial court granted the town's motion for summary judgment, ruling that the failure to file the statement of organization invalidated the signatures. The trial court also ruled that the fact that the signature sheets contained 10 signature lines rather than 15 lines was not a sufficient reason to invalidate the petitions. On appeal, the court reversed. The court determined that although the resident and his group were a political committee within the definition of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-901(15), the statutes and the forms supplied to applicants are so confusing that they set a trap for those who are trying to exercise their right to seek a referendum. The trial court correctly held that the petition was not defective because the forms contained only 10 rather than 15 signature lines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court with respect to the issue whether the petition was defective because no statement of organization was filed. The court remanded to the trial court with directions to enter an order granting summary judgment to the resident and directing the town clerk to forward the referendum petition to the Maricopa County Recorder for processing. Finally, the court awarded attorney's fees to the resident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) dismissed plaintiff property owners' negligence action against defendants, architect, structural engineer, general contractor, and subcontractor, as barred by the construction statute of limitations, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-552. The trial court also awarded attorney's fees against the property owners under Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-341.01(A). The property owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners filed a negligence action against the architect, structural engineer, general contractor, and subcontractor, when the canopy to their building blew off in a windstorm causing extensive exterior and interior damage. The trial court dismissed the action as being barred by the construction statute of repose, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-552. On appeal, the court found that by its plain terms, &sect; 12-552 applied only to contract actions and not to negligence actions. Thus, &sect; 12-552's eight-year limitations period did not apply to bar the action. The court found that application of &sect; 12-552 to the property owners' negligence action would have rendered the statute unconstitutional because it would have abrogated the property owners' cause of action in violation of Ariz. Const. art. 18, &sect; 6. The court also found that because the legislature did not expressly provide that Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-552 preempted tort claims, it should not have been construed as preempting the property owners' negligence action. The court also found that attorney's fees were not available under Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-341.01(A) because that statute applied only to contract actions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of dismissal and reversed the award of attorney's fees against the property owners.</SPAN></P>
