</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee debtor failed to pay for merchandise purchased from appellant judgment creditor. The trial court issued a garnishment judgment against appellee under the then existing statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:3881, as amended in 1960, which allowed for an exemption of 80 percent of appellee's wages from seizure. Appellant stopped receiving any of appellee's wages after the passage of Act 242 of 1970, which amended &sect; 13:3881 and altered the amount exempt from garnishment. The trial court refused to apply the new provision and the court affirmed. Appellant showed that it had a vested right to seize appellee's salary prior to the passage of the Act and that its retrospective application adversely affected this right. A statute depriving a judgment creditor of the right to seize a portion of a debtor's salary by reason of a change in the amount of the exemption was a deprivation of a vested right. Once judgment of garnishment was rendered, appellant had a vested right to the non-exempt portion of appellee's salary, including unearned future wages and earned wages, and it could not permit the application of a statute which would destroy that right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court that refused to apply a new provision of an act, which amended a statute that existed at the time that appellant judgment creditor obtained a garnishment judgment against appellee debtor. Appellant had a vested right to the non-exempt portion of appellee's salary and the retroactive application of a statute that deprived appellant of that right was not permissible.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. art. 48:441 et seq., defendant lessee challenged a decision of the trial court (Louisiana), which rendered judgment in favor of defendant lessor but did not award the lessee the value of its improvements situated on the expropriated land and damages to those improvements on the remaining leased premises.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessor owned property, part of which it leased to the lessee. The state department of highways expropriated a portion of the lessor's property, including the lessee's leasehold. Located on the leased premises, however, were improvements erected by the lessee. The trial judge ruled in favor of the lessor for the sum of $ 11,535, which it accepted in full settlement of its claim. The demands of the lessee for the value of its improvements situated on the expropriated land and damages to those improvements on the remaining leased premises were rejected. The lessee appealed. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision, holding that the taking of the improvements through expropriation or their destruction without compensation to the lessee violated the constitutional prohibition against the taking or damaging of private property without just and adequate compensation. The court therefore held that the lessee was entitled to an award of the value of property taken or damaged as a result of expropriation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed an order from the District Court (Louisiana) that issued a permanent injunction barring defendants, state officials and the insurers the state's employees, from effecting an insurance premium increase, on grounds that the increase was privately negotiated, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:174.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State employees were covered by numerous group health and life insurance policies obtained by the various state agencies from numerous insurance companies. Pursuant to an executive order issued by the state's governor, the Commissioner of the Division of Administration, through private negotiations, consolidated all insurance coverage for the state's employees, which necessitated a premium increase. Plaintiffs sought to preliminarily enjoin the increase on grounds that the private negotiations violated the competitive bidding mandate of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:174. Defendants contended that &sect;&sect; 42:821 and 42:851 governed the transaction. The trial court read in pari materia &sect;&sect; 39:174, 42:821, and 42:851 and issued a permanent injunction against the increase. On appeal the court reversed holding that the legislative history of the statutes indicated that they were not to be read in pari materia and, as such, the state's procurement of the insurance was governed by &sect;&sect; 42:821 and 42:851.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Reversed and rendered; the trial court improperly read the insurance and public employees statutes in pari materia when it concluded that the competitive bidding statutes applied to the defendants' procurement or making of contracts of group life and group health insurance for the state's employees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant theater owners sought review of a decision of the lower court (Louisiana), which, in proceedings under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 13:4711-4717, were adjudged to be maintaining a public nuisance of obscenity. Their theater was ordered padlocked for a year and the owners were perpetually enjoined from carrying on or permitting the practice of obscenity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners operated a motion picture theater that showed pornographic films. Proceedings were instituted against them by appellee citizens' organization pursuant to the Louisiana injunction statute. After a full hearing, the lower court ordered the theater closed for a year and enjoined the owners and lessee from further obscene behavior. The owners filed a motion for suspensive appeal that was denied. The court granted certiorari because the key provision of the statutory scheme, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4712, had been declared unconstitutional. The court modified the decision of the lower court so that the owners did not have to post a bond to release the building under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4715, and, as modified, affirmed the judgment. The court found that, with the modification, the statute was constitutional as applied to the owners because they were not prevented from operating the theater until after a judicial decision had been made upon a contradictory hearing. The court held that the previous finding of the unconstitutionality of the statute had to be understood in the context of an ex parte prior restraint and thus did not apply to the owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the lower court was amended to delete the order closing and padlocking the owners' premises. In all other respects the judgment of the lower court was affirmed, including the order enjoining both the owners and lessee from permitting the continued existence of the statutory nuisance of obscenity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon prosecution of an action against her former husband for support for herself and their children, the former wife secured an order from the trial court authorizing her to prosecute the action in forma pauperis. After rendering a judgment condemning the former husband to make support payments for the children, and impliedly rejected the former wife's demand for support for herself, the trial court required the former wife to file an appeal bond prior to prosecuting a devolutive appeal from the rejection of the support she demanded for herself. After issuing a writ of certiorari to review the propriety of requiring the former wife to file an appeal bond, the court held that the trial court erred in concluding that the exclusion of divorce actions from the general rule laid down in La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 5181 (1964), that persons unable to pay litigation costs because of poverty may prosecute actions in a trial or appellate court without paying costs in advance applied to the former wife's action. The improper bond requirement was treated as surplusage and the court agreed to consider the former wife's appeal without the filing of a bond.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment permanently enjoining the theatre from showing any version of the motion picture entitled &quot;The Stewardesses.&quot; The lower court found the motion picture to be a nuisance under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4711, and then proceeded to enjoin the motion picture under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4712. The court held that a temporary restraining order forbidding the exhibition or publication of a form of expression issued pursuant to &sect; 13:4712 was defective and must be vacated because &sect; 13:4712 did not give a trial judge presented with a verified petition for injunction any discretion as to whether or not to issue a temporary injunction. Furthermore, the court found that &sect; 13:4712 was unconstitutional as applied to expression because it contained no guarantee of a prompt judicial decision. As such, the court held that the deficiencies with &sect; 13:4712 rendered it unconstitutional as applied to expression, and it could no longer form the basis for a temporary restraining order or permanent injunction against the exhibition or publication of suspected obscenity.</SPAN></P>

However, the trial court erred when it failed to consider the company's claim for a personal judgment against the owner under paragraph three of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:4812. The court stated that the company clearly qualified for enforcement of its claim against the owner personally because it named the owner a party defendant in his original petition, the cause of action was set out in detail, and the complaint prayed for all general and equitable relief.

Const. art. 1, &sect; 2 prohibited deprivation of life, liberty, or property except by due process of law. The constitutional prohibition was unqualified, liberty could not be taken, not in any degree, except by due process. The court held that the prohibition against driving a car entailed in a licensing statute could only be constitutionally effective if the substantive due process suited to legislative enactment was had. The court stated that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:414B(2) allowed for court action to determine the validity of a license suspension. The court concluded that although it was costlier for a licensed driver to initiate court action, the possibility of court action prior to an effective suspension satisfied the minimal due process requirement of La. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 2 and 6. In addition, the court stated that the burden never shifted from the state to the licensed driver although the licensed driver was required to initiate a court action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The daughter was suspended for three days due to her involvement in an altercation. The father filed suit the next morning, alleging that the daughter was the victim of the assault and that the suspension would cause her to miss her exams, resulting in irreparable damage. The defendants replied that the suit was premature because &sect; 416 required the parent to appeal the suspension to the school superintendent first. The trial court refused to dissolve the temporary injunction. The court held that the suit was premature and that the parent could be required to follow the administrative appeals procedure before seeking judicial review. The court rejected the argument that the statute violated La. Const. art. VII, &sect;&sect; 35-36, which vested the court with jurisdiction to review administrative actions, because there was no provision for judicial review of suspensions, but only for expulsions. The court interpreted the statute to allow for review of suspensions after the administrative appeal was complete.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court found that the licensee violated &sect; 26:88(7), which prohibited a liquor licensee to employee women to solicit drinks from patrons at a higher price than normally paid and receive the additional money paid as a commission. Contrary to the licensee's claims, the court held that &sect; 26:88(7) was not discriminatory. The licensee argued that there was not sufficient evidence to support the contention that the women received a commission or remuneration. The court noted that the price differential between the drinks that the male police officers ordered and those drinks which were solicited by the females was not sufficient evidence by itself. However, the additional facts that (1) one of the women was also employed as a waitress; (2) the females solicited two rounds of drinks from the officers; (3) a round of drinks appeared without being ordered; and (4) the events occurred within a very brief period of time all support the conclusion that the females were not rendering their services gratuitously, that at least one was an employee and that they did actually receive remuneration for their efforts in violation of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the legislature intended La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:1803 to apply to the board in that it expressly named the board. The court also found that the legislature expressly reserved to itself the authority to regulate the board's authority pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 17:1421-1491. The court concluded that La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 7 was not self-executory; that it was limited to the creation of an agency whose rights, powers, and duties were to be prescribed by the legislature. To vest in the board such powers as it should see fit to assume, free of legislative control, could not be judicially sanctioned in the absence of clear legislative intent to create an agency devoid of legislative control.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Commission's request, the taxpayer filed a property tax report in which it listed furniture and fixtures but failed to show loans secured by mortgage, personal endorsement, and floor plan notes secured by trust receipts. The Commission levied a tax against the taxpayer's intangible credits. The taxpayer brought an action to annul the assessments, alleging that the intangibles upon which the taxes were levied are exempt from taxation under La. Const. of 1921 art. X, &sect; 4, para. 3. The district court sustained the Commission's exception of no right of action, finding that because the taxpayer was attacking the amount assessed and because the taxpayer failed to timely filed its sworn list or return of property, the action had to be dismissed. On appeal, the court held that because the thrust of the taxpayer's action addressed the issue of whether the tax could be constitutionally imposed upon the intangibles, the taxpayer was not required to comply with the requirements of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1998 but could urge the nullity of the assessment at any time.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After dismissal of his injunctive action, the commissioner challenged, contending that the trial court erred in finding that merely because he did not allege the prospect of future violations, that the petition was invalid. The livestock dealer filed a motion to dismiss the appeal because the commissioner had failed to provide the record for appeal, and that the delay was imputable to the commission employer under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. arts. 2126 and 2127. The court held that the delay was not attributable to the commissioner because the clerk of the court responsible for preparation of the record acknowledged that the error was his fault. Accordingly, the court denied the dealer's motion to dismiss the appeal. Additionally, the court therefore reversed the trial court's dismissal of the commissioner's action, and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that the complaint adequately stated a cause of action for injunctive relief. There was no need to plead a fear of future violations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant finance company disputed a judgment by a district court (Louisiana), which, after entering a default judgment and a garnishment judgment against appellee debtor, modified the garnishment judgment to reflect the increased exemption from seizure provided by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:3881(1), as amended. The company argued that &sect; 13:3881(1), as amended, could not be given retroactive effect and to do so would be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The original garnishment judgment provided that the withholding by the debtor's employer should not encroach upon the minimum amount exempt from seizure by law, which was $ 100 per month before the amendment of &sect; 13:3881(1). After the amendment, the debtor proceeded by rule against the company and the district court modified the judgment to reflect an increase in the exemption. On appeal, the court reviewed the rules of construction applicable to the prospective and retroactive effect of statutes and the interrelationship of such rules with the contract clauses of U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10 and La. Const. art. 4, &sect; 15. The court held that, if &sect; 13:3881(1), as amended, were to be applied retroactively, the company's rights under the pre-existing contract and judgments would be substantially and materially impaired. It would be effectively barred from enforcement of the debtor's obligation under its contract and judgment. Policy and social objectives did not justify a violation of the constitutional prohibition against impairment of contract. The vested rights of the company stemmed from the original contract and the judgment rendered thereon, not from the garnishment judgment as such.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs initiated a suit against the treasurer of the State of Louisiana, and sought to have several acts declared unconstitutional. The main thrust of the plaintiffs' position was that the provisions of La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 40 prohibited the increase of the salaries of the judges of Supreme Court, of the Court of Appeal, and of the District Court, and that if a general pronouncement had any application whatever with respect to the salaries of sitting judges, it could have effect only with reference to a sitting judge when his term expired and he was reelected for another term. The trial court granted summary judgment for defendant and dismissed the action. The court affirmed, holding that the drafters of the Louisiana Constitution of 1921 did not intend or envision that the language used in La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 40 should be interpreted in such a manner that judges elected or appointed after the adoption of a legislative pay raise could collect the raise, and their elders in service could not do so until their terms had expired.

The Civil Service Commission granted board a dismissal because it did not satisfy La. Civ.

The court held that the filing of the motion in arrest of judgment was not timely in that it was not filed before sentence. The court further ruled that the enactment of La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence in the record amply sustains the finding of the trial judge that the companion and decedent began living together about twenty-seven years ago without the benefit of marriage, and that they both knew that the employee was already married and could not legally contract another marriage. With this knowledge, the companion could not attain the status of a putative wife. Consequently, the trial court rendered judgment rejecting the companion's demands. The companion contended that the statutory or jurisprudential law that prohibited her recovery of benefits was a deprivation of her rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court judgment based on the determination that the case of Humphreys v. Marquette Casualty Company, 235 La. 355, 103 So.2d 895 (1958), which had ruled adversely in regard to the specific areas of law under consideration, was still be the controlling law of the state on the question, and the court was constrained to follow the decision.</SPAN></P>

The general obligation bond issue was properly submitted to all qualified voters under Act 377 of 1970, &sect;&sect; 1, 2. The procedures set forth in &sect; 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1973c (1965), did not apply to any changes made by Act 377 of 1970 because to do so would defeat the purpose of the law.</SPAN></P>

The city denied the request on grounds that a portion of the plat occupied a right of way of a proposed extension of an existing road. The property owner argued that the proposed extension was part of a master plan, which had not been recorded, as required, in the clerk of court's office, and therefore invalid. The property owner also asserted that the denial of the plan, and the proposed extension constituted an uncompensated taking of property. The trial court ruled in favor of the property owners and ordered the city to approve the plat and that the building inspector issue a permit. The city appealed, contending that it acted within its police powers, that it did not act in an arbitrary manner, and that the property owners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. The court affirmed the lower court's ruling on grounds the city's refusal to approve the plan unless the property owner accommodated the proposed extension violated the constitutional prohibition against a taking of property for public use without fair value being paid.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. art. 161 had been reenacted and amended, pursuant to 1970 La. Act 739, four months after the legislature repealed it. The court held that 1970 La. Act 739 was the last expression of the legislature's will and acted to repeal all parts of 1970 La. Act 317; since the husband's marriage occurred during the period exempted by the validating provision of 1970 La.

The district judge found that, despite the mandatory language of &sect; 11.09, the council had discretion to refuse to call the election if the amendment was invalid. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. According to the court, as a general proposition of law, the validity or constitutionality of an ordinance would not be determined or passed on by a court until the ordinance was adopted. However, the court held that pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 3863, mandamus would not lie to compel the performance of a discretionary act, no matter how flagrant an abuse of that discretion might exist. The court held that the council had the discretion to refuse to call an election for the adoption of an ordinance which it found to be invalid and that mandamus was not the proper remedy to compel the calling of the election. Moreover, the court held that the people did not have the power to call for an election for the increase of taxation because that was a legislative function.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city began making repairs to the property owner's building under the authority of New Orleans, La., Code of the City of New Orleans &sect; 30-12(2), which provided that the city could repair buildings that violated minimum housing standards and collect the repair costs through a tax lien. The trial court's written findings declared that by permitting the city to repair the property without the property owner's consent, the ordinance violated the property owner's rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV by depriving him of property without due process of law. The court transferred the city's appeal to the Louisiana Supreme Court and held that where a judgment enjoined action under an ordinance for the written reasons that the action authorized by the ordinance was unconstitutional, the case was one in which the ordinance had been declared unconstitutional within the meaning of La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 10, para. 4(2), and the appeal lay before the Supreme Court rather than a Court of Appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school board challenged a judgment by a trial court (Louisiana), which maintained appellee surety's exception of a three-year prescription, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38:2189, for a suit against a surety on a public contract. The trial court dismissed the suit, which had been filed against the surety and defendants, a contractor and subcontractors, after structural cracks were found in a school building.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A construction company entered into a contract with the school board for the purpose of constructing a school building. The surety, an insurance company, was the surety on the contract. The building was completed and accepted by the school board. Approximately eight years after acceptance of the building, cracks were noticed in some structural members, and suit was filed within one year after the cracks were first discovered. The surety filed an exception of the three year prescriptive period founded in &sect; 38:2189 for an action against a surety on a public contract. The exception was maintained, and the suit was dismissed. Affirming, the court held that the building of a public school by a school board clearly fell within the Public Works Act, and the contract had to comply with the Act's provisions. Further, the three year prescriptive period provided in &sect; 38:2189 was required to be read into the bond and had to be applied. Moreover, a statute that set out a prescriptive period was remedial legislation and was to be applied retrospectively unless other specifically provided. Thus, the claim against the surety was filed four years too late and was therefore prescribed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reexamined and affirmed its original opinion, holding that the district attorneys were not entitled to pay increases provided for in a general appropriations act. The court found that the state constitution required a two-thirds vote to grant a public officer a salary increase and only a majority vote to implement such increases in pursuance of the constitutional mandate, which required a specific appropriation made by law. Therefore, the two-thirds vote of the legislature to grant the pay raise was merely a compliance with a constitutional provision rather than an expression of a contrary intent specifically nullifying the provisions of the General Appropriation Act. It was determined that appropriation was made for the payment of their salaries on the district attorney's own warrant in compliance with the law then in effect. By providing the manner in which salaries were to be paid, the legislature did not hamper or render impotent the operations of a coordinate branch of the government by legislative failure or refusal to appropriate funds for their operation pursuant to constitutional authorization.</SPAN></P>

In reversing in part, the court held that those portions of Act 216 that provided for filling the newly created judgeships by appointment were unconstitutional. A new district judgeship was not an office created by the Legislature and it was without authority to provide for the mode of filling a constitutional office in contravention of a specific constitutional provision. However, La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 33 expressly provided for the election of judges to newly created district judgeships. The provisions of art. VII, &sect; 33 as amended by Act 754 of 1954, which dealt specifically with the filling of the office of a newly created district judge, was not to yield to the general language contained in La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer brought a class action, seeking to enjoin the State Bond and Building Commission from issuing certain bonds and the State Market Commission from receiving the proceeds to make a loan to the company. The taxpayer claimed that the 1969 La. Acts 172 (Act) was unconstitutional. The district court sustained the company and commissions' exceptions and dismissed the action. On appeal, the court reversed and set aside the judgment dismissing the class action and remanded for further proceedings. The court ruled that the proceeds of the bond were not to be used by any state board or agency to make capital improvements. Since the funds were to be used by the State Market Commission to make a loan, the Act was unconstitutional because it violated La. Const. art. 4, &sect; 2 and did not fall within any of the exceptions under &sect; 2. The court held that the right to appropriate funds did not include the right to borrow money, through bond issues to make the funds available.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An adoption agency located in a garden district sought a variance form the board of the city in order to renovate a maternity residence. The board granted the variance and the garden district filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to have the action of the board vacated. The maternity home intervened in the suit almost two months after the variance was granted. The trial court found in favor of the city and the district sought review. The court affirmed. The court dismissed the district's exceptions to the intervention; a local ordinance requiring intervention to be filed within a 30-day period applied only to those who, through judicial review, sought some relief not given to them by a board decision. Nor did the court find that the board was without authority to grant the variance. The agency showed sufficient hardship and difficulties to empower the board to grant an otherwise proper variance to permit structural alteration of a building already devoted to a legal, non-conforming use. The action of the board in allowing an enlargement of a nonconforming use of realty to one property owner was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The trial court found that his suit for benefits had perempted under the Workmen's Compensation Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1209. On appeal, the employee argued that erroneous advice from the employer's physicians suspended the period of limitation and that prescription of an action before it could be brought violated La. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 2 and 6. In affirming, the court ruled that because the injury developed at a later than the accident, it was exactly the type of injury the amended La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1209 contemplated and it was included in the statutory wording, which stated that the claim was forever barred unless the proceedings were instituted within two years from the date of the accident. The court held that, more than two years having elapsed between the date of the accident and the time when suit was filed, plaintiff's claim was barred. The court also held that the suit was a creature of the Act and subject to the limitations thereof, which were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the husband was injured, the wife left the home and filed for a divorce. The husband countersued and was granted a divorce and custody of their minor children. Four days after the judgment of divorce, the husband settled his claim for personal injuries. In compliance with an order of the trial court, the settlement was entered into jointly between the parties as claimants. The trial court found that the settlement money was community property and awarded one-half to the wife, minus certain expenses. The court reversed and remanded for further proceedings, finding that the wife was entitled to share in the damages to the extent that they accrued during the community regime. The court held that the wife was not entitled to participate in that portion of the settlement that compensated the husband for damages accruing after the dissolution of the community regime, including future disability, medical expenses, and future loss of earnings. The court remanded for the taking of testimony relative to the nature of the injuries sustained by the husband so as to determine the basis for the settlement and to allocate amounts to such items as may have been included in the settlement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Louisiana Wild Life and Fisheries Commission seized alligator skins as evidence in connection with criminal charges filed against the owners of the skins. Two years after the charges were nol-prossed, the owners filed a petition for a writ of mandamus ordering the return of the skins. The trial made peremptory an alternative writ directing the Commission to return the skins. On appeal, the court held that because no further charges were brought against the owners within the two-year period, criminal prosecution against them was forever barred. The Commission was authorized by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:260(B) to seize the skins at the investigation stage and to hold them as evidence to be used in a criminal proceeding against the owners. However, once the criminal prosecution was barred by prescription, the Commission had no authority to retain the material seized. Because the criminal proceeding gave the owners a hearing to determine the validity of confiscation, &sect; 56:260 was constitutional. Because &sect; 56:260 absolved the Commission of all liability for the seizure, the owners were entitled to mandamus under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 3862.</SPAN></P>

The trial court issued a temporary injunction to prohibit defendant from the practice of medicine until he was properly licensed. The court affirmed. Three witnesses had testified that they had received treated from defendant at a chiropractic clinic; the treatment involved the use of various machines, an examination, a diagnosis, and an adjustment. Defendant's stationery and business cards identified him as a doctor. The evidence was thus sufficient to support the conclusion that defendant was holding himself out to the public as a doctor of chiropractic. The practice of chiropractic could not be engaged in without a medical license, which defendant had failed to obtain. The trial court did not err in failing to sustain the plea to transfer the case to a criminal court; the preliminary injunction signed by the trial court did not impose a monetary penalty. The medical practice act did not violate the due process or equal protection clauses of the federal or state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the landowner purchased his property, it was zoned to permit the construction of a mobile home park. After the landowner applied for a permit authorizing construction of a mobile home park, the city-parish council directed the building official not to issue any permits for mobile home parks pending further instruction of the council. The landowner then obtained a writ of mandamus compelling issuance of the permit, after which the council adopted an ordinance, which had the effect of forbidding issuance of a mobile home park permit unless a special district was created by an amendment of the zoning ordinance. The ordinance contained no guidelines or criteria to be followed by the council in the creation of a special district, and it vested in the council the authority to grant or withhold permits at will and to discriminate in favor of or against applicants for permits. The trial court granted a new trial and dismissed the landowner's suit. The court reversed. The ordinance was unconstitutional because it did not set forth guidelines sufficient to ensure that all those similarly situated would be treated alike, and the landowner was entitled to a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property taxpayers sought review of a judgment from the trial court (Louisiana), which denied their request for a writ of mandamus to compel appellees, the Louisiana Tax Commission (commission) and its members, to determine the actual cash value of all taxable property in Louisiana for ad valorem tax purposes, and to fix the percentage of the actual cash value upon which ad valorem taxes must be assessed and collected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property taxpayers contended that the commission's failure to assess property at its actual cash value and instead permitting the parish tax assessors to assess property in their respective parishes at various arbitrarily fixed amounts having no real, consistent, or reasonable relationship to actual value constituted unreasonable discrimination and violated equal protection. The property taxpayers contended that the commission was required to act under La. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2 and 6. The trial court denied the property taxpayers' request because they had not exhausted the administrative remedies set forth in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1998(2). The court affirmed that judgment. The court held that the property taxpayers' goal was dependent on the property taxpayers being able to establish that their own assessments were incorrect and illegal. The court stated that in order to secure a judicial review of their own assessment, the property taxpayers must comply with the conditions of &sect; 47:1998.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants used the batture, which was zoned as single family residential, for mooring barges waiting to be taken to a point where they could be loaded or unloaded or repaired. Plaintiffs sought to enjoin that use of the batture as being in violation of the zoning ordinance. The trial court dismissed the suit and plaintiffs appealed. The court found no error in the dismissal of the entire suit after trial of a rule for preliminary injunction because the hearing dealt with all the meritorious issues and the trial judge maintained the defendants' peremptory exception of no right of action, and did not merely deny the preliminary injunction. The court concluded that the zoning ordinance was contrary to the law because the riparian owner owned the batture subject to the servitude of public use; therefore, the restriction of its use by the ordinance was unlawful. The court found that using the batture for tying up barges was a logical use for the public and the batture's lessor. The trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court examined the constitutional development and enabling clauses therein. The court noted that public servants where entitled to receive fair remuneration and compensation. The court held that any legislative expression regarding payment of salaries or expenses of members of the legislature and other constitutional officers was to be liberally construed in favor of validity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant filed suit against the school board, each member, and the superintendent, attacking the validity of a special bond and tax election as authorized by La.

She sought to have the election declared null and void because it deprived the claimant and other non-property owner voters of their rights under the equal protection and due process clauses of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The school board filed a peremptory exception of prescription on the grounds that the 60 day prescriptive period in La. Const. art. 14, &sect; 14(n) and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:518 had expired. The trial court maintained the exception of prescription and dismissed the claimant's suit. She appealed, and the court held that the claimant and other of her class were deprived of the elective franchise solely because of their failure to own any real or personal property subject to taxation. Thus, the decision of the trial court was correct in that the plea of prescription and preemption of 60 days was absolute.</SPAN></P>

After a trial, judgment was rendered making the writ of mandamus peremptory and ordering the commission to approve the tax roll.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The assessor reduced property taxes for the 1969 tax year below their level for 1968. The commission ordered him to increase all such reduced assessments to their 1968 levels. The assessor filed the tax roll without the commission's approval as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1993. The taxpayer urged, inter alia, that the commission arbitrarily refused to accept such property tax roll and that the time had passed by which it could lawfully change or correct the assessments. In reversing the judgment, the court found, inter alia, that it had jurisdiction over the matter, as it did not involve the constitutionality or legality of a tax, but rather the validity of the assessments. The court opined that a writ a mandamus issued in error, as the commission's duties to fix the value of all taxable property in the state for tax purposes, under the authority of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 47:1957, 47:1989, 47:1990, were discretionary, and not ministerial, and subject only to the constitutional and statutory limitations dealing with assessment procedure.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer filed a class action to enjoin the State Market Commission from making and the grain drier from receiving a loan from the proceeds of bonds to be issued by the State Bond and Building Commission pursuant to 1969 La. Acts 172, &sect; 1. The taxpayer alleged that the statute violated La. Const. art. 4, &sect; 12(b). Noting that an adjudication in favor of the taxpayer would necessarily constitute an adjudication that the State Bond and Building Commission, the agency authorized to issue the bonds, could not issue the bonds, and that agency was an indispensable party to the suit under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 641 because its interests were so directly affected by the subject matter of the suit that a complete and equitable adjudication of the controversy could not be made unless it was joined in the action. The court set aside the taxpayer's appeal from judgment dismissing the suit. Exercising discretion pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were arrested and threatened with prosecution for trespass. Plaintiffs argued that their prosecution would result in irreparable harm by their loss of their alleged right to use the lands involved, or by wrongful prosecution. The subject lands included a levee and land between the levee and a river that were owned by private individuals or corporations. The court affirmed the denial of plaintiffs' request to enjoin their prosecution because plaintiffs had no property rights in the lands. The riparian servitudes existed only for that which was incident to the nature and the navigable character of the stream washing the land of the proprietor. Plaintiffs' right to hunt and fish on the land was unrelated to the nature and navigable character of the water. Furthermore, if the roads and levees were private, plaintiffs could not use them; if they were public, the law prohibited hunting on them. La. Rev. Stat. 32:292. Private or public, hunting from levees was specifically prohibited by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38:213.1 The court could not render a declaratory judgment pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc.

Any liability on the forged checks could not be enforced against defendant bank because plaintiff failed to detect and notify defendant bank of the forgeries upon return of the cancelled checks each month. Defendant bank was also not liable on the genuine checks with forged endorsements, because they were bearer paper under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7:9(3). Plaintiff's claim against defendant underwriter failed because the bond insured defendant bank --not third parties--against losses.

The same relief was also sought for the alleged wrongful use by the abutting landowner of another tract of land, the sole use of which had been vested in the landowners' by a city. The landowners accused the abutting landowner of using the tract for commercial purposes by having erected advertising thereon. It was alleged that the abutting landowner was wrongfully using the other tract by the launching of boats of patrons from that tract. The trial court rejected the landowners' prayer for injunctive relief based on La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5625.

The court noted that one of the pipeline's experts at trial should have been disallowed due to the nature of his testimony. However, the court held that the pipeline did not act in bad faith and was not arbitrary or capricious. The court found that one of the pipeline's experts had done a thorough and fair evaluation of the land values and used that appraisal in the decision to amend the award.

Defendants could rely on a well-established rule which clothed them with immunity from the claim. La. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed the judgment of the lower court (Louisiana), which denied plaintiff's petition for a declaratory judgment classifying three items as premiums subject to annual license taxes under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 22:1061, :1066.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a former employee of the state insurance department, sought a declaratory judgment classifying three forms of contributions or payments as premiums under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 22:1061, :1066, which was denied. On appeal, the court applied various rules of statutory construction. The court first determined that dividends applied to paid up insurance did not change the amount of the premium due and to be paid to the insurer and, therefore, did not constitute premiums under the statutes. Next, the court held that payments on group policies issued by an employer-insurer to its own employees were not taxable as premiums. There was no purchase of insurance because the contract was founded on the employer-employee relationship, not on a purchaser-seller basis. Furthermore, the exemption did not discriminate against the insurer who had to pay the tax for a group policy issued to a third party employer-insurer for its employees. Finally, the court held the statute only taxed premiums paid and, since premiums waived under disability or other contract provisions were not paid, they were not taxable. Thus, the lower court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because dividends used for paid up insurance did not change amount of premium due to insurer, payments on group policies issued by an employer-insurer to its own employees was not a purchases of insurance, and premiums waived under disability or other contract provisions were not paid.</SPAN></P>

The tax collector sought to impose the privilege tax of La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 47:601 upon the company for the partial year in which it was constructing its facility. The company argued that imposition of the privilege tax violated the Commerce Clause of U.S. Cons. art. I, &sect; 8 because the company was engaged in interstate business. The tax collector argued that during the tax year in question, all of the company's activities consisted of local construction and it was not engaged in interstate commerce until its pipeline was connected and started pumping oil. The trial court ordered the tax collector to refund taxes collected from the company. The court held that only the construction contractor hired by the company was engaged in solely local business, and that the company's construction was related only to its sole enterprise of operating an interstate pipeline. The court held that the company's activities for the tax year in question were in furtherance of interstate commerce, and imposition of the tax violated the Commerce Clause.

Interested citizens, property owners, taxpayers, and residents intervened and joined the police jury in resisting plaintiff's demands.

Opposition to the demand was based upon the proposition that the sale of liquors at the location came within a statutory prohibition of the sale of intoxicating liquors within five miles of the local high school. Upon reviewing the case, the court rejected plaintiff's demands. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional in that it purported to regulate the moral climate of the area in and around the school. The court also held that the statute did not deprive plaintiff of due process of law in connection with his endeavors to engage in a legitimate business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the contractor argued that action of the police jury and the state department contravened La. Rev.

The state department argued that it was not subject to injunction because a special statute applicable to the state department permitted it to construct roadways with its own maintenance personnel without advertising the work for bids. The police jury argued that &sect; 38:2211 was unconstitutional in that the title of the act was not sufficiently descriptive of the scope and extent of the statute. The court, reversing the judgment of the trial court, stated that the trial court erred in declining to issue the injunction. The court stated the amendment to the statute merely changing the previously established advertisement time could not be interpreted as introducing new subject matter, was not misleading, the it was clear that the statute require mandatory advertising for bids on all public works exceeding $ 2,500. The court stated that the state department could not utilize its avowed lawful prerogatives to achieve performance of work for another agency.</SPAN></P>

The applicant contended that the zoning ordinance was in violation of the enabling act, 1954 La. Acts 518, which required zoning to be carried out in accordance with a comprehensive plan. The applicant also claimed that the ordinance was unconstitutionally arbitrary and discriminatory. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, finding that the requirements of a comprehensive plan were met where regulations were designed to lessen congestion in the public streets, to secure safety from fire, to promote health and the general welfare, and to avoid undue concentration of population. Additionally, the court found that the ordinance in question merely attempted to protect an established residential area. Because the ordinance applied alike to all persons similarly situated, it could not be said to violate the due process and equal protection clauses of the constitution.

The petition also challenged the constitutionality of a statute that imposed criminal penalties on city officials who permitted violations of the firemen's minimum pay statutes. On appeal, the court held that it had jurisdiction to hear the suit and allowed the intervention of a fire fighter's association. The court overruled the city's plea of sovereign immunity. The court upheld the constitutionality of the firemen's minimum wage statutes, finding they did not violate the home rule provision of La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 40(d), nor did they conflict with the constitutional authority granted to municipal fire civil service boards. The court held that the criminal penalty statute was unconstitutional because it was vague and indefinite, did not plainly and adequately set out a crime, and was not susceptible to a reasonable interpretation as to what acts were prohibited. The court remanded for issuance of an injunction prohibiting criminal prosecution of city officials under the criminal statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The main issue in the case was whether the public utility corporation, the holder and user of a right of way across the land owner's property, could have acquired by expropriation a new right of way at a new location across the same tract of land and offset the value of the new right of way by the extinguishment of the existing right of way. The district court rendered judgment in favor of the utility, which the land owner appealed. When the utility abandoned and released the existing right of way it gave nothing of value to the land owner. To permit the utility to setoff any advantage of the remaining land resulting from the cancellation and abandonment of the old right of way against the value of the new right of way would have been contrary to the positive provisions of Louisiana law. Just compensation for the new right of way must have been paid in money and should have been paid before the utility took possession. While the utility had possession of both rights of way, the utility should have paid for the continued use of the old right of way from the date of that judgment until the release of that right of way became effective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and recast.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant landowners appealed from the judgment of the District Court (Louisiana) granting plaintiff electric utility company a new right of way across a different portion of the landowners' properties. The utility company brought the three expropriation suits, which were consolidated for trial, pursuant its authority under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;19:2(9). The utility company also appealed from the denial of credit for the abandoned servitude.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility company owned an existing servitude across the landowners' property on which it had electric transmission lines. It brought the suits to obtain a servitude across a different portion of the landowners' properties, which allegedly was necessary to relocate and reconstitute a segment of its lines. The landowners urged, inter alia, that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:14 was unconstitutional as applied. The company also appealed seeking a credit for the abandoned servitudes. The district court had entered judgments for the utility company. The court amended the judgments by increasing the landowners' awards, and affirmed the judgments as amended. The court found, inter alia, that the landowners were not denied due process, and opined that they had failed to show any instances where the time elements under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 19:5, 19:6, 19:7, or the absence of the usual procedural devices and delays, had in fact deprived them of their ability to present a proper defense. Nor was the company entitled to a credit for its abandoned servitudes, as the company never acquired anything more than the right of use of the servitudes under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 658.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court increased the trial court awards as to each of the landowners for the servitudes over their properties granted to the electric utility company, and, as amended, the court affirmed the judgments in favor of the electric company in its expropriation suits.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the levee board had the right to require the landowners to remove their fences as obstacles to maintenance of the levee. Further, the court was unable to find unreasonable the regulation that a landowner, desiring to secure a fence permit either to continue maintenance of or to build a fence, may be permitted to receive one only if he installs a cattle guard of suitable specifications or else pays the levee board $ 100 for it to install such a cattle guard at or below cost.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board filed this petition and a rule for mandamus against the city, seeking to compel the city to appropriate the funds in order to pay a two percent cost of living increase in pension benefits to retired firemen in conformity with the provisions of an amendment to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2117. The city contended that the legislature intended that the two percent increase was not to become effective until January 1, 1968, and they asserted that the phrase &quot;shall annually appropriate&quot; did not cover a semiannual period. The court found that the statute did not designate a particular date on which the act was to become effective, and the general rule was that an act of the legislature became effective 20 days after the adjournment of the legislature where no special date for its effectiveness was expressed. The statute, which formed the subject matter of this tedious litigation, was a mandatory law. The city was required as a ministerial function to make the appropriation, and it was for this reason that mandamus was the proper procedure for the enforcement of this obligation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the police and the sheriff and the seller appealed, alleging that Act 458 of 1962 was unconstitutional as a violation of La. Const. art. IV, &sect; 4. The court reversed, holding that Act 458 of 1962 was unconstitutional for the reason that it violated the prohibitive provisions of La. Const. art. IV, &sect; 4, which provided that the legislature could not pass any local or special law on the holding of elections. Act 458 was both a local and a special law restricted in its application to the unincorporated portions of the ward in question and to no other area of any other ward or any other parish of Louisiana; therefore, it was inapplicable to the sellers, and the police and the sheriff were enjoined from refusing to issue permits to the sellers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The land at issue, uninhabited woodland in a swamp area and unaccessible by any improved road, was an irregular section containing 128.5 acres, 4.16 acres of which were in the production unit from which the royalties were being paid. None of the private claimants had ever had any possession whatsoever of the land, none of them were aware of its existence prior to their execution of leases in the fall of 1966 when contacted by the representatives of the oil company, nor were they aware of any possession by their ancestors. The court held that the school board had not acquired title by prescription, because it did not show that it commenced a 30-year period of possession, for purposes of acquisitive prescription, by the corporeal possession required by La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 3501. The court stated that there simply was no legal basis on which the school board had title to the property, so long as the patent was not annulled through court proceedings instituted for that purpose. In the present proceedings, the court had no alternative but to hold that the private claimants had proved their title to the property, based on a tax sale.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial court's judgment and rendered judgment in favor of the funeral home. The exclusions contained in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:846A(2) gave a preference to those licensed funeral directors who had contracts with burial insurance companies naming them as the official establishments. Thus, the statute affected one segment of a class of persons differently from the remainder of the class. Under the police power the legislature could prescribe various rules to regulate the business of funeral directing and embalming; however, the rules adopted had to relate to public health, welfare, or morals. The court could find no benefit to health or welfare of the public by prohibiting such advertisement. Furthermore, any truthful or misleading statements either in advertising or sale of merchandise violated La. Rev. Stat.

The court held that the requirement of security for costs was not an unreasonable one and was prohibited by neither the letter nor spirit of La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 6. The court ruled that the constitutional declaration that the courts were to be open, and every person for injury done him in his rights, lands, goods, person, or reputation had to have adequate remedy by due process of law, etc. was not to be understood or construed as taking from the legislature the power to prescribe reasonable rules and regulations relative to the costs incurred in litigation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowner received a building permit from the city and began building an expensive home on a lot between the neighbors' lots. Though the setbacks of the neighbors' houses from the street were over 38 feet, the homeowner situated his house 25 feet from the property line. The driveway and pool house were built within a few inches of the neighbors' properties. The neighbors sought to enjoin the construction on the ground that it violated setback ordinances. The trial court found in favor of the neighbors and enjoined the homeowner from constructing anything that violated the ordinances and it ordered the city to revoke the building permit. The city and the homeowner appealed. The court required the homeowner to place his residence as far back from the front property line as the closest adjacent home, 38 feet. The court also enforced the zoning ordinances affecting the driveway and pool house setbacks. The court concluded that the zoning ordinances were legal and valid, and in no way constitutionally vague. The court found that the trial court was also correct in ordering the city to rescind the building permit and to cause the removal of the building infractions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union argued that the trial court had no jurisdiction to issue a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction because the breach of contract sought to be enjoined constituted an unfair labor practice over which the National Labor Relations Board had exclusive jurisdiction. The union also contended that the trial court was bound to apply federal labor law, which law deprived state courts of the power to issue any restraining order or injunction. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that state courts possessed jurisdiction concurrent with that of federal courts in suits to enforce labor contracts. Further, the court found that Congress refused to make all breaches of labor contracts unfair labor practices when it passed &sect; 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 185. Finally, the court rejected the union's contention that the &quot;Little Norris-LaGuardia Act,&quot; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:841 et seq., prevented state court's from issuing injunctions in labor disputes, finding that whenever there was a property right involved, an injunction would lie to prevent injury to that property right, notwithstanding the provisions of &sect; 23:841 et seq.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The seller brought a declaratory action and alleged that the contract between the seller and buyer should be avoided because there was no agreement as to the price to be paid for the gas.

Further, the court held that the basic purchase price of the gas was a net price to the seller and it was not contemplated, nor could it be inferred from the contract that the seller would in any event be required to absorb additional tax that would result in a reduction of the net basic price of the gas. The court held that the contract obligated the buyer to reimburse the seller for certain taxes on the gas sold to the buyer on the proportional basis prescribed in the contract and the basic price together with the reimbursement of taxes constituted a firm, fixed and definite price for the gas and there was no cause for an avoidance of the contract for the lack of an agreement as to the price.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court awarded back pay to appellees based on the court's previous decree ordering their reinstatement with wages due from October 29, 1954 to March 1, 1965.

Civ. Serv. R. 13.18(b) and the duration thereof deducted from the period during which appellees could be awarded back pay. On appeal, the court found that the trial court had erred in declining to allow credit or offset for the commissions paid to one of the appellees, who worked as a real estate agent, because such commissions were wages and salaries within the meaning of the terms included in La.

The trial court was also found to have erred in awarding interest on all claims from October 29, 1954, to the date of reinstatement because the general laws relative to payment of interest was not applicable to the state.

Following a trial, the district court entered a judgment in favor of the taxpayer, and the school board appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that the ordinance imposed a use tax only for purchases made after January 1, 1966, outside the parish by those seeking to avoid the sales tax and to avoid having the parish miss revenues that it would otherwise have received. The use tax was complementary to and an adjunct of the sales tax but was not designed to nor did it have the effect of bringing revenue into the parish that the parish would not have received if the equipment had been purchased in the parish. The equipment at issue was purchased in January of 1965, almost a full year before the effective date of the ordinance.

Ann. art. 1872 and that the helmet ordinance constituted a denial of due process of law to the plaintiffs because it deprived them of an individual liberty without promoting a purpose beneficial to the public at large. Further, plaintiffs were denied the equal protection of laws because the ordinance imposed undue restrictions upon one class of the motoring public without any salutary effect to the public at large.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed in part because no injunctive relief was available in the civil courts to enjoin the enforcement of a penal ordinance. The judgment was reversed in part, however, and the ordinance was deemed unconstitutional as a violation of the due process and equal protection rights of the motorcycle riders.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner failed pursuant to La. Rev. Stat.

The landowner contended that by virtue of La. Const. art. 3, &sect; 35, the legislature could by joint resolution waive the prescription and allow his suit. Based on the landowner's senate concurrent resolution, the trial court dismissed the department's petition for final judgment. The court granted certiorari and reversed the judgment of the trial court, finding that art. 3, &sect; 35 dealt only with those matters in which the state enjoyed sovereign immunity. The court found that under La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2 and La. Const. art. 6, &sect;&sect; 19, 19.1, the state enjoyed immunity from neither suit nor liability when property was taken. The court held that under La. Const. art. 4, &sect; 4, the state could not by special legislation grant one man any special or exclusive right, privilege, or immunity. Therefore, the landowner's failure to conform to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:450 was a waiver or abandonment or relinquishment of that cause of action he enjoyed previously.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled the wife's exception and granted a separation. The wife appealed.

The husband argued that the residency requirement statute in Arkansas was unconstitutional.

By its answer to the appeal, the Board challenged the trial court action overruling one of the Board's findings, and the trial court's authority to review the penalty imposed by the Board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court affirmed the Board's decision convicting the optometrist of violating LA. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:1061 in a number of respects, but twice reversed the penalty imposed by the Board, the Board held a third hearing and suspended the optometrist's license to practice optometry for six months. Although courts did not substitute their judgments for the judgments of administrative or executive boards or persons in authority in the absence of a showing of a grave mistake of fact or law, discrimination, arbitrariness, or a manifest abuse of discretion, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:1062, because an appeal to the court brought the entire matter before it, the penalty as well as the offense itself. If the penalty imposed was one so harsh as to point up an abuse of discretion, the court could treat with that as well as with any other phase of the matter. However, the court affirmed the trial court judgment because there was no evidence that the optometrist was offered any temptation or solicited to do something that he knew he should not do, and the final penalty imposed was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town filed a declaratory judgment action seeking an order holding that an alley was a public throughway and to have obstructions placed there by the property owner removed. The town contended that the alley had become public by virtue of either implied or tacit dedication by the property owner. The trial court held for the town, and the property owner appealed. The court held that although testimony showed that the town employees periodically maintained the passageway, the evidence was insufficient to show either a definite offer or acceptance. This alley was not opened with the intent to serve any of the public, but for the purpose of providing a convenient egress and ingress for the property owners' tenants. The court found nothing to estop the property owner from asserting ownership of the alley. Thus, the property owner had not impliedly dedicated the alley for public use. She had protested to the town attorney about the town's action in placing gravel on the alley. The court concluded that this timely action on the property owner's part precluded the town from claiming the alley as public property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed, and the court ordered that the alley was the private property of the property owner.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs alleged that the garbage truck caused an auto accident in which plaintiffs were injured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured parties were in a car that collided with a city garbage truck when it suddenly stopped in front of them. The injured parties sued the city, as well as other defendants. The city filed a motion to dismiss, contending that there was no cause of action because the collection and disposal of garbage and trash was a governmental function for which, in the absence of specific legislative authorization, no liability attached. The trial judge agreed. On review, the court noted that there was some understandable confusion regarding the state of the law on governmental immunity. However, the court held that the trial judge erred in failing to hold that the city's charter which permitted it to be sued, when construed with La. Const. art. III, &sect; 35, constituted a waiver of immunity from both suit and liability on behalf of the city for the negligent acts of its employees. This waiver of suit and liability applied irrespective of whether the negligent acts of the governmental employee were deemed to be proprietary or governmental. Accordingly, the court held the lower court judgment was improper.</SPAN></P>

She untruthfully stated her plans had been altered when in fact she carried out her intentions to marry, in willful breach of her written agreement with the employer.

The court upheld the trial court's judgment. First, the court held that pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1581, the plea of prescription was inapplicable with respect to tax assessments.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff electric corporation sought review from the Fifteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Vermilion (Louisiana), which held that the corporation had the right to expropriate defendant landowners' properties without the need of a certificate of public convenience and necessity. The corporation perfected a devolutive appeal requesting the judgment to be reversed concerning severance damage awards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation desired to construct a high-powered transmission line and expropriated servitudes, or rights-of-way, across the private property of the landowners. The matter proceeded to trial, where the court awarded the landowners severance damage and an award for expert fees. From this part of the decision, the corporation sought review. On appeal, the court found that the corporation was associated with the public interest to the degree that the law did give it the right of eminent domain and it had established the necessity and the desirability in the public interest to construct the proposed transmission line. However, the court determined that the corporation's on-site route was arbitrarily in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:2(9). Therefore, the judgment was reversed and the case remanded for the purpose of receiving further evidence on the restricted point pertaining to the relocation of the line across the property of the landowners and for review of the issue of severance damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment in favor of the landowners and against the corporation concerning severance damage awards was reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial court's decision because the sections were in conformity with the legislative provisions relating to the power structure of the municipal government. Furthermore, the additional duties prescribed by the two sections were within defendants' power to affix by ordinance. Contrary to the trial court's holding, the ordinance did not completely remove all personnel and equipment from the control and jurisdiction of the marshal. The language of La. Rev. Stat.

The court held that under the industrial inducement law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 991, the city acted within its authority when it provided inducements to the industries, because its issuance of the revenue bonds did not constitute a loan of public credit for a private purpose. The court also determined that the city's leases did not constitute a pledge or general credit. Finally, the court concluded that the revenue bonds were properly excluded from computing the city's indebtedness, and therefore did not fall under any constitutional or statutory limitation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This was an expropriation proceeding brought by a natural gas company in order to lay a pipeline across the landowner's property. The trial court granted judgment in favor of the natural gas company and fixed compensation. On review, the landowner contended that the certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the Federal Power Commission, upon which the natural gas company relied for its authority to construct the pipeline, was invalid. The court dismissed this argument because it held that any complaint the landowner might have regarding the conditions upon which the authority was granted would have to be addressed to the Federal Power Commission, and that the court would not entertain any collateral attack on the validity of the certificate. The court also held that the natural gas company could not contract away its power of expropriation. While it had executed an earlier contract with the same landowner regarding another pipeline, its right to take, according to law and for a just compensation, additional land for the construction of a new pipeline was not affected by the earlier contract.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supermarket chain sought to enjoin the milk commission from enforcing the price-fixing provisions on frozen desserts. The commission argued that the supermarket chain was involved in illegal sales and sold ice milk for less than the minimum established wholesale price or the invoice price. The evidence indicated that the supermarket purchased frozen desserts from outside of Louisiana and transported by means of common carrier. The supermarket argued that the commission lacked authority to regulate the wholesale prices of frozen desserts by a processor in another state of products shipped into Louisiana in interstate commerce and that the interstate commerce clause precluded economic regulation by the commission of interstate transactions involving frozen desserts and milk products. The court, affirming the district court's decision, stated that all legislation was presumed to be constitutional and the supermarket chain, attaching the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:940.19(5), failed to sustain its burden. The court stated that merely fixing the price below which producers could not sell did not mean the statute was arbitrary and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff retired police officers appealed from the Ninth Judicial District Court (Louisiana), dismissing their action in mandamus against defendants, city council, the city's mayor, and other city representatives, to compel payment into the city's police pension fund. After a hearing on the merits, an exception to the police officer's lack of procedural capacity was sustained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retired police officers claimed that the city had failed for eight years prior to the suit to appropriate money and pay into the police pension fund as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2222. The city urged that it was not required to do so until the fund declined to a set amount. The fund had substantially declined. The district court had dismissed the suit. The court reversed the judgment and directed the judge below to order the city council to pay a certain sum into the fund. The court found that the officers' right to pension proceeds had vested, as they were retired and thus, they possessed a real and actual interest pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 681 which could be asserted in a mandamus suit. Nor was the Board of Trustees of the pension fund an indispensable party to the suit under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 641. On the merits, the court found that, by the plain meaning of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2222, its language was mandatory and explicitly placed a positive duty upon the city to appropriate and pay at the end of each fiscal year the difference between the benefits paid out in that year and the intake of fines and licensing revenues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff lessee sued defendant lessor to recover the fair market value of certain improvements and equipment the lessor agreed to purchase should the lessee terminate the lease of a segregated amusement park should segregation become impossible. The trial court (Louisiana) found in favor of the lessee and awarded damages. The lessor sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This litigation arose as the result of a lease to operate an amusement park solely for African Americans. After the lease was executed, it became apparent that segregation of public property might be held to be illegal by the courts. Consequently, the lessor and lessee amended the lease to create a termination option if segregation became impossible. After federal civil rights legislation was passed, the lessee decided to avail itself of the option and gave notice of cancellation. When the lessor failed to purchase certain equipment as promised, the lessee filed suit. The trial court found in favor of the lessee and the lessor appealed. On review, the lessor contended that the lease amendment was void due to lack of consideration and a potestative condition. The court rejected these arguments because it found that a percentage to the lessor of the lessee's receipts from the operation of the amusement park was valid consideration for the lease. The court also found that there was no potestative condition because the lessee had no control over whether segregation would be ruled illegal. Accordingly, the judgment in favor of the lessee was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that granted lessee cancellation of its lease of a segregated amusement park and ordered the lessor to pay for certain equipment and improvements. The judgment was also amended to clarify that, after the lessor made such payments, the property would be designated as the property of the lessor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a decision which granted a state medical board's exception of lis pendens and dismissed a physician's action seeking reinstatement of his license to practice medicine, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the exception of lis pendens was not valid and should have been overruled. La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 531 implicitly stated that to successfully support a plea of lis pendens there must be: (1) the same causes of action; (2) the same parties; (3) in the same capacity; and (4) the same objects. Here there were two suits, one an ordinary proceeding brought by the board against the physician seeking an injunction to prohibit the physician from practicing medicine without a license, and the other a summary proceeding brought the physician against the board for a license to practice. The court held that two of the indispensable requirements of lis pendens were notably absent, i.e., the identity of the causes of action and the same objects. Further, a fair test of lis pendens was to inquire whether a final judgment in the former suit would be res judicata in the latter. Here, the judgment in the one case could not be res judicata as to the other case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The funeral home placed an advertisement in a newspaper which stated that the funeral home would credit the face value of any valid burial policy on the bill for services it performed. The board prohibited the advertisement because it violated its rules and regulations. The funeral home contended the board exceeded the authority conferred on it when it adopted the rules in question and the prohibition was violative of the funeral homes' free speech rights. The trial court held the board's rules and regulations were promulgated under valid statutory authority and were not violative of any constitutional provision. Before trial, the provisions of the statute, which the funeral home argued was void and the board based its defense, was amended. Then, after trial, the statute was amended again. The court stated the rules and regulations which the funeral home complained about had been repealed and no longer existed. The court noted that no direct attack was made on the constitutionality of the amending statutes, and therefore it could not consider the issue. In the interest of justice and to avoid additional delays, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the cause.</SPAN></P>

The trial court maintained exceptions of no right or cause of action. The administratrix appealed, contending that the denial of that right to illegitimate children solely because of their status was, as to them, a denial of due process and equal protection under law under both La. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, and U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV, and because it bore no real or substantial relation to the general health, morals, or welfare of the people. The court held that &quot;child&quot; meant legitimate child, and recovery was denied both to illegitimate and putative children for the wrongful death of a parent. Therefore, since there was no discrimination in the denial of the right of illegitimate children to recover based on race, color, or creed, there was no basis for the contention of unconstitutionality.

In addition, jurisdiction was proper under La. Code Civ. Proc.

IV, &sect; 12, which prohibited the lending or use of the credit or property of the state or any of its political corporations to any person, association, or corporation, public or private. The trial court dismissed the lawsuit and the taxpayers appealed the ruling. The court held that state law authorizing the parish to acquire, lease and dispose of property for purposes of industrial development, or its proposed plan was not unconstitutional as violations of due process or taxing and debt restrictions applicable to the parish. The court stated that since the bonds and obligations were the sole obligation of the public corporation created as authorized by the parish, they did not amount to pledging the credit of the state or its subdivision to a public corporation in violation of the art. IV, &sect;12. The court upheld the parish's plan and dismissed the complaint.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed. Plaintiff new bank had not received a certificate of authority allowing it to operate legally.

The developer filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for failure to file a bond or pay costs. In pretermitting the issue of dismissal of the appeal and affirming, the court ruled that zoning ordinances, adopted in accordance with the procedure set up in the enabling statute, were presumed to have been adopted for valid purposes and were not interfered with by the courts, unless it was clearly shown by the person challenging that the ordinance was arbitrary, unreasonable, and in violation of the enabling statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State of Louisiana appealed a summary judgment granted by a district court (Louisiana) recognizing defendant heirs of their deceased sister, the grantor of an oil, gas, and mineral lease, as owners of the sister's property. The issues included the rights of inheritance between natural brothers and sisters and, in particular, whether acknowledgement of the children by their parents under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 204 was possible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues arose in a concursus proceeding brought by plaintiff owner of the lease. The State claimed that there were no heirs and it was entitled to the property by escheat. The State alleged that the father of the decedent and her sibling heirs was a white person and their mother was a Negro. On appeal, the court held that there was a genuine and material issue of fact as to whether the parents' marriage was miscegenous. The court held that, if the marriage was miscegenous, no acknowledgment of the children was possible under art. 204, because the marriage would have been illegal under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 94. Neither article 204 of the Civil Code of 1870 nor 1870 La. Acts 68 (codified as La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:391) required a different result. Nor did a decision of the Court of Appeal of Louisiana, First Circuit, which relied on &sect; 9:391, dictate otherwise, even though the Supreme Court of Louisiana had denied a writ of certiorari in that case. The court rejected other arguments by the heirs. Acknowledgment could not be made in favor of children whose parents were prohibited from marrying at the time of conception by racial differences, bigamy, incest, or other reasons.</SPAN></P>

The public administrator was then appointed. The lower court later removed him and ordered a final accounting after appointing the administrator. The administrator sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed and remanded the judgments with an amendment reducing the administrator's commission to the public administrator.

The court could not conclude that the city acted unreasonably or that the ordinance was clearly and palpably arbitrary and discriminatory, and the court could not find that the exercise of the police power was without reason or basis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord's prior tenant defaulted on his lease and left an unpaid water bill. The water board refused service to the landlord's new tenant because of the unpaid bill and removed its water meter. No contract existed between the landlord and the water board. The court found that if property owners were held liable for water charges incurred by their tenants it would have the effect of creating a judicial or equitable lien in violation of the clear and prevailing state rule that liens and privileges could only be created by statute. The court held that the water board did not possess the right to refuse water service to the owner of a building or his tenants until either of them paid an outstanding bill for water consumed by a former tenant with whom the board contracted directly. The court found that when no contractual relationship existed with the owner prior to the furnishing of services, the water board could not force him to pay for the water consumed by a defaulting tenant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Regulation 9 prohibited, and sanctioned with quarantine, the feeding of uncooked garbage to swine.

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 3:2095 was constitutional, because the Board was not granted primary and independent discretion, but merely rule-making authority within prescribed limits, and &sect; 3:2096 was valid, in light of Louisiana Supreme Court precedent. The court found Regulation 9 did not violate due process, noting that it had a valid scientific basis, being the real threat of disease, noting that similar regulations had been enacted in 41 other states.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission, which was created by a self-operative amendment to the Louisiana Constitution, La.

The bonds were to be retired with revenues received from the lease. The taxpayer filed suit to enjoin the proposed bond issue, construction, and lease, claiming that the commission was without authority to pledge the full faith and credit of the state in issuing the bonds, and that the agreement with the private company violated the competitive bidding statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41:1211 et seq. The court affirmed a trial court judgment dismissing the taxpayer's suit. The commission was an executive department of the state and it had authority to issue bonds that were obligations of the state. The scope of the constitutional grant of authority to the commission, which expressly authorized a lease of 40 years, was greater than the scope of authority granted by the competitive bidding statute, which limited authorized leases to 10 years.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. The lounge owner pleaded the exception of no cause of action, arguing that &sect; 13:4712 was unconstitutional. The court held that &sect; 13:4712 was not an unconstitutional delegation of authority nor did it deprive anyone of the equal protection of the law. It authorized the district attorney, for and on behalf of his parish when warranted, to bring suits to abate nuisances as defined by &sect; 13:4711, as amended. There was no mandatory duty imposed upon him to bring such actions. His authority to institute and prosecute criminal proceedings against persons charged with crime was clearly and necessarily implied from the United States Constitution.

The issues were whether the district court had procedural capacity or jurisdiction to consider the union's motion for a rule to show cause why a permanent injunction should not be dissolved after a judgment became final and whether a reason for dissolution could be shown.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court had permanently enjoined the union from conducting certain activity at the corporation's plant, which the union had no legal right to engage in anyway. On that basis, the corporation argued that the union could have no basis for seeking rescission of the injunction. On appeal, the court noted that the permanent injunction was an equitable injunctive decree. The court held that the district court retained the power to alter or rescind such decrees based not only on La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 3611 but also on the district court's inherent equitable power to modify or even to revoke its own decrees. The court held that the legislature did not, by adopting La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 3607, intend to imply that the right to dissolve or modify a permanent injunction did not exist. If it had intended to deny such a right to persons subject to permanent injunctions, that attempt would be unconstitutional under La. Const. arts. 1, &sect; 6 and 7, &sect; 2.

The home as initially established by the trustees was confined to men of gentle birth, not less than 50 years of age, who were free from diseases, never inmates of public institutions, and physically able to take care of themselves. Over time, the number of men fitting that description who sought to take advantage of the home declined, a wing of the home fell into disrepair and was closed, needed assistance in their daily care became residents of the home, the financial condition of the home weakened, and the trustees considered merging the home with another organization that also cared for aged and infirm men. Alleging that the trustees were no performing the conditions of the trust in accordance with the testatrix's primary purpose, the heirs sought to revoke the trust and have the assets turned over to them.

The franchise in due course was transferred to the company. Nine years after the franchise was obtained the district was created by an ordinance of the jury, under &sect;&sect; 33:4301-4308, for the purpose of constructing a natural gas transmission and distribution system. The company later brought an action seeking to have &sect;&sect; 33:4301-4308 declared unconstitutional because it also sought to have the district declared illegally created. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment on the grounds that &sect;&sect; 33:4301-4308 was constitutional. The court held that the statute contained no provision making its effectiveness dependent upon the adoption of a constitutional amendment. The court further found that the statute contained an affirmative declaration that it was not dependent upon any other law. The court ruled that the district did not need the authority of a constitutional amendment to incur debt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State brought an expropriation action against the landowner to claim certain property for use by the State. The case was set for trial but the State and the landowner reached mutual agreement to amicably terminate the action. The parties entered into a settlement agreement that outlined that all costs of the proceedings were to be paid by the State. The landowner had hired two appraisers to testify at the trial, but they were not needed after the action was settled. However, the trial court's judgment disposing of the action in accordance with the settlement agreement mandated that the State had to pay the appraisers' fees. The State then sought review. On appeal, the court initially reversed and rendered the judgment, but on rehearing the court annulled, set aside, and reversed that judgment and affirmed the trial court's original judgment. The court held that in expropriation proceedings, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:12, the State was liable for all costs incurred by the landowner in resisting the taking of his property for public purposes, unless tender of the true value of his property was made before proceedings were instituted to condemn the property.</SPAN></P>

The court held that (1) after its amendment in 1962, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:921 sanctioned agreements not to compete only in cases where the employer had incurred an expense in the training of the employee or had incurred an expense in the advertisement of the business that the employee was engaged in; (2) the former employee's contract only enjoined him from soliciting any active or paid customers of plaintiffs, paying on active customers' accounts, revealing information regarding active accounts or plaintiffs' method of operation, and publishing his photograph for advertising purposes in a similar business; and (3) while plaintiffs' evidence of damages was not sufficient for an award, an award would be made against the former employee, not the new employer, and plaintiffs were entitled to injunctive relief against all defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens' opposition was based on Monroe, La., Ordinance No. 3263(4) and La. Rev. Stat.

Const. art. 1, &sect; 6, the legislature's authority to delegate to administrative agencies the state's power of determining the facts upon which laws were to be applied and enforced, the requirements of due process in that context, and the judicial review of administrative action. The court held that the citizens' right to file an opposition to the owner's demand for the liquor license was conferred by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:85(C). The court further held that the trial court had jurisdiction of the owner's proposed place of business and as such, was invested with the appeal from the decision of the board under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:104. The court also held that, because the owner's motion to dismiss was predicated solely upon the contention that the trial court was without jurisdiction, he had waived any argument that such review had to be sought by mandamus or regular process.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:1041 et seq, and dismissed the Board's action against defendant optometrist.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The optometrist subleased space from the retailer. The retailer's advertisements offered contact lenses and glasses upon &quot;convenient credit terms,&quot; and stated that the retailer's personnel &quot;would be happy to discuss contact lenses.&quot; The trial court enjoined the retailer from the further practice of optometry, from advertising the sale of glasses, credit terms, and discussion of contact lenses, and from duplicating eyeglass lenses without a new prescription, and dismissed with regard to the optometrist. On appeal, the court amended and affirmed. The court held that the &quot;credit terms&quot; offer was advertisement &quot;for a price&quot; in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:1063(9). The court deleted the general ban on advertising glasses as overbroad, noting that the Act did not prohibit advertising entirely. The court found duplication without a new prescription amounted to practicing optometry. The court found the offer to &quot;discuss contact lenses&quot; advertised optometrical services, and falsely implied that the retailer was so licensed, in violation of &sect; 37:1063(9),(3). The court found that the evidence was insufficient to establish an arrangement to steer customers to the optometrist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alleged owner filed suit claiming ownership of certain land by virtue of a warranty deed issued by a corporation. The lessors claimed the alleged owner's interest was extinguished because he acquired the property when it was under a mortgage that was foreclosed. The receiver filed a third party action against the lessors and lessee alleging that it was the owner because the judgment in the foreclosure proceeding was a nullity as a result of the corporation appearing through its president, and not a licensed attorney. The lessors and lessee filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the third party suit. The court affirmed, finding that the common law rule that a corporation could not appear except through counsel did not apply at the time of the foreclosure proceedings. The court held that the corporation had acquiesced in the foreclosure judgment and sheriff's sale. The court found that the receiver could not maintain a direct action under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. arts. 2002-2004 to annul the foreclosure judgment and thus it could not attack the judgment collaterally.</SPAN></P>

The committee sought review. The objection by the witness to producing the materials was grounded on an opinion rendered by the Attorney General of the State of Louisiana, that the records sought by the committee were not public records and that inasmuch as the records had been used by the grand jury, they were not subject to inspection by the committee. On appeal, the court reversed and rendered the judgment and ordered the witness ordered to comply with the subpoena duces tecum issued to him by the committee. The court held that the records were not private records because there was a legally constituted legislative committee charged with the duty, and invested with the right, to investigate a certain matter and which resulted in the compilation of the documents herein sought under the subpoena duces tecum.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the Board of Trustees, Teachers' Retirement System of Louisiana, was granted a rehearing from a judgment holding that plaintiff, the widow of the decedent, was entitled to disability retirement benefits under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:641 of the Louisiana Teachers' Retirement System, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:571 et seq., where the decedent died less than 30 days after the date fixed as the effective date of his retirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent died more than 30 days after he applied for disability retirement but less than 30 days after the date fixed by the board of trustees as the effective date of his retirement. The court originally held that the 30-day period set forth in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:641 was merely an administrative delay granted to the board of trustees to process the claim and that the decedent's widow was entitled to the benefits under the option selected by the decedent. On rehearing, the court reversed because it had based its conclusions upon a case that involved an application for benefits under the Louisiana Retirement Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:541 et seq. The court held the 30-day period provided in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:641 was not intended to be merely a delay for administrative purposes, as it originally held, but that the purpose of the delay was to minimize or to prevent death bed applications from being effective. Because the decedent died before his optional selection became effective, under the express provisions of &sect; 17:641 he had to be considered an active member of the teacher's retirement system at the time of his death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment awarding the widow disability retirement benefits and rendered judgment in favor of the board of trustees, but reserved to the widow any and all rights that she had or might have against the board of trustees for other benefits or for the refund of contributions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The distributors held wholesale liquor permits for a number of years. The board refused to issue the permits to the distributors for a specific year for the alleged failure of the distributors to meet certain requirements set forth in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:80(D), known as The Alcoholic Beverage Control Law. Specifically, the board claimed that their operations had not maintained sales of liquor to retailers generally within their immediate trade area. The distributors then brought an action against the board attacking the constitutionality of &sect; 26:80(D), and seeking injunctive relief against the enforcement of the provisions there of enjoining the board from refusing to issue to them wholesale liquor permits. The trial court dismissed the actions and the distributors sought review. On appeal, the court reversed and rendered the judgments on the grounds that it found that &sect; 26:80(D), was unconstitutional, null, and void. The court held it unconstitutional because its standards failed to have any legitimate relationship to the declared purpose of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law.

He refused to testify at the commission hearing. The commission, inter alia, disqualified him from eligibility for a position for 10 years, under La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 15(P)(1). He urged, inter alia, that he was denied due process by the imposition of the disqualification for exercising his right against self-incrimination by declining to testify. In affirming the commission's ruling, the court found that his discharge was legally justified on the facts found by the commission. The court found that art. XIV, &sect; 15(P)(1) was a reasonable exercise of the State's police power and was within the limits of due process. The court opined that he was not disqualified from Civil Service employment because of any assumption from his having invoked the Fifth Amendment, but rather because of his refusal to testify before the commission, the very act of which directly bore upon his fitness and suitability for public service.</SPAN></P>

The trusts were to be created from the residue of the grandmother's estate following the disbursement of specific bequests. The granddaughter sought to nullify those testamentary trusts.

Code Ann. art. 1520, and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:1791, as well as powers of appointment contrary to La. Civ.

The trial court rendered judgment in the granddaughter's favor and declared the trusts created in the residuary clause of the grandmother's will to be null and void. Consequently, the probate of the will was annulled. Because the trust was invalid, the property subject thereto fell into intestacy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voter group maintained that La. Rev. Stat.

The trial court disagreed. On review, the court affirmed because it found that the requirement of La. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 9 (1921) that presidential electors be chosen or elected in the manner prescribed by law was satisfied by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:1381, and other pertinent statutes. However, it also found, as did the trial court, that the political committees could not lawfully nominate more than 10 candidates for the office of Presidential Elector in the forthcoming general election since only 10 electors were to be chosen at the election.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which found the challenged statute pertaining to nomination of candidates for presidential electors was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state officials forfeited the bonds of several criminal defendants insured by the bondsman, and sought to collect on the forfeitures. The bondsman filed an action in the Civil District Court to enjoin enforcement of the forfeitures. The Civil District Court dismissed the action, based upon the requirements of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 15:108 and La. Const. art. 7, &sect;&sect; 81, 83, and 29, which separated the jurisdictions of criminal and civil courts in the Parish of Orleans. The bondsman filed a petition for writ of certiorari and mandamus toward the lower court. The court held that because the Parish of Orleans divided the criminal and civil courts constitutionally and by procedural rule, a forfeiture proceeding regarding criminal bonds was also a criminal action. As a criminal action, the bond forfeiture and appeals therefrom were within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Civil District Court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from the dismissal of a property owner's action seeking to prevent a city and agency from interfering with the performance of work on the owner's premises, the court affirmed. The owner had certain vacant property, and he had certain plumbing work performed on the premises, which work was duly inspected and approved by the proper authorities. An electrical company which the owner engaged was advised by a city agency not to perform work requested by the owner. Subsequently, a city ordinance was passed which amended Article XV Section 2(17) of the General Zoning Ordinance by eliminating trailer parks from the list of businesses permitted in Zone F. The owner's vacant land was in Zone F. The court stated that trailer courts were permitted in Zone F both at the time the owner made application for a use permit and at the time he filed suit. However, before the matter was heard by the court, the zoning ordinance was amended so that they were no longer permitted. The court held that an ordinance could be validly passed after the making of such application which would prohibit the issuance of the permit. The court was obliged to take judicial cognizance of an ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The commission then denied its jurisdiction to hear the employee's appeal of the decision basing its decision on Civil Service Commission Rule 12.9, which divested the commission of jurisdiction in retirement cases. The court reversed and remanded. Specifically, the court held that, pursuant to La.

The contractor brought a writ of mandamus seeking an order requiring the board to issue him a license. The contractor contended that he was exempt under the ordinance from taking a written examination because he was of good character, was a graduate of a trade school for electricians, and had more than five years experience. The board appealed the trial court's judgment favoring the contractor. The court reversed. Although the language of the code was ambiguous regarding whether certain candidates were exempted from the examination, the court noted that the board had always interpreted the code as requiring all applicants as having to take a written examination to determine their qualifications for license. The court held that the board's practical, contemporaneous construction of the ordinance furthered the purpose of the ordinance, which was to protect the public, and therefore the board's interpretation that the code required an examination of all applicants was decisive in light of the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a well was drilled by the operator at its expense, upon application of the co-owner the Commissioner of Conservation created a drilling and production unit which unitized an area around the well and designated the well as the well for the unit. The operator contended that it was entitled to recover the proportionate part of the adjusted well costs from the co-owner in cash. The co-owner contended that the operator could only recover from the proceeds of production from the well accruing to the co-owner. The court held that when the co-owner requested unitization of the well already successfully completed by the operator the co-owner became a joint adventurer. The court held that the Louisiana Conservation Act and the reciprocal nature of the rights and obligations created by the pooling and unitization order, whereby the operations of the operator inured to the benefit of the co-owner, required the co-owner to share the operator's drilling expenses, and to contribute thereto in the same manner as they were disbursed by the operator.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner of Conservation unitized some 26 acres of the parent tract that surrounded an already-producing unit well.

In reversing its earlier judgment, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that the property owner was entitled to a cancellation of the royalty interests of the royalty owners under the 10-year prescription rule on the grounds that the producing well was not situated on the parent tract and that its operation did not interrupt the running of the prescription.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff attorney obtained the passage of a bill to allow 50 or more landowners to obtain mineral rights over vast tracts of land, held by 500 or more owners. After passage of the bill, the attorney obtained the consent of at least 50 owners, and entered into lease agreements with oil companies. The oil companies paid royalties, which were paid into a fund. The attorney applied to the court for a portion of the royalties, claiming that he was entitled to a percentage due to his efforts. The trial court granted him a fee, and the lessors appealed the ruling. The court held that under the trust fund doctrine, where an attorney alone and at his own expense had successfully maintained an action for the preservation, protection, increase, or creation of a fund in which persons other than his own clients might share or from which they might benefit, equity required that all who benefited must pay the costs and expenses incident thereto, including attorney's fees.

The court held that the district court did not err in refusing to declare the special exception use void. The court concluded that the City of Shreveport, La., Zoning Ordinance, particularly 1954 La.

In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that the tax imposed by the Sales Tax Act on the rental of the barges was not a tax upon the right to use the Mississippi River or navigable waters and did not interfere or obstruct the full use of such waters. The court also rejected the taxpayers' contention that the tax on the rentals paid to the owners amounted to double taxation. The taxpayers were liable for the taxes under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:302(B)(2) because the rentals were not an established business of the owners of the barges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporations owned and operated commercial establishments in New Orleans which sold shoes and they filed an action seeking to enjoin defendants from selling shoes on Sundays. The trial court granted the injunction and defendants appealed. The court affirmed the injunction, holding that the sale of shoes was within the definition of wearing apparel and thus was within the intended prohibition of sales on Sundays under &sect; 51:194. The court found that a local merchant such as the corporations herein had proper standing to bring such an action. Additionally, the court found no violations of the Louisiana or United State Constitutions by the legislation, which was deemed a proper exercise of the State's police power. The statute, at least as applied to the sale of shoes, was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The Board filed an exception to venue, claiming that another district was the proper forum and the court decided that venue in the original district was proper. Following remand, La. Rev. Stat.

The court reversed and remanded. The court found that the venue issue had become final when the court issued the interlocutory order, pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 2083, and that the funeral home would be deprived of a vested right given it by the final order if venue were to be transferred again. Further, because La. Const. art.

The court held that the pilot was given the opportunity to present evidence at the hearing and to explain his position with respect to the accidents. The court held that while there was no record made, it was a formal hearing. Further, the court held that there was no due process violation because the pilot was accorded a privilege when he was issued a pilot's commission by the governor, not an inalienable right, and the governor, in the exercise of its police power may withdraw it.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. art. 509, as owners of lands adjoining rivers or streams, they were entitled to the accretions that formed successively and imperceptibly attached to the shore. Considerable expert testimony was presented regarding the geographical characteristics of the area, specifically whether the area constituted a stream or a lake, and whether the alluvial deposits were formed in the ordinary cause of nature or by artificial flow caused by man. The trial court ruled in favor of the landowners. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the body of water was in fact a stream as distinguished from a lake because it was proven to be water containing currents of sufficient velocity to carry alluvial materials. The court found that the accretions had formed naturally prior to the State's lease of the property and therefore belonged to the landowners.</SPAN></P>

Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 18:1702, 362, an election contest became moot when the secretary of state became under a mandatory duty to furnish absentee ballots in 30 days, even if the ballots had not actually been printed. The district court heard the case 21 days before the second primary election date; thus, the action was moot. The candidate argued that the statutes deprived election contestants of the right to attack an election in violation of La. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 12. His attack was untimely filed because it was not brought within 2 days after election results were officially promulgated, as required under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:364(H).

The court determined that the civil court was not deprived of the power to abate the nuisance because of the fact that maintaining a nuisance could also be a crime. The court rejected defendants' constitutional exception, finding that even unlawful administration of a statute was not a denial of equal protection unless there was shown to be present an element of intentional or purposeful discrimination. Finally, the court concluded that there could be no doubt that the evidence proved the carrying on and existence of assignation, obscenity as defined in La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged the Commission's finding that the job seeker had been discriminated against in her State employment. The job seeker applied for a regional public welfare directorship, a classified civil service position, and was hired after establishing her eligibility for the job and being interviewed. Before the job seeker reported for her first day of work, a State representative told the State's welfare director that he had reason to doubt the job seeker's fitness for the position, causing the director to withdraw the offer. On appeal, the court held that the job seeker's acceptance of the oral job offer constituted an &quot;appointment&quot; to the classified civil service, even though she had not yet reported for duty. The job seeker's employment rights vested upon acceptance, and she was protected by Commission rules prohibiting political discrimination in the State's workplace. The director abused her discretion in cancelling the job seeker's appointment.</SPAN></P>

The mayor's collateral attack on the municipal civil service board's legality was not cognizable because the issue was not raised in the proceedings below. Section 33:2481 did not unconstitutionally enlarge La. Const. art. XIV, &sect;15.1, by including city police departments within the constitutional provision for the creation of civil service boards in cities of certain populations. A special legislative act affecting the City of Houma, Act 145 of 1958, did not alter the substance of the Lawrason Act of 1898(Act), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:381.

The court noted that after the execution of the contract between the marble company and the subcontractor, an amendment to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38:2247 became effective. The amendment provided that the marble company was required to record and file its lien to protect its cause of action against the general contractor and surety in the event of the subcontractor's default.

On appeal, the court supported the conclusion of the trial court, finding that the appointed director's experience as a shipping clerk did not qualify as a responsible managerial or administrative position. Additionally, the court found that the action was not mooted by the fact that the appointed director had since gained more than the requisite five years experience because any experience gained after his appointment to director could not be considered.

The court held that the municipality which appropriated property in violation of the Louisiana Constitution without prior judicial authority for the taking had to pay trespass damages in a suit by the landowner to recover for this illegal taking. In such an instance, the property owner should receive only the value of the land taken and the municipality thus was liable only for the same amount as if it had expropriated in accordance with law. The property owner and the municipality both presented the district court with an appraisal value. It was not error for the district court to give credit to the municipality's appraisal value.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an expropriation proceeding, plaintiff Department of Highways challenged the decision of a Louisiana trial court decreeing that a supplemental order of expropriation for servitude on defendant owners' land as a borrow pit for construction of a highway was rescinded and set aside because the Department had not complied with 1954 La. Acts 107, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 48:441 to 48:460 (1954) (the Act), by not tendering compensation into court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After acquiring a servitude over a tract of land on one side of a highway construction project for a borrow pit, the Department sought a supplemental order for a pit on the other side of the highway, but did not place any funds on deposit with the trial court based on reasonable value. The court issued the amended order substituting one tract of land for the other. On application of the owners, the court rescinded its supplemental order. On review, the Department argued that it could not be divested under the Act unless the owners could show that the land was not taken for a public purpose. The court disagreed, finding that the Department had not &quot;acquired title under the provisions&quot; of the Act as stated in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:460 (1954), and would not be entitled to the statutory protection against divestiture of title. The court reasoned that such a construction of the statute was in harmony with the constitutional prohibition against the taking of property without just compensation contained in La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 19.1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife's petition alleged that the accident occurred in the State of Mississippi while she was a passenger in an automobile owned and operated by her husband. The wife asserted that she received her injuries when the automobile left the highway and plunged down an embankment and that the accident was caused by her husband's negligence in exceeding the speed limit, in failing to keep a proper lookout, and in failing to maintain proper control over the automobile. Defendants based their exception on contentions that under the controlling law of Mississippi, a wife could not sue her husband for torts committed during coverture. Upon review, the court affirmed the judgment below, holding that because the alleged tort was committed in Mississippi, the substantive law of that State was controlling and that Mississippi did not recognize the right of a wife to sue her husband for torts committed during coverture or her right to maintain an action against her husband's insurer.</SPAN></P>

The officers initiated a quo warranto proceeding under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. arts. 3901, 3902, and La. Rev. Stat.

The district court dismissed the officer's suit, and the officers appealed. The court reversed and held that the officers were entitled to their respective offices because one officer vacated his membership on the board when he accepted an office of trust and profit under the federal government. The court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:60(D), governing the election of officers of the Jefferson Parish School Board, was an unconstitutional local or special law prohibited by La.

Defendants, the bank and its insurer, filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that plaintiffs' exclusive remedy was workmen's compensation benefits. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs' suit. Plaintiffs appealed. The court agreed that plaintiffs' injuries arose out of their employment given when the robber had entered the bank that the two employees were forced at gun point to accompany the robber to the place where they were shot. Therefore, plaintiffs' exclusive remedy under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1166 was workmen's compensation. The trial court judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The employee worked as a chef steward and was sent by his employer to an offshore rig. He was instructed by his employer to drive to his employer's home office to drop off rig reports and laundry, where he dined with his supervisors. Upon leaving to return home, he was involved in an automobile accident and received serious permanent injuries. On appeal, the court concluded that under the alleged facts, recovery was exclusively vested under the Jones Act. The court noted that the U.S. Constitution obliterated the right of the state to grant to a seaman injured within the scope of his employment relief under the state workmen's compensation acts.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the trial court properly found that the company did not discharge its burden of proof of public demand, necessity, use, or purpose. Thus, the company failed to show that the construction of the pipeline was necessary in order to serve and meet the public demand for natural gas. The evidence showed that the area was already being served by another natural gas company, that the proposed line would only serve two customers, one of which was already being served by the other natural gas company, and that the other natural gas company was able and willing to serve all of the customers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' third-party demand alleged that the minors' father was a joint tortfeasor. Defendants, thus, made the insurer of the parents' vehicle, the tutor in his capacity as tutor of the minors, and the minors, through their said tutor, third-party defendants. Defendants sought contribution from third-party defendants to the extent of one-half of any judgment against defendants. The court affirmed the judgment insofar as it dismissed the third-party demand against the minors, finding that the minors could not be considered joint tortfeasors because they were not involved in the accident. The court reversed the judgment insofar as it dismissed the remaining third-party demands. The court held that defendants in wrongful death actions were entitled to implead and demand contribution from an alleged co-tortfeasor. The court rejected the tutor's assertion that La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1111 did not permit impleading the original plaintiff in an action, finding no language in art. 1111 that precluded impleading a plaintiff as a third-party defendant. The court also concluded that the father's estate was properly impleaded as a third-party defendant through the minors' tutor.</SPAN></P>

The district court rendered judgment annulling the promulgation of the results of the election. On appeal, the parish council claimed that the lower court erred. The court affirmed the judgment holding that there were many irregularities in the conduct of the election in addition to those claimed by plaintiff.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer was employed by a board of levee commissioners. He and the child became involved in an altercation in a restaurant on property owned by the board, and the child was injured. The father brought an action to recover damages consisting of medical expenses, loss of wages, and personal injuries sustained by the child. The trial court rendered judgment upon a jury verdict in favor of the father and against the police officer and the officer's insurer. The insurer and the officer appealed. The court concluded that the trial court correctly overruled the insurer's exception of no right or cause of action. The defense of governmental immunity to tort liability that was available to insured governmental bodies, agencies, or subdivisions was not available to and could not be pleaded by a public insurance carrier. The attack made by the police officer upon the minor was entirely unprovoked and unjustified under the facts as found in the record and constituted a tortious act. The amount awarded by the jury for the minor's loss of wages was inadequate under the evidence, and the amount awarded as to the minor's personal injury was grossly inadequate.</SPAN></P>

The first patent was defective, and a warrant was issued, and a second patent was issued for the land eventually conveyed to her husband. The State argued that the second patent was issued in contravention of the La. Const. art. 4, &sect; 2 (1921).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chain of title to the property in question involved the post-1921 issuance of a patent to an individual after he found land satisfying a warrant issued on account of a defective patent issued to another individual. The defective patent was issued before 1921. The widow brought an action claiming ownership of the property at issue through her husband. The trial court decided that she was the owner of the property. On appeal, the State claimed that because the La. Const. art. 4, &sect; 2 generally required the State to reserve a mineral interest on land sold by it, and there was no mineral interest reserved by the second patent, it was the owner. On appeal, the court found that &sect; 2 did not apply. The court held that the application of &sect; 2 had to be limited strictly to property sold by the State since the adoption of the 1921 Constitution. The property delivered per the second patent was in final consummation of a sale made on the first patent and in fulfillment of the obligation then assumed by the State, which accepted the consideration from the first patentee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensed optometrist was employed by an optometry business that was a corporation. The board issued a resolution that prohibited optometrists from accepting employment as optometrists from corporations and that stated that such prohibited employment would be considered to be in violation of La.

On appeal, the court disagreed and rendered judgment for the board. The court reasoned that because La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:1049 required a practitioner of optometry to be a person and, inter alia, a person that was a citizen of the United States, a corporation could not be licensed to practice optometry, and, ergo, any professional connection with a corporation by a licensed optometrist would violate La.

The court held that the trial court was correct in dismissing the relators' suit, as the relators had a period of six months within which to meet the requirements of the Commissioner but failed to do so. The court found that that the relators failed to show that the Commissioner acted arbitrarily or capriciously in refusing to issue their permit. The court further held that La. Rev. Stat.

The landowners alleged that in reliance on these invalid provisions, the Department had violated their constitutional property rights by going on to their property, taking soil samples, and finalizing plans to take their land. The district court found that there was no justiciable controversy and denied the landowners' request for a declaratory judgment under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In her motion to dismiss the appeal, the license holder argued that the issue presented was moot for two reasons: (1) the date fixed for the hearing (November 6, 1961) to be conducted had passed; and (2) the license holder's 1961 licenses and permits to retail alcoholic beverages expired January 1, 1962; consequently, the board had no license or permit to consider at any hearing. The issue was whether or not the trial court improvidently issued the preliminary injunction restraining the board from holding its hearing. The appellate court concluded that while the notice for the hearing only mentioned the 1961 licenses and permits, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:79(A)(6), (7), specifically stated that no permit could be granted to a person who had had a permit revoked within one year prior to the application and that no permit could be granted to a person who had been adjudged by the board to have violated any of the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 1, tit. 26. There was a license to revoke at the time that the injunction was issued. Thus, the revocation of the license holder's 1961 license was not a moot question.</SPAN></P>

The corporation denied that the amount in issue represented borrowed capital as defined by the corporation franchise tax statute (the statute), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:603. The trial court ruled that all but a small amount asserted by the collector was actually owed. The collector then sought review. On appeal, the court reviewed the finding below that refinancing had not been shown and examined the financing methods used by the corporation. The court rejected the collector's assertion that the majority of the corporation's indebtedness had been re-financed based primarily upon the collector's own witness who was unable to testify with any confidence that the amounts at issue qualified for taxation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two suits, petitioners filed mandamus proceedings against the mineral board to require it to perform certain ministerial duties. The suits were consolidated and judgment was entered in favor of petitioners, which made the alternative writ of mandamus peremptory. In amending the judgment, the court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:186 et seq. was presumed to be constitutional because it had not been declared unconstitutional by final decision of the courts. However, because La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:186 was presumed constitutional until declared otherwise, no liability would result from a strict compliance with its provisions. Further, the issues raised in one case in which the a percentage of the fund held by the mineral board was sought was not properly before the court for consideration in reviewing the decision to issue the writ of mandamus because there was no consolidation of that suit with the instant case nor an exception of lis pendens filed and upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State instituted an expropriation proceeding for the taking of the landowner's property and deposited a sum equal to its appraisal of the property with the trial court. The landowner answered, seeking an increase in compensation. Following a trial on the merits, the trial court rendered judgment establishing a value of the property in excess of the State's appraisal but less than the amount asserted by the landowner. Both parties appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that the trial court properly accepted as comparables only properties used by both the State's and the landowner's experts in finding the value of the property. The trial court did not err in excluding other properties in determining value where they were located some distance from the subject property and where too many allowances and adjustments would be necessary in order make a comparison to the subject property. Further, costs associated with expert witness fees were properly awarded to the landowner under La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2 (1921), under which expenses incurred by a landowner in enforcing his rights must be awarded in order to ensure that he receive full and just compensation for his property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment creditor was injured when a truck owned by the Louisiana Department of Highways struck him. The judgment creditor commenced suit against the Department. The Department called upon its insurer to defend. It refused to do so, but provided counsel under a non-waiver agreement. The judgment creditor prevailed in the underlying action and commenced suit against the insurer to recover. The Department intervened on the judgment creditor's behalf. The trial court found for the judgment creditor. The insurer sought review. The court affirmed. The court held that the Department had a legal obligation to pay the judgment creditor, thus, the insurer was required to pay the judgment creditor under the terms of the policy. The court reasoned that the doctrine of res adjudicata did not apply because the first suit brought against the insurer, that was subsequently dismissed, was a direct action, the second was a suit on a contract of insurance. The court opined that 1954 La. Acts 676, which allowed suit to be brought was constitutional. The court concluded that the doctrine of prescription did not apply because there was a 10-year prescription period for actions brought in contract.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:501 et seq., were ultra vires, illegal, and void in usurping the mayor's authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The majority council members adopted two ordinances and a resolution placing in council the authority to hire employees and establishing an administrative structure. The mayor filed suit challenging their authority. On appeal from the district court's adverse judgment, the council members argued that the council had the power to administer the city government under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 501 to 570. In reversing, the court ruled that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:531 granted to the council the exercise of all powers, duties, and functions formerly exercised by municipal officials, including the mayor, prior to the municipality's conversion to the commission form of government and that, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:523, this included the power to hire and fire employees and administrative officials. The court held that the ordinances and the resolution were entirely proper in exercising the council's power to administer the various city departments, to employ all municipal officers and employees, and to fix their compensation and departmental assignments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agency instituted the suit to expropriate land owned by defendant. The agency deposited into the court registry the asserted fair market value of the land pursuant to the trial court's judgment transferring the property. The landowner answered more than four months after the agency's petition was filed and served, seeking additional compensation. The court affirmed the trial court's conclusion that the landowner waived the right to claim additional compensation by failing to file his answer timely. The court rejected the landowner's contention that the right to claim additional compensation was not one of the defenses contemplated by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 48:447, 48:450, or 48:452. The court held that the language of &sect; 48:447, which provided that a defendant waived all defenses except a claim for compensation by failing timely to file a motion to dismiss the state's suit, left no doubt that claims for compensation were defenses contemplated by those statutes. If the legislature had intended to reserve the right to defendant to claim additional compensation, even though he failed to answer timely, it would have specifically provided therefor in &sect; 48:452 as it did in &sect; 48:447.</SPAN></P>
