</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners paid their taxes under protest and brought an action against defendants. The county tax collector then filed an application for judgment against the property and filed the required affidavit. After a trial, the trial court entered a judgment nunc pro tunc as to its earlier oral order. Three months later that judgment was vacated, but upon rehearing the judgment was again entered nunc pro tunc as to the earlier oral order date. The owners alleged that the judgment nunc pro tunc by the trial court was inappropriate and that their claim was not properly processed. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the judgment nunc pro tunc was appropriate because it referenced a minute order stating that a written order was to be issued. The court also held that defendants were not required to file written pleading because under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 235 no additional pleadings aside from the collector's complaint for a tax judgment was required of defendants. The court also ruled that the owners did not sustain their burden of proof that the taxes were improperly assessed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A juvenile court action was brought to enable adoption of a six-year-old by his foster parents, who had cared for and supported him since he was an infant. Testimony at the termination hearing was given by two social workers, the foster mother, the child, the mother, the mother's boyfriend, and a court psychiatrist. The mother was found unfit under the Ill. Adoption Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 4, para. 9.1-1(D) (1973). Her arguments that the statute violated due process and ex post facto laws had been waived since she had not raised them at trial. In addition, the court found &sect; 1D(l) of the Act was not unconstitutionally applied retroactively in violation of the ex post facto laws of the U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 9, and was valid under those laws, since it did not affect criminal liability nor a vested property right. The court affirmed the unfitness finding and termination. The evidence unequivocally satisfied the standard. The mother's failure to make reasonable progress toward the return of her child coupled with her failure to manifest any interest in her child for a period of six years were sufficient to constitute &quot;unfitness&quot; as defined under the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. The statute was valid and did not violate due process. The evidence unequivocally satisfied the standard. The trial court properly entered an order permitting adoption.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the offense of drunken driving could not be committed on private property and that he was not shown to have been actually driving a vehicle. The court affirmed the conviction and ruled that the term &quot;driving&quot; was used to include both the actual operation of a moving vehicle and the circumstances of being &quot;in actual physical control&quot; of the vehicle even though the vehicle was not moving and that it was not necessary that defendant was actually operating a moving vehicle to prove a violation under &sect; 11-501 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95-1/2, para. 11-501 (1973). The court further ruled that the offense of drunken driving could be committed on private property without a showing that the property was put to some public use and that the court's construction making the statute applicable to incidents on private property did not render the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant policeman challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which affirmed the decision of appellee police board to discharge the policeman from service for violating Rule 2 of the Police Department of Chicago Ill., which prohibited any action which impeded the department's effort to achieve its goals or brought discredit upon the department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charge against the policeman arose from an out of state altercation with a man while the policeman was off duty. The man started a fight with the policeman. When the policeman went to draw his gun, the gun fired three times, hitting both the man and the policeman. The policeman made several arguments against the decision to discharge him. His claim that the evidence before the board did not constitute cause for dismissal from the police force was the only one that the court considered. The court noted that the pivotal question was not whether the board's decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence, but whether under that evidence there was sufficient cause to remove him from the police department. The court noted that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 10-1-18.1 (1973) provided that no officer could be discharged except for cause. The court noted that while an administrative agency's findings on questions of fact were prima facie true and correct, the same was not true as to its findings of cause. The court found that the policeman had legally defended himself in the face of an assault, which did not support the board's imposition of the maximum punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, which had affirmed the board's decision, and remanded the cause with directions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner filed a request to change the zoning ordinance of its property to general residential with a special use permit to build a multiple-family residential development. The board of appeals recommended that the request be denied. The board of commissioners denied the request. The owner filed a complaint in the lower court for a declaratory judgment challenging the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance as applied to the owner's property and requesting that the lower court declare that the owner had the right to use its property for a residential planned development. The lower court ruled in favor of the county and residents. The owner appealed and the court held that the county could enforce enforce height restrictions because it was concerned with the health, welfare and safety of people who live or work near an airfield, the ordinance was not void because it did not conflict with FAA regulations or violate the supremacy clause of article VI of the United States Constitution, and that the ordinance did not violate the owner's due process rights because the height restriction ordinance did not appropriate private property for public use.</SPAN></P>

His conviction was affirmed on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State presented an alibi rebuttal witness who was not identified in the State's list of witnesses. Defendant contended that the use of the rebuttal witness constituted unfair surprise because he was required by statute to disclose his alibi witnesses. He argued that his conviction should have been reversed under a United States Supreme Court decision that held that a statute requiring a defendant to disclose his alibi witnesses, while exempting the State's rebuttal witnesses from discovery, was unconstitutional. The court affirmed, holding that the State's failure to disclose the identity of its alibi rebuttal witness prior to defendant's trial was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt because the victims positively identified defendant at the trial and defendant was apprised prior to the trial that the witness might be called to establish defendant's presence in the area when the offenses were committed. In was unlikely that defendant was surprised when the witness appeared as an alibi rebuttal witness because defendant received a list of witnesses, which included the witness, in an indictment for another robbery that occurred on the same date and in the same neighborhood.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer was called as a defense witness in a murder trial. During the trial, the officer's superiors in the police department ordered him to make a statement and submit to a polygraph examination. The judge in the murder trial ordered the officer not to make a statement until the conclusion of the case. After the trial ended, the officer's superiors again ordered him to submit to a polygraph test. He refused, citing the judge's order. As a result, the officer was suspended for 30 days without pay. He brought an action against defendants, who claimed that the police superintendent had the power to suspend the officer under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 10-1-18.1 (1971). The trial court granted the officer's petition for a writ of mandamus, and the court affirmed. The court held that the judge in the murder case retained jurisdiction over the case until an appeal was filed. An appeal had not yet been filed at the time the officer's superiors ordered him to take a polygraph test. Thus, the officer was obliged to comply with the judge's order at that time, and the superintendent's order to suspend the officer was an abuse of his discretion. Mandamus was an appropriate remedy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted her of the offense of prostitution by agreeing to perform an act of deviate sexual conduct for money in violation of Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal of her conviction for prostitution, defendant argued that (1) Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-14 (1973) was unconstitutional either on its face or as applied in the instant prosecution; (2) she was not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) the trial court erred in denying her motion for a new trial; and (4) a fatal variance existed between the charge in the complaint and the proofs adduced at trial. Upon review, the court agreed with defendant's contention as to a fatal variance. The complaint charged that defendant committed an act of prostitution by agreeing to perform an act of deviate sexual conduct for money. At trial, the police officer was the only witness who appeared for the State, and his testimony, if accepted at face value, clearly established that defendant only offered to perform an act of deviate sexual conduct for money. The evidence presented did not support a finding of guilty as to the charge in the complaint, and therefore resulted in a fatal variance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his petition because (1) he was not engaged in the business of selling cigarettes in Illinois; (2) the Illinois Cigarette Tax Act, if applicable, was unconstitutional; (3) the guilty plea agreement was breached by the State; (4) the search of his vehicle was illegal; and (5) the prosecution was barred by a certain class action injunction. Upon review, the court found defendant's arguments without merit. The fine imposed was separate and distinct from the civil penalty. The contention that the plea agreement was entered with the intent to preclude the Illinois Department of Revenue from pursuing civil administrative remedies against defendant was not supported by the record. Defendant's failure to pursue a ruling on his motion to suppress rendered the claim of an unconstitutional search untimely when raised for the first time in the post-conviction petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An accident occurred when defendant proceeded into an intersection after she had stopped at a stop sign. A van proceeding at approximately 35 m.p.h. on a preferential one-way street hit defendant's vehicle. Defendant was found guilty of failure to yield the right-of-way. The court assessed a fine, costs, a conviction fee, and a State attorney's per diem fee. Defendant appealed, contending that she had not been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and that the per diem and conviction fees were unconstitutional. The court disagreed, holding that, after stopping at the stop sign, defendant was required to yield the right-of-way to any vehicle entering the intersection or so close as to present an immediate hazard. Because defendant was on the nonpreferential street and was involved in a collision at the intersection, the collision was prima facie evidence of her failure to yield. The fact the van on the preferential street may have been speeding did not necessarily relieve defendant from the duty imposed by statute. There was a legitimate governmental interest in recovering the costs of the administration of justice, and there is no denial of due process in doing so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of heroin. Defendant appealed on the grounds that the circuit court erred in refusing to quash a search warrant and to suppress physical evidence seized, that the circuit court incorrectly instructed the jury about defendant's burden of going forward with evidence of unfitness, and that the circuit court erred in admitting evidence of prior criminal offenses. On review, the court reversed and remanded because the circuit court should have instructed the jury that defendant had the burden of going forward with evidence of unfitness, and after doing so, the burden shifted to the State to prove defendant's fitness by a preponderance of the evidence. In addition, the court ruled that failure to instruct the jury correctly was reversible error, and a new trial had to be held to preserve the constitutional right of defendant not to be tried while unfit. Finally, the court ruled that prior sales were admissible, but each case had to be determined from the facts as to whether the evidence of other crimes was so closely connected with the main issue that it tended to prove defendant guilty of the crime for which she was being tried.</SPAN></P>

The corporation filed a complaint seeking a rescission of the payment and a refund, together with interest. The circuit court denied the secretary of state's motion for summary judgment and his motion to dismiss the claim. The secretary of state contended that the doctrine of sovereign immunity barred the proceedings for monetary recovery against the state.

He argued that he had been denied equal protection. At issue on appeal was the prospective or retroactive effect of subsequent decisions favorable to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father had a daughter born out of wedlock. The child's mother died three years later. Almost 10 years later, the circuit court entered a decree of adoption to the foster parents under the Illinois Adoption Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 4, paras. 9.1-1, -8 (1971), which permitted adoption without notice to or consent of the unwed father. Two years later the father asked that the decree be vacated and he be given custody. He argued that the adoption statute and &sect; 12 of the Paternity Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 106 3/4, para. 62 (1969), were unconstitutional. Shortly after the decree was entered, and prior to the father's petition, the Illinois Supreme Court had decided two cases in which the three statutes were declared unconstitutional and it was held that an unwed father was entitled to a hearing in adoption proceedings. The father argued that these decisions should have been applied retroactively to his case. The court disagreed, applying the three Chevron criteria to determine whether retroactive application of the Illinois decisions was proper. Placing the most emphasis on the element of reliance, and the child's welfare, it found it was not. The dismissal was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment dismissing the father's petition was affirmed, as prospective application was the proper application of the cases holding unconstitutional the statutes unfavorable to him so they could not be applied to his case and disrupt the settled family structure into which his daughter had been adopted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from the Circuit Court of Ogle County (Illinois), which convicted them for violation of the Illinois juvenile curfew law, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23, para. 2371 (1973). Defendants claimed that the curfew was a constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Illinois juvenile curfew prevented persons under the age of 18 from being present in a public place without a companion over the age of 21 during certain hours of each day. The court examined curfew laws generally and noted that those based on military or emergency situations that were limited for the duration of the emergency were generally upheld, while juvenile curfew laws had an uneven success rate in the courts. The court concluded that freedom of movement was necessary to enjoy fundamental First Amendment freedoms and therefore concluded that freedom of movement was also a fundamental freedom. As a fundamental freedom it was also protected by the Fourteenth Amendment against intrusion by the states. The court also concluded that fundamental freedoms were not limited to persons over the age of 18 and therefore held that the curfew law was invalid. The law was not limited in time or scope, and it applied statewide, despite the substantial diversity of circumstances that existed across the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a paid informant was used in the investigation, defendant was convicted of delivering a controlled substance to a state special agent. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the improper admission of evidence and the prosecutor's arguments on a witness' previous unrelated sale of narcotics to the special agent were prejudicial to defendant's case. The court also determined that the prosecutor's derogatory references to defendant's counsel did not aid the jury in evaluating the evidence but tended to arouse antagonism against defendant. However, the trial court did not err in limiting the cross-examination of the special agent on issues unrelated to proper impeachment, nor did it err in refusing to identify an informant who was neither a participant nor a witness to the essential elements of delivery. It was entirely proper for the trial court to instruct the jury by defining the crime charged in the language of the statute, and the evidence presented to the jury proved defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather than an absence of evidence, there was merely a conflict in the evidence that was resolved by the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that since the Parole and Pardon Board had the power to determine a parole violation and to impose an additional term of confinement if it determined a condition of parol had been violated, without further judicial process, there was an invasion of the judicial power by an administrative body and under the separation of powers doctrine such exercise of judicial power was unconstitutional. The court held that the issue presented was whether the mandatory parole term provided by the Unified Code of Corrections was unconstitutional. The court noted that the question of constitutionality of the mandatory parole provision was raised for the first time. However, the court held that because the situation had not developed to the point of parole and no injury had yet occurred, the court rejected the constitutional argument raised by the defendants.

As a result of her persistence in refusing to allow defendant to speak to his brother, defendant became perturbed and resorted to intemperate language.

The state placed heavy emphasis on the verbiage spoken by defendant as evincing the statutory requisite intent to annoy or harass. The court, in reversing the decision of the trial court, held that the entire circumstances must be considered before adjudicating whether defendant was guilty of disorderly conduct.

The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the trial court fully complied with Ill. Sup. Ct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the State's evidence was insufficient because it was circumstantial and he had produced testimony from several witnesses in support of his alibi defense.

Identification evidence was properly admitted because there was testimony that the eyewitness had a sufficient opportunity to see defendant's face. The court agreed that the alibi defense statute was unconstitutional, but held that its application was harmless error. The State already knew of defendant's alibi witnesses, so the requirement of giving notice was a mere formality.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant committed the acts with his adopted daughter. On appeal, he claimed that the aggravated incest statute violated Ill. Const. art.

Stat. ch. 38, para. 11 -- 10(a)(b) (1973) punished men for sexual acts with biological daughters, adopted daughters, and stepdaughters, while Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11 -- 11(a) (1973) punished women for similar conduct with biological sons but not adopted sons or stepsons. The court held that the provisions of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 18 (1970) were self-executing and that defendant's conviction for aggravated incest was based on unconstitutional discrimination. The court found that equal protection and due process were not violated by the fact that a prosecutor had discretion whether to charge conduct as either indecent liberties with a child or contributing to the sexual delinquency, which had disparate sentences. The court also held that a resentencing on the indecent liberties charge was not required when the trial court considered the charges and all related factors separately.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated incest for having sexual intercourse with his daughters. He contended on appeal, that the aggravated incest statute discriminated against male parents solely on the basis of sex in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Ill. Const. art. 1, &sect; 18. Defendant based his argument on the fact that while a father convicted of aggravated incest could be sentenced to a maximum term of 20 years' imprisonment, a mother convicted of incest under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-11 (1971) could only receive a maximum term of 10 years. The court held that the classification here did not rest upon sex alone. Furthermore, because the social harm of father-daughter intercourse was greater than in other proscribed incestuous relationships, the classification was both rationally related to a legitimate governmental objective and was supported by compelling considerations. Therefore, the aggravated incest statute was not violative of either the United States or Illinois Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for aggravated incest, but reduced his minimum sentence to five years.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the administrator argued that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 91, para. 181 et seq. (1973) immunized the class of persons selling blood for transfusions from the burden of strict tort liability imposed upon all other merchants selling all other goods in Illinois and therefore violated the constitutional prohibition against special legislation. Upon review, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The granting of a statutory exemption to the distributors of human tissue for the purpose of injection, transfusion, and the like from the general rule that held merchants and manufacturers strictly liable in tort for defects in their products was not unreasonable or arbitrary. Therefore, the legislation was not violative of the constitutional proscription on special legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that he was denied a fair trial because he was denied a 12-man jury, by improper argument of the village's counsel, and by prosecution as a civil matter, under a village ordinance for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The court held that defendant had the right to a jury composed of 12 jurors. The court also held the village's attorney erred in referring to and commenting upon defendant's failure to take a breathalyzer test under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501(h) (1971). However, the court found that the village properly prosecuted defendant under the village ordinance. The court held in Illinois a person could be prosecuted for driving under the influence of an alcoholic beverage under a civil petty offense ordinance. Finally, the court held that there was insufficient credible evidence to support the verdict. The record showed considerable difference in the testimonies of the witnesses for each of the parties.

Defendant, as president and a representative of an Afro-American organization for black policemen had contributed some of the film used in the presentation. An attendant noticed that defendant had a gun in his waistband and had slurred speech. The attendant asked defendant and his party to wait until intermission to enter the studio because they were very late. Defendant proceeded to enter anyway and never advised anyone that he was a policeman. The attendant called the authorities to report that a patron had a weapon. Defendant and his friend were subsequently charged and convicted with disorderly conduct. The trial court denied defendant's motion for a new trial. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that the disorderly conduct ordinance was constitutional, that the evidence supported the jury's verdict, and that defendant had failed to show that the ordinance was enforced against him in a discriminatory manner based on his participation in the organization for Afro-American policemen.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mayor and members of the city council viewed the movie in question and then revoked defendant's license after the mayor determined that the motion pictures that defendant exhibited in his theatre were obscene. The city council affirmed the revocation. Ten days later defendant was charged with operating a movie theatre on three occasions without a valid license in violation of Ordinance No. 73-6. On appeal, defendant argued that the definition of obscenity contained in the ordinance failed to meet constitutional standards. The court reversed the conviction, holding that the licensing regulation was an obvious attempt to prevent defendant from showing all future films, whether obscene or not, by means of a license revocation predicated on an administrative determination that one obscene film had been shown. Under the rulings of the Supreme Court, there first had to be a judicial determination of whether the movie was in fact obscene. The ordinance did not provide for that, so it was a prior restraint in violation of the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The county board denied the petition for a special use permit and plaintiffs instituted an action for a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to their property. The trial court upheld the validity of the ordinance and plaintiffs appealed. The court declared the ordinance invalid. It explained that the denial of a special use permit had to bear a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare. The court noted that it was not reviewing the action of the county board with regard to evidence or facts that it had considered, but based its decision only on facts presented to the trial court. Thus, a witness's changed position at trial, approving the proposed use was controlling, not his prior testimony before the county board expressing disapproval. The court was further persuaded that an increase in local government costs for schools was not a legitimate basis for rejecting the permit.

Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 705-9 (1973) of the Juvenile Court Act, and appointed a guardian to consent to the adoption of her daughter. The State had petitioned the trial court for the appointment of a guardian.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The daughter was found to be dependent and was placed in the custody of the children and family services department. Later, the mother filed several petitions seeking to regain custody of her daughter, all of which were dismissed because the mother failed to appear. When the State filed its petition, the mother filed another petition to regain custody and again failed to appear at the evidentiary hearing. On appeal, the mother contended that the trial court erred in finding her unfit and terminating her parental rights because Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 4, para. 9.1-1(D)(b) (1973) of the Illinois Adoption Act was unconstitutional and no finding of neglect was made as required by &sect; 1(D)(1). In affirming the decision, the court stated that the mother's failure to raise the issue of the statute's unconstitutionality at trial precluded her from raising the issue for the first time on appeal. Further, the court found that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to show that the mother was unfit because she failed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest, concern, or responsibility as to her daughter's welfare. The court did not need to consider the other issue raised by the mother.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois), which entered a judgment of conviction against him for armed robbery after he filed a motion to withdraw his plea of not guilty and entered a plea of guilty to the charge. The trial court imposed a sentence of 4 to 9 years, as recommended by the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant entered his guilty plea, the trial court did not inform him of the possibility of periodic imprisonment because the State's attorney advised the trial court that the Unified Code of Corrections, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-5-3(d) had been amended. The trial court then proceeded on the assumption that incarceration was a mandatory disposition. The court held that the trial court's assumption that the amendment to the Code was effective at the time of defendant's sentencing was erroneous and that the statute as originally enacted was effective. Thus, the court had to determine if a reversal was required. In affirming the decision, the court held that pursuant to controlling case law, Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 402, which provided that a defendant be admonished as to the minimum sentence prescribed by law, did not require the trial judge to inform defendant as to the availability of periodic imprisonment. Defendant suffered no prejudice as a result of the admonition employed by the trial judge, and an examination of the record demonstrated that the guilty plea was voluntarily made and the sentence imposed was precisely that for which defendant bargained.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 156-13, 156-15 (1939).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner used half the space in his garage building as an office and for his own truck leasing business. The other half was leased out to tenants for operation of their own businesses, and they used their portions of the space for storage, maintenance, and repair of their own trucks and cars. No work upon any vehicle was done by the owner or his employees. The trial court found that the owner was guilty of operating a public garage without a license, but the court reversed, finding that the definition of &quot;public garage&quot; in Chicago, Ill., Mun. Code &sect;&sect; 156-13, 156-15 (1939), was not authorized by the grant of power contained in the enabling statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-42-8. (1973). The ordinance definition was far too broad and included many private garages. The court found that the central and indispensable test of a public garage was the existence of the right of public access and use thereof. However, access to the owner's garage was limited to the owner, his employees, and his tenants. The owner was not, as the City contended, attempting to disguise a public garage by adopting a private form.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board limited the prices the organizations could charge for their programs because it found that the high costs of admissions, parking, programs, and concession sales at race tracks in Illinois had been one of the causes of the decline in attendance at both thoroughbred and harness races. The organizations filed complaints for administrative review alleging that the action of the Board was illegal. The trial court reversed the portion of the Board's order limiting the prices of programs, and the court affirmed, concluding that the Horse Racing Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 8, paras. 37a - 37r (1971) gave the Board no power to establish the maximum prices it had attempted to establish in the instant case. Notwithstanding the broad discretion granted to the Board by the Act, the court found no legislative authorization to regulate the prices to be charged by its licensees. The absence from the Act of any standards, criteria, or procedure for determining such prices confirmed that the legislature had not intended to give the Board the power to make such determinations.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a writ of mandamus was appropriate even though there was no indication that any future meeting by the same parties were scheduled or contemplated. The court determined that defendants had standing to urge alleged constitutional defects in the Act because the statute could subject defendants to future criminal sanctions, but the court held that the exemptions of the statute did not create a classification which amounted to invidious discrimination. The court ruled that the statute was not patently arbitrary with no rational relationship to governmental interests.

The court determined from the provisions of the Illinois Fire Protection District Act that the district was required to give the city notice prior to obtaining a court order and held that the trial court properly vacated the order that had set aside the disconnect objected to in the district's petition. The court further determined that the wording of the Act required that the trial court was to determine the factors in considering the disconnect as of the date of the hearing and not when the petitions were filed and as a consequence all of the petitions were to be heard at the same time, since they were interrelated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer was killed in the line of duty, leaving his wife and two surviving children. The children were entitled to and did receive child annuity payments under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108 1/2, para. 5 (1967). The Board denied the petition to increase the children's annuity payments based on subsequent amendments to the Illinois Pension Code. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment upholding the Board's decision. The court held that under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108 1/2 para. 5-152, a child's annuity was fixed as of the date of the officer's death. The relevant amount of the children's annuity was determined by first determining that the wife survived the officer. Because the wife survived, the child's annuity was determined as long as the wife continued to survive and the children remained eligible for the annuity. The city could treat the survivors of police officers differently than the survivors of firemen or other municipal employees because of the inherent risks involved in the different types of work.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital needed the variation and special use to build a five-story addition on adjoining land and a parking garage across the street. The hospital claimed that the objectors lacked standing to maintain the action and that the variation and special use were properly allowed because it proved its need to expand in order to serve its patients and the public. The court affirmed the judgment reversing the board's decisions. The court held that the hospital's challenge to the objectors' standing came too late and that the objectors had standing under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-13-7 (1969). The court found that the needs of the hospital, which had a long-term lease on the original property, were relevant; but that both the hospital and the building's owner failed to prove lack of a reasonable return on the property as presently used; and that even if not-for-profit corporations did not have to meet the reasonable return test, the hospital failed to show that an annex built in conformity with the permissible 2.2 floor area would not meet its needs. The court also determined that the hospital failed to prove that the garage would provide the required number of parking spaces.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of the crime of publicly mutilating a flag of the United States in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/4, para. 6 (1969). The court affirmed the judgments. The Illinois Supreme Court denied leave to appeal. Defendants then appealed to the United States Supreme Court. The United States Supreme Court vacated the judgment, and the case was remanded to the court for further consideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its earlier opinion, the court applied the O'Brien analysis. Defendants argued that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 561/4, para 6 (1969) was unconstitutional as applied because the act of flag burning was protected symbolic speech within the First Amendment. They argued that burning a flag was a purely symbolic act that contained no non-speech elements. Therefore, they argued that the O'Brien analysis did not apply. On remand, the court disagreed. Defendants' argument failed to account for the view of the United States Supreme Court, expressed in O'Brien and reiterated in its Spence analysis, where the Supreme Court rejected the proposition that a limitless variety of conduct could be labeled &quot;speech&quot; whenever the person intended to express an idea. The record in the instant supported a valid governmental interest in the prevention of breaches of the peace. Here, an allegation of physical desecration was made. Also, the United States Supreme Court never rejected the breach of the peace rationale as support for flag desecration statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city adopted an ordinance that rezoned the plaintiffs' subject property from one that permitted commercial use to one that classified the subject property to strictly residential use.

Those third parties had relied on the original zoning classification and the plaintiffs never received actual notice of the change. The plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment to declare the ordinance invalid and unconstitutional, but the circuit court ruled in favor of the city and denied the plaintiffs' motion to vacate the judgment. The court reversed the declaration. The city alleged that they complied with the requirements of notice by publication of the proposed zoning change in the newspaper under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-13-14, and therefore satisfied due process requirements. The court held that such a statutory requirement was constitutionally insufficient because notice placed in a newspaper was not reasonably calculated to reach those who were to have been informed their rights were affected by the proposal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a conviction for aggravated incest, defendant was sentenced to probation. Before the probationary period was completed, defendant was charged with similar acts of aggravated incest.

In seeking review, defendant claimed that the conviction was unconstitutional and that the sentence was excessive because it punished defendant for the subsequent offenses. Upon review, the court held that defendant's constitutionality claim could not be reviewed on appeal from the probation revocation because defendant had failed to appeal the conviction. Likewise, the court held that defendant was barred from raising the constitutionality claim because defendant had failed to present the claim in the trial court. Finally, in reducing the sentence, the court held that the sentence did not merely reflect defendant's subsequent conduct as it reasonably bore upon defendant's potential for rehabilitation but instead, effectively punished defendant for the later offenses as well.</SPAN></P>

The claimant argued that the purpose of the legislation was to protect only the passenger, rather than the public, and that the statutory classification was not reasonable. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and upheld the constitutionality of the statute. The court noted the State's argument that the statute was designed to protect the public health and safety because a motorcycle was a delicately balanced vehicle, a flying object or insect could strike the passenger in the eye, and the passenger could thereby disturb the driver, cause a loss of control of the motorcycle, and endanger the operator, the passenger, and the public. The court further noted that , the burden was upon defendant to provide evidence to support his contention that the legislative classification was unreasonable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff licensee sought review of the judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which sustained the revocation of his liquor license by defendants, a city liquor commission and a state liquor commissioner. The trial court found Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 26.1-2,4,5 (1971) and Calumet City, Ill., Ordinance ch. 25 &sect; 25-008 constitutional and not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The revocation of the license was based upon a witness' testimony that he and a friend were asked by the licensee's two female employees to purchase drinks for them. The legislation was directed at solicitation by females rather than males in establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages. The classification reflected the legislature's judgment that solicitation of beverages was a greater problem with respect to female employes. In view of the broad power of the State to regulate the operations of liquor licensees, the court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 26.1-2,4,5 (1971) and Calumet City, Ill., Ordinance ch. 25 &sect; 25-008 were not violative of the equal protection clauses of the United States and Illinois constitutions. The record revealed that the licensee did not attempt to establish a relationship between the witness' and the employees at the hearing. The licensee did not allege that they were in fact related. Since the licensee was aware of this defense and had the opportunity to prove its existence, the court concluded that blood or marriage did not relate the employees and the witness to each other.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the city enacted an ordinance that prohibited nude dancing in connection with the sale of alcoholic beverages, the corporation continued to provide the entertainment along with the sale of alcoholic beverages. The city filed a complaint alleging that the corporation's activities violated the ordinance and that the city had no adequate remedy at law. The court affirmed the order granting a preliminary injunction against the corporation. The city was not required to allege facts constituting irreparable injury because a court of equity had the power to protect citizens from public wrongs and to protect the public health and welfare. The court rejected the corporation's argument that the preliminary injunction should not have been issued because it granted the ultimate relief sought. The injunction did not end the case because it could have been dissolved and the acts could have resumed. The granting of the injunction was a matter resting in the sound discretion of the court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress his confession and convicted him of murder, armed robbery, and unlawful use of a weapon.

Defendant also filed a motion to prevent a justice of the court from hearing his appeal. The court denied the motion as frivolous. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision, holding that defendant had not made a prima facie case of unconstitutional discrimination or statutory vagueness regarding qualifications for grand jurors. The court also ruled that there was no evidence that defendant's confession was involuntary because photos taken of him in jail did not reveal beatings allegedly inflicted by police. The court found further that with or without defendant's confession there was sufficient evidence to hold defendant accountable for his participation in the various crimes under Ill. Rev.

She further alleged that defendants, insurer and safety inspector, negligently performed safety inspections and thereby caused her injury. The trial court dismissed these counts on the ground that the Workmen's Compensation Act, Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 48, &sect; 138.5(a), barred common law negligence actions against these parties.

While being questioned at the jail, defendant was audio taped. At his trial, defendant moved to suppress the audio tape. The trial court granted the motion. The State sought review. On review, the court noted that Ill. Rev.

The court also noted that another requirement for admissibility of evidence obtained was a request by the State's attorney. The court found that, prior to the incident in question, the State's attorney had ordered that the audio-video equipment was to be used whenever anyone was questioned or tested at the county jail concerning a charge of driving while under the influence. Accordingly, the court held that because a valid request was made by the State's attorney and there was consent of one of the parties to the conversations and questioning, the audio tape was not made inadmissible by the eavesdropping statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of and sentenced for armed robbery and felonious unlawful use of weapons. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that it was inherently prejudicial to disclose defendant's prior burglary conviction to prove an element of the weapons charge at a joint trial of a separate primary offense with an enhanced penalty offense. The prior conviction had been disclosed by the reading of the indictment to the prospective jurors on voir dire and again by the State at the close of its case in chief. It was an abuse of discretion for the trial court not to sever the two charges for trial and new trials were required for both counts. The enhanced penalty offense under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 24-1(b) (1971) provided that a person convicted of a felony within five years of another felony would receive an increased sentence. Thus, the prosecution included the prior burglary conviction in the indictment to support the enhanced penalty of the weapons charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The gist of the taxpayer's complaint was that because the purposes and objectives of the real estate equalization statutes, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 611 et seq. (1971), were contrary to the Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance adopted by the Cook County on December 17, 1973, the equalization sections of the Revenue Act of 1939 could not lawfully and constitutionally be applied to Cook County for the taxes of the year 1974 and subsequent years. The classification ordinance divided real estate in the county into five classifications. On appeal, the court affirmed the order of the trial court. The taxpayer's conclusion that the application of a multiplier would result in an increase in assessments in Cook County was without foundation. No facts were alleged in the complaint to support the taxpayer's speculation as to the proposed action of the director. The taxpayer was simply complaining that due to the alleged unlawful acts of the director the assessments as equalized were in excess of that allowed by law. The taxpayer wanted a determination that the director had no authority to certify a multiplier. The taxpayer should have utilized the statutory remedy.</SPAN></P>

He sought review. The court affirmed defendant's conviction but vacated his sentence. It found that defendant failed to show that the State's use of peremptory challenges violated the Equal Protection Clause. An admonishment made by the trial court to a witness did not invade the province of the jury. Furthermore, the trial court properly instructed the jury on the admonishment and even if the remark was improper, when placed in the context of the entire trial, the remark did not substantially prejudice defendant's case. The evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction because even though the testimony was contradictory, the testimony of even one witness, when positive and credible, was sufficient to convict. The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant's application for probation. However, the court found that defendant's sentence was excessive under the circumstances and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 15-111 (1973). A police officer for the State testified that the rear tandem axle tires appeared to be deflated and the springs appeared to be bowed. The trial court stated that &sect; 15-112(a) of the Illinois Motor Vehicle Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 15-112(a) (1973), which allowed a police officer to stop and weigh a vehicle which he had reason to believe was overweight was overbroad and gave a police officer too much authority to stop a trucker based upon mere suspicion. The court reversed the trial court's decision. The court held that the action of a police officer who had reason to believe that the weight of a vehicle was unlawful in requiring the driver to stop and submit to a weighing of the vehicle did not constitute an arrest or an unlawful search.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The objectors also contended that Public Act 77-604, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, par. 11-6 (1971) was unconstitutional in that, while it allowed anyone &quot;who appears in support&quot; of such a petition to seek an administrative review, it did not grant such a review to those who opposed such a petition. In affirming the judgment of the trial court dismissing the administrative review count for want of jurisdiction and, on the declaratory judgment, holding the statute constitutional the court noted that although Public Act 77-604 by its language gave only supporters of a petition the right to review under the Administrative Review Act it did not follow that such a provision was unconstitutional. A denial of a petition effectively stopped all proceedings thereunder, and in effect it was thus a final judgment against the petitioners. However, if the petition was granted, there were further proceedings in which the objectors might yet prevail. Consequently, the provisions of Public Act 77-604 limiting review of the superintendent's order to those instances where that order denied the petition and terminated the proceedings did not unfairly discriminate as between objectors and petitioners.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and held that defendant offered substantial, unrebutted, and uncontroverted proof that he was a security guard within the security guard exemption. Section 24-2 placed the burden on defendant to produce a quantum of evidence sufficient to place the question of exemption in issue. An exemption was an affirmative defense, and once an affirmative defense was raised the burden was on the state to prove defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt as to that issue. Defendant's evidence was sufficient evidence to bring the security guard exemption into issue. The court held that the state failed to meet its burden of proof, and defendant fell within the statutory exemption.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Liquor Control Act (Act), the legislature made it legal for 19 and 20 year olds to purchase alcohol. However, the cities passed ordinances which limited alcohol sales to persons of at least 21 years of age. As a result, the Commission brought a declaratory judgment action, claiming the ordinances were unconstitutional. Following a verdict for the cities, the Commission sought review, and the court affirmed. The court held the cities' regulation of alcohol had been intimately related to the cities' police powers under Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6(a). Thus, the court held the ordinances had been valid exercises of the cities' authority as home-rule units. Moreover, because constitutional and statutory restrictions were absent, the court held the ordinances had not been superceded by the Act. Likewise, the court held the cities' authority had not been preempted by the state in light of the fact that the state had neither explicitly nor implicitly asserted exclusive authority over the minimum drinking age. Finally, the court held the ordinances had not deprived 19 and 20 year olds of equal protection because there had been a rational basis for the ordinances' enactment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which denied his petition for a writ of mandamus or post-conviction relief, in which he alleged that respondent department of corrections failed to credit his Illinois sentence with his time served in New York. He asked that the department be ordered to allow the Illinois sentence to run concurrently with the New York sentence as ordered by the circuit court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was extradited from New York where he was serving a sentence for forgery, convicted in Illinois of armed robbery, and sentenced to three concurrent terms. The Illinois court ordered that the terms were to be served concurrently with the New York sentence, but the department refused to give the inmate credit for his New York prison time. The circuit court denied him a writ of mandamus. On appeal, the department claimed that Illinois sentencing statutes, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. -- 7(m), 1 - 7(n) (1971), allowed Illinois sentences to run concurrently only with federal sentences because there was no exception for Illinois sentences to run concurrently with those of other states. The inmate argued that a law allowing concurrent sentences for federal crimes and not for other state crimes violated the Equal Protection Clause. However, the court noted that both parties missed the crucial issue, which was whether an administrative officer could refuse to obey a court order that he believed was invalid. The court held that an administrative officer was not entitled to decide which orders were valid and which were not; thus, the writ of mandamus should have been issued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the circuit court's judgment and remanded with directions to issue the writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

He argued that he was entrapped into selling the allegedly obscene materials, that the Illinois obscenity statute, Ill. Rev.

The court held that the trial court committed plain error in completely failing to instruct the jury regarding the geographical standard that they were to apply in their deliberations. The jury had to be instructed as to which geographical standard to apply. In Illinois, the standard was statewide. The jury was given unbridled discretion to impose any type of standard they desired as to the book in question from their own subjective feelings to a precise nationwide geographical standard. Defendant could not avail himself of the defense of entrapment because the testimony clearly indicated his predisposition to commit the crime charged. Para. 11-20 was consistent with the requirements established in Miller for State regulation of pornography.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. X, &sect; 1, and that the school board was required by referendum to furnish &quot;textbooks&quot; without charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the school board adopted a flat-rate fee schedule for fees to be paid by parents for materials that were provided to their children, the parent refused to pay the fee and filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment and for an injunction. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the parent on the issues of statutory authorization and its scope, but found the charging of fees was not unconstitutional, and the school board sought review. On appeal, the court held that under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, paras. 10-20.5, 10-20.8 (1973) a broad spectrum of implied incidental powers was to be inferred from the general power to adopt all necessary rules for the management and government of the schools. Based on this power, the court held that the school board did not lack statutory authorization for its charges because it had an implied power to purchase supplies for the students and pass on the cost to their parents on a mandatory basis. The court ruled that none of the disputed items were &quot;textbooks&quot; in its popularly understood meaning or commonly accepted dictionary interpretation, and therefore the cost of these items were properly included in the fee charged to the parent.</SPAN></P>

The park district brought a forcible entry and detainer action against the golf professionals for possession of the golf concession shops at the five public golf courses owned by the park district. The lower court found for the golf professionals. Upon appeal, the court reversed, holding that the defenses asserted by the golf professionals were not germane as required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch.57, para. 5. There was no factual dispute as to the existence and provisions of the contracts. The concession contracts made no reference to the employment as greenskeepers and therefore, the golf professional's employment as greenskeepers was not germane to the question of their right to possession of the pro shops, but was a separate contractual relationship.

Stat. ch. 106 3/4, para. 54 (1971), to require the alleged father to support the child whom she alleged was his daughter. The trial court dismissed the paternity action on the grounds that the mother's complaint did not occur within the time prescribed by the statute. On appeal, the court reversed the motion to dismiss and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that &sect; 4, by limiting the right of action for support of the illegitimate child to two years subsequent to birth, protected the putative father by invidious discrimination against a class of children and their mothers. There was no rational relationship between illegitimacy, as a classification, and protecting a putative father two years after the birth of the illegitimate child. Section 4 denied equal protection based upon arbitrary classification which operated irrationally upon children born out of wedlock and their mothers.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to the penitentiary for an indeterminate term with the minimum fixed at one year and the maximum at three years. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of accepting the plea, the trial court advised defendant of the minimum and maximum penitentiary sentences that could be imposed but did not mention the nonpenitentiary sentences of periodic imprisonment, probation, and conditional discharge that were available under the Illinois Unified Code of Corrections, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1001-1-1 et seq. (1973). On appeal, defendant contended that the failure to so advise violated Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 402(a)(2), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110A, para. 402(a)(2) (1973), which required that before accepting a guilty plea, a court had to in open court inform the defendant of and determine that he understood the minimum and maximum sentence prescribed by law. The court held that the admonishment given to defendant in the instant case was in substantial compliance with Rule 402(a)(2). As to defendant's contention that the trial court should not have given him a felony sentence because there was no proof that the value of the property taken in the underlying charge was of enough value to make that charge a felony, the court noted that a bail bond violation could occur even if the underlying charge was later declared invalid.</SPAN></P>

The customer appealed, arguing that the subpoena power vested in the department pursuant to Ill. Rev.

The court determined that the confession of judgment statute, Ill. Rev.

The court noted that the contract signed by the debtor was an adhesion contract, a factor militating against a voluntary waiver by a debtor, and that the debtor's affidavit stated that she was unaware of the confession clause and did not understand its meaning which, if true, meant that the debtor could not have intelligently and knowingly waived her right to pretrial notice.</SPAN></P>

Defendant presented an equal protection challenge tot he statute under which he was sentenced, but the court determined that the issue was waived because it was not presented to the trial court. The determined that the classification of prisoners who escape in regard to whether they were serving time in state prison or whether they were awaiting sentencing did not constitute an infringement of a constitutionally protected interest. The distinction between the two groups of people had some rational basis. The legislature might have determined that an individual was more likely to escape after conviction and sentencing; therefore, the harsher punishment for escape from state prison was justified as a needed deterrent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the ordinance for public intoxication was unconstitutional and that his arrest and search was therefore illegal. The court first noted that it could address the issue of the ordinance's constitutionality, although defendant had not raised it until his appeal. However, the court went on to say that it did not reach the constitutional issue. Even if the ordinance under which the arrest had been made was invalid, the arrest and search were not necessarily illegal. The issue was whether the arresting officer had reasonable cause to believe that the ordinance against public intoxication had been violated. The evidence showed that defendant was staggered, had slurred speech, had the smell of alcohol on his breath, and had tried to start his vehicle with the wrong set of keys. The court found that the police had probable cause for the arrest and for the search incident to defendant's arrest.</SPAN></P>

The court held that notice by publication of the time to file complaints with the Board of Appeals of Cook County pursuant to para. 596 did not violate due process of law. The court held that the publication as provided by para. 596 was reasonable and sufficient as the property owner was provided sufficient and adequate notice and opportunity for hearing before the Board of Appeals.

Stat. ch. 38, &sect; 12-2(a)(1), it clearly intended, in view of the existing armed violence statute, to make it possible to charge armed violence where there was an assault with a deadly weapon. According to the court, there was a clear legislative intent that the penalty for any aggravated assault with a deadly weapon would be enhanced and possibly punished under the armed violence provision. The court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's armed violence conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The particular points raised by defendant were that the trial court failed to determine that there was an adequate basis for the charge and that it erred in not advising defendant that there was a mandatory three-year parole term which was involved with any sentence for a Class 2 felony such as robbery under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-801(e) (1973). Defendant acknowledged that he read the indictment and that he understood the charge of robbery. He did not allege that the record would show a factual situation inconsistent with the crime charged if the trial court had elicited a more detailed factual basis, nor did he allege that he had pleaded to a crime he didn't commit. He was represented by counsel, and there was no disagreement with the outline of facts given by the prosecutor. Defendant received exactly the sentence he had bargained for. The court therefore found no basis for reversal for a failure to comply with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 402(c). It was considered to be too far-reaching to require that the trial courts admonish defendant as to the parole term, and the court noted defendant had not alleged that he would perhaps have pleaded &quot;not guilty&quot; had he been so admonished.</SPAN></P>

The trial court issued a writ of replevin and later granted summary judgment in favor the seller for possession of the paper cutter.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtor executed an installment negotiable promissory note when he purchased a car. The debtor paid more than 60 percent of the amount due, but defaulted and the car was repossessed. On review, the court reversed. The court found that, having taken the car without request, the bank could not assert that the debtor had no intention to voluntarily surrender it. The court determined that there was no evidence of any resistance by the debtor to the repossession of the car, and he had been given no opportunity voluntarily to surrender it, therefore there was no merit to the bank's contention as to the absence of a surrender. The court also found that, on the state of the record and as a matter of law, the car was in ordinary condition at the time of its repossession. The court thus determined that the conditions precedent to the required election of remedies under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121 1/2, para. 580 (1971) were proved to have been substantially complied with. The court held that the bank, by selling the car rather than returning it to the debtor, made the election to retain the goods and release the debtor from further obligation under the contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction, contending that (1) the statute setting forth the offense of reckless homicide was unconstitutional, and (2) the trial court erred in sentencing him under the extended-term provision of the Unified Code of Corrections. On review, the court rejected defendant's first contention, finding that subsequent to defendant's filing his appeal, the caselaw relied upon by defendant was reversed. Accordingly, the court held that the reckless homicide statute did not violate the doctrine of equal protection nor contain an unauthorized delegation of legislative authority. The court found no error in sentencing defendant under the extended term provisions, given defendant's criminal history. The court however, did note that commitment for diagnostic study was a condition precedent to sentencing under the extended term provision and that failure to follow such procedure required the sentence to be vacated and the cause remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued that &sect; 41 of the Environmental Protection Act, (Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 1041 (1971)), was unconstitutional and that requiring it to comply with the order of the board imposed an arbitrary and unreasonable hardship. The court disagreed on both counts and affirmed the board's order. The court held that the act was not unconstitutional under the doctrine of separation of powers and that the terms &quot;contaminant&quot; and &quot;air pollution&quot; were not so vague as to confer arbitrary power upon the board. The court also found no merit in the contention that &sect; 41 of the act was unconstitutional in that it purported to amend section 5 of the Administrative Review Act, (Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 268 (1971)), without compliance with the constitutional mandate that the amended section be inserted at length in the new act. The Administrative Review Act expressly provided that it was applicable to and governed every action to review judicially a final decision of any administrative agency where the act creating the agency or conferring power on it by express reference adopted the provisions of the Administrative Review Act, which the Environmental Protection Act did.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court stated that plaintiff did not allege facts showing anything more than administrative insensitivity and bureaucratic indifference to his problems. The court affirmed the judgment because a party's act in signing a contract remained voluntary, as long as he had ample time for inquiry, examination, and reflection, and the party benefiting was not responsible for the circumstances creating the necessity. The fact that the alternatives were unattractive did not render the agreement a coerced one. The court noted that, even if it were conceded that the state wrongfully pressured plaintiff into buying insurance, plaintiff stated no cause of action against the insurer which benefitted from his necessity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospitals argued that they did not comply with the subpoenas because they were exempt from the provisions of the Fair Employment Practices Act, Ill.

The court disagreed, finding that the hospitals were owned by a charitable organization. The corporation which owned the hospitals neither issued stock nor paid out dividends nor did it have the power to do so. The corporate purposes included the raising of funds, loans and gifts for the use and benefit of the medical corporation which operated the hospitals. All the funds raised for and profits accrued from the hospitals were applied to the operation of the hospitals. No profits accrued to the private benefit of any individual or organization. Finally, the hospitals admitted a number of free patients who were unable to pay. The corporation and its hospitals were charitable institutions within the meaning of section 2(d). The court also held that a religious order owned and operated the hospitals, so they were exempt under the Act.</SPAN></P>

Defendants alleged that the Act was unconstitutional, or in the alternative if the Act was constitutional, their guilt was not established beyond a reasonable doubt, and that their jury waiver was not voluntarily given.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were arrested for unlawful delivery of more than 500 grams of a substance containing cannabis. After arraignment, defendants filed a motion for discovery, which was granted, by the trial court. The State filed a motion for continuance of the discovery order, which was never ruled on by the trial court. The State failed to answer defendant's discovery request until seven days before trial. Defense counsel's request for a continuance was denied, and defendants then offered to waive their right to a jury trial. The court reversed. Defendants' contention that the Act was indefinite, vague, and uncertain was without merit. The Act sufficiently stated what was or was not meant by the term cannabis, and provided for a definite penalty. There was sufficient testimony to establish defendants' guilt. However, the court held that defendants' jury waiver was involuntarily given. The State failed to comply with the discovery order until right before trial, defense counsel could not be prepared due to the volume of discovery, and defendants were put in the untenable position of choosing between a jury trial and a bench trial when defense counsel would be better prepared.</SPAN></P>

The Attorney General filed a petition for appeal to the circuit court, which was allowed, and the judgment was affirmed. The Attorney General then appealed to the Supreme Court of Illinois, which transferred the case to the court. The court dismissed the appeal. Under &sect; 11 of the Illinois Inheritance Tax Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 385 (1973), Illinois inheritance tax was imposed on the clear market value of the decedent's property as set on the date of death. The court agreed with the executrix that the Attorney General had not preserved the issue of a reduction on the state estate tax filing. The court found, however, that &sect; 11 was unconstitutional because its appeal procedures were in direct conflict with the Supreme Court Rules. The purported appeal to the circuit court was a nullity and the appeal from that ruling was dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physicians held limited medical licenses entitling them to practice medicine in designated state hospitals. After the passage of an amendment to the Medical Practice Act restricting limited licenses to one year, the physicians were directed to take and pass an academic medical exam or lose their employment and civil service status. The physicians argued that it was unclear under Section 13a (Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 91, para. 14a (1973)) of the Medical Practice Act whether a license would issue if a physician passed an exam or merely submitted proof that he was pursuing study at a medical school. The court held that as &sect; 13a of the Act was susceptible of more than one interpretation it was unconstitutionally vague and denied due process. As the physicians had passed examinations and had received promotions and increases in wages pursuant to the provisions of the Illinois Personnel Code, they were entitled to the protection of the civil service laws and were not required to take an examination to maintain employment. Finally, the court held that the statute applied only prospectively; to apply it to the physicians constituted an unconstitutional abridgment of a vested property right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of disorderly conduct. He contended that he was not proved guilty of violating the statute beyond a reasonable doubt. The court agreed, and it reversed the conviction. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 26-1(a)(1) (1961) stated that a person committed disorderly conduct when he knowingly did any act in such unreasonable manner as to alarm or disturb another and to provoke a breach of the peace. The court examined the record in this case. Defendant, while working under the supervision of a police officer, felt he was being treated unfairly. He complained and used a few profanities to express his displeasure. The complaint was made to the officer outside the immediate presence of others. The court found that the words spoken by defendant were not of the nature to evoke a violent response, especially from a police officer presumably trained to preserve the public order. The court also found that defendant displayed no physical conduct threatening a breach of peace. Thus, the state failed to prove the elements of disorderly conduct as required by the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An undercover agent contacted a seller for a controlled buy of amphetamine tablets. The seller was observed entering defendant's home and returning with the tablets. Later, police entered defendant's home, discovering the seller, the money, and traces of fluorescent powder on defendant's hand from the powder-dusted currency. The court held that under the facts and circumstances in the case, the arresting officers had reasonable cause to place the defendant under arrest and the right to make an examination of his hands to ascertain whether he in fact handled the bills dusted with fluorescent powder. The seized tablets were admissible evidence as the search was conducted within an area within the immediate control of the defendant during a valid arrest involving narcotics. The court found ample testimony in the record to sustain defendant's conviction. No inference of commingling of the amphetamine was inferable from the criminalist's testimony. The court rejected defendant's final contentions that his conviction for aiding in the sale of a controlled substance was not based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt and that the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village enacted Village of Worth, Ill., Ordinance No. 71-5 (June 22, 1971), created permit requirements and regulations for the establishment and operation of sanitary landfills and other waste disposal facilities located within the village's municipal boundaries. The owner's complaint alleged that the Environmental Protection Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 1001-1051 (1971), preempted the field of regulation of sanitary landfills. In affirming the trial court's judgment enjoining the village from attempting to enforce its ordinance against the owner, the court held that the legislature intentionally omitted from the Environmental Protection Act any reservation of authority empowering the village to enact coincidental ordinances licensing or regulating sanitary landfills. A condition in the owner's permit that restated an Illinois Department of Public Health rule enacted under previous legislation did not operate to validate or ratify the ordinance. The ordinance was void as an attempted trespass into a field previously preempted by the Illinois General Assembly.</SPAN></P>

Under the circumstances, the sentence was not excessive because defendant kept the complaining witness under his control with a knife for a period of almost 2 hours, during which he committed all of the most degrading sexual offenses that were capable of being committed by a male against a female.

Stat. ch. 120, para. 507 (1969) provided for a use tax upon the lessee of previously exempt property. The county assessor issued assessment notices totaling millions of dollars.

The amended taxing statute was declared unconstitutional but the trial court allowed the county to collect the taxes during the pending appeal to be segregated and retained in a special fund. The attorneys who successfully represented the taxpayers sought 25 percent of the amount of the segregated funds and the taxpayers objected, claiming that they had paid into the fund for the tax and contested the attorneys fees requested. Upon appeal, the court affirmed the 15 percent of the amount of the segregated fund as an equitable fee. The court concluded that the fund came into being through the efforts of the attorneys and that it was beneficial to the taxpayers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business sought to enjoin the county from interfering in its operation, which featured nude dancing as entertainment, as well as a declaration that part of the ordinance was unconstitutional. It sought to require issuance of a local liquor license by writ of mandamus. The trial court initially granted the business' request for a temporary injunction but, after a subsequent hearing, vacated that order, finding that it had never been issued a local liquor license and was, therefore, in violation of those sections of the ordinance requiring a license. Ultimately, the trial court dismissed all the counts, and the business appealed. The court held that the challenged provisions of the ordinance were valid. The court concluded the trial court properly dismissed all the counts. The business did not sustain the burden for the right to the writ of mandamus. Also, it did not have a license to operate and could not require one be issued and there was no basis for injunctive relief. The court further found that the business was bound to pursue its remedies under the Administrative Review Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 265 (1973), because it had failed at exhausting those remedies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, corporation and lock manufacturer, appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County, which declared that Chicago, Ill., Mun. Code ch. 66, &sect; 5.11, an ordinance prohibiting coin locks on public bathroom facilities, was constitutional in all respects. Defendant city challenged the trial court's finding that plaintiffs were entitled to compensation for the loss of their investment and impairment of their contractual rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 5.11 banned pay toilets in municipal buildings and buildings open to serve the public. Before &sect; 5.11 was passed, most of the toilets in the corporation's bus terminal had coin locks on the stall doors. The lock manufacturer provided coin locks. Plaintiffs claimed &sect; 5.11 was not a permissible or reasonable exercise of the city's authority. The city argued that &sect; 5.11 did not result in the taking of property without due process of law. The court affirmed the declaration that &sect; 5.11 was constitutional because it was a valid, reasonable exercise of the city's power to regulate public health, Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect;6(a) and Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-20-5 (1973), and of its police power, Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 24, para. 11-1-1 (1973). The court reversed the compensation award because Chicago, Ill., Mun. Code ch. 66, &sect; 5.11 was a valid exercise of the city's police power and plaintiffs' property was not totally destroyed or rendered useless for all reasonable purposes. The court held that plaintiffs failed to show that &sect; 5.11 was arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable; that no permissible interpretation justified its adoption; or that it did not promote the general welfare.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners sought to build a residence on their lot, which had a 35-foot frontage in an area wherein the required frontage was 40 feet pursuant to Village of Skokie, Ill., Amended Zoning Ordinance, art.

The landowners had previously secured a variance for the lot for a different project. The board denied the variance, finding that the landowners' plight was not unique and that their hardship was created by their own doing. The trial court affirmed. Affirming, the court held that, as the landowners knew of the zoning restrictions applicable to their undersized lot, they retained that lot at their own risk and any financial disadvantage was self-imposed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board of Trustees had the power to levy taxes pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 103-1. The County Treasurer collected such taxes. The county board resolved that the college district be charged a fee that approximated the cost of levying and collecting the taxes. The county board directed the County Treasurer to deduct the fee before paying over to the district the taxes collected for it. The Board of Trustees commenced an action that alleged that the County Treasurer wrongfully retained a certain sum from the Board of Trustees. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the Board of Trustees. The court found that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 53, para. 39, which permitted a county collector of taxes to take a percentage commission from the taxes he collected as remuneration for his services, was based on an older version of the Illinois Constitution. The court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 53, para. 39 was in conflict with Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 9(a) (1970), which precluded payment of officers from fees collected. Therefore, the court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 53, para. 39 was unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois), which convicted him on a four count indictment of resisting a police officer, driving with a valid driver's license, and other related offenses. The primary issue was whether the grand jury that indicted defendant and the petit jury that convicted defendant were illegal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for driving without a valid license was reversed because the prosecution admitted that the state had revoked defendant's license without a hearing, which denied him due process. But the court also found no conflict of interest where the prosecutor in the current case represented defendant several years earlier. But the real issue was that defendant claimed that both the grand jury and the petit jury in his case were illegal. In July 1971, the XXVI Amendment was ratified, making it legal for 18-year olds to vote. Defendant's criminal case, from indictment to conviction, went from January 1972 to March 1972. In October 1973, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 78, para. 2 and 9 (1971) were both modified to reduce the minimum age for grand and petit jurors from 21 to 18-years of age, and to required all jurors to be &quot;eligible voters.&quot; Defendant argued that this made both his grand and petit juries unconstitutional, as they had no 18 to 21-year old members. The court held that the law in effect at the time of defendant's criminal proceeding permitted but did not mandate that 18 to 21-year olds be used as jurors, and that defendant's juries were not per se illegal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed in part and affirmed in part the judgment of the trial court. The court reversed defendant's conviction for driving without a license but affirmed all other counts of which he was convicted. The case was remanded to the trial court for the issuance of an amended mittimus in accordance with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) denied plaintiff business owners' motion for a temporary injunction restraining defendants, city and its superintendent of police, from interfering with the operation of their business and granted the city's motion for an order forbidding them from conducting their business within the city's limits. The business owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business owners owned a club, which provided male customers with sexual massages given by female employees. After the club had been raided many times by police and arrests made for prostitution, the owners filed an action against the city for an injunction prohibiting the city from interfering with its business. The city filed a cross bill, alleging that the owners were operating a massage parlor without a license, violating the prostitution laws, and that the raids and arrests were a proper exercise of its duty to protect the public health and welfare and community morals. The city also filed a motion for an order prohibiting the business owners from conducting their business anywhere within the city's limits. The trial court ruled in favor of the city on both motions. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that it was within the city's police powers to regulate the operation of the illegal parlor. Further, the court found that the trial court had the equitable authority to stop the business owners from conducting business at that site because their business constituted a public nuisance, however, the order should have been modified to include only the offending site.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the orders denying the business owners' motion for a preliminary injunction and granting the city's motion for an order prohibiting the business owners from conducting business. However, the court remanded the case for the trial court to modify its order prohibiting the business owners from conducting business anywhere in the city to an order prohibiting them from doing business in the offending location.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the charges arose from the same transaction and imposed sentences of 10 to 15 years for the robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants allegedly robbed the victims at gunpoint in their home; however, defense witnesses claimed that one victim was assisting in the planning of a robbery and that the victim started acting crazy. Defendants contended that guilt was not established beyond a reasonable doubt and that their sentences were excessive. The court found that it was the function of the jury to weigh the testimony, to judge credibility, and to determine factual matters. The court did not find the evidence improbable or unsatisfactory to establish a reasonable doubt. The court further found that the sentences were not excessive. Although the trial judge made a verbal misnomer as to the charge of aggravated assault, there was no error because the offenses were merged for sentencing and the sentence was imposed on the robbery charge. Further, there was no affirmative indication that a stricken burglary charge or a possession offense that was later found to be unconstitutional affected the sentence. One defendant was on probation for a weapons conviction and the other defendant showed prior convictions for violent crimes. Therefore, substantial admissible evidence supported the sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the statute was unconstitutional in that it violated Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13 because it applied only to incorporated cities, villages, and towns and having this limited application, it also violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The court disagreed. Because defendant challenged the constitutional validity of the statute under which he was convicted and sentenced, his objection was not waived by failure to present it at trial. Nevertheless, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, par. 24--1(a)(10) was valid. Its object was to limit the availability of firearms in the more populated areas. Pursuant to its police powers, the state had a valid interest in controlling crime, and the limitations on the right to possess guns fulfilled a valid state purpose in controlling their use. Likewise, the distinction in the statute between incorporated and unincorporated areas appeared to be a rational one. Absent the special scrutiny for suspect classifications or infringements of fundamental constitutional rights, the standards under the Equal Protection Clause and those under Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13 were practically identical.</SPAN></P>

The inmate contended that the trial court lacked jurisdiction and that the governing statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108, &sect; 112 (1971) (repealed 1973), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Just prior to the inmate's discharge, a petition was filed alleging that he was a sexually dangerous person and should be kept in the custody of the Department of Corrections until such time as his condition had subsided. The inmate was retained. Following a hearing, the trial court found him to be sexually dangerous and remanded him to custody pursuant to &sect; 112. The court affirmed. The fact that the inmate was retained on the day of his scheduled discharge past the usual time for release did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction of the petition. There was no showing of a requirement to release at any certain time. The differences in treatment under &sect; 112 of classes of inmates convicted of sex crimes had a rational medical basis: the distinction was between inmates who could benefit from a mental health program and those who could not. Moreover, there appeared to be no significant difference in the treatments accorded to inmates in any of the four classes under &sect; 112. As to the equal protection claim, there was no distinction unrelated to the object of &sect; 112 in the treatment accorded to those, like the inmate, who were in the fourth class of sexually dangerous inmates.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An informant was released from jail to work with officers as a paid informant. Two officers listened to a conversation between the informant and defendant during which defendant agreed to sell a $ 25 bag of heroin. The officers outfitted the informant with an electronic eavesdropping device and followed the informant to defendant's house where defendant gave the informant a foil-wrapped package containing heroin. Defendant was convicted of both possession and the sale of heroin. The court reversed the conviction for possession and held that Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 (1970), to whatever extent it might have created a new right, did not apply to events that occurred prior to its effective date. Thus, &sect; 6 was not applicable. Defendant's constitutional right to privacy was not violated because there was no search and seizure. Approval by an assistant state attorney coupled with the consent of the informant fully complied with the conditions of an exception to the eavesdropping statute. Further, both counts of the indictment were based upon a single act of defendant and thus, because possession of heroin was a lesser-included offense of selling heroin, there could be only one sentence.</SPAN></P>

Zatz, 13 Ill. App. 3d 322, 300 N.E.2d 16, and found no error in the failure of the trial judge to admonish defendant as to the possibility of consecutive sentences where a consecutive sentence was not imposed. Defendant was not required to be informed of probation and conditional discharge before his guilty plea to armed robbery was accepted because probation was not available as a sentencing option on a conviction for armed robbery. The court did find that the mandatory parole term imposed by Unified Code of Corrections &sect; 3-3-9 entailed a direct consequence of the guilty plea about which defendant had to be admonished. The court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 1005-8-1(e), 1003-3-9(a)(3)(i) (1973) were unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff tavern owners appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which found in favor of defendants, a city clerk and a board of elections commissioners, by denying the owners' motion to amend their complaint in an action to enjoin the filing of an election report under the Liquor Control Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 42, para. 182 (1971). The owners claimed that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 46 (1971) was misapplied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A local option election was conducted in the precinct of a ward in a city where the owners ran their businesses. The election resulted in the adoption of a proposition prohibiting the purchase of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises. The owners sought to enjoin the filing of the report of the election. The clerk and the board filed a motion to strike and dismiss, and the trial court held a hearing on the motion. Over objections at the hearing, the owners raised constitutional challenges not raised in their complaint. The trial court ruled that the matter was not raised in the complaint, it denied the owners' motion to amend under para. 46, and it entered judgment in favor of the clerk and the board. The owners appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying leave to amend. The basis of the request was vague and was not even remotely related to the issues that the owners placed before the trial court in the complaint. The owners failed to submit a proposed amendment to the trial court, so there did not exist sufficient reasons or facts to require the trial court to grant the motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A petition was filed requesting the call of an election to establish a Community Unit School District. After a hearing, the regional superintendent granted the petition, which was approved by the state superintendent. The court affirmed the dismissal of the action, holding that the version of &sect; 11-6 of the School Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 11-6 (1971), in effect at the time did not provide for administrative review from an order granting a petition. Section 11-6 only permitted appeal of a decision denying a petition. An amendment to the statute precluded review by writ of certiorari. The denial of review or appeal did not deny plaintiffs due process because the procedures for establishing district school boundaries were within the exclusive prerogative of the legislature, and legislative processes were not subject to due process rights such as judicial or adjudicative functions were. The court held that there was no constitutional right to appeal from administrative proceedings and the right of appeal from such proceedings was not necessarily essential to due process. The action for a declaratory judgment was premature because the election had not yet been held.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 122, para. 24-11 (1973) was not given. On petition for judicial review, the court reversed. It agreed that the employee was a tenured teacher because he had served two consecutive school terms without the para. 24-11 notice of an extension. However, because the remediable defects were longstanding and the employee had refused or failed to remedy them, written notice of such defects under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 24-12 (1973) was not required before action could be initiated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant gas station operator sought review of a decision from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which entered a decree that declared Village of Alsip, Ill., Ordinance No. 267, as amended by Village of Alsip, Ill., Ordinance No. 536 passed by appellees, a village, its mayor, and the village board of trustees, constitutionally valid and dismissed the operator's petition for a declaratory judgment and injunction against enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator objected to Ordinance No. 536 because it restricted the hours of operation of his business, which he kept open 24 hours a day. The regulation was passed because late night gas stations had high crime rates. The trial court sustained the ordinance. On appeal, the operator contended that the ordinance was discriminatory, that it was void because it exceeded the village's police power, and that the alleged crime problem was due to inadequate police protection. The court affirmed because the authority conferred by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11--8--4, 11--42--8 (1971) included the regulation of gasoline stations if the regulation was reasonably related to public safety, health, welfare, or to the prevention of public nuisances. The court noted the testimony that late night businesses such as gasoline stations were frequent crime sites. Based on that evidence, the court concluded that there was no error in the trial court's decision. Accordingly, the closing regulation was justified because it was reasonably related to the deterrence of crime and criminal activity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, holders of a life estate and a remainder interest in a tree farm and an owner of another farm, sought judicial review of defendant county highway superintendent's final decision to vacate a section of a county road that ran within two miles of their properties. The Circuit Court of Gallatin County dismissed the complaint on the ground that plaintiffs lacked the legal capacity to sue under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121, para. 6-315a (1971).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At a highway commissioner's hearing on the closure, the tree farm plaintiffs alleged that the closure would totally eliminate access to their tract. The farm owner testified that the closure would not adversely affect her and did not object to it. Plaintiffs contended, in part, that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121, paras. 6-312, 313, and 315a (1971), which limited appeals from road-vacation orders to certain qualified petitioners, violated Ill. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2, 12, and 15 and the United States Constitution. Affirming the judgment, the court found that plaintiffs did not fall within the class of persons eligible to seek judicial review under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121, para. 6-315a (1971) because the farm owner was not adversely affected by and did not object to the closure. The court rejected plaintiffs' federal claim because it was not raised below. The court held that para. 6-315a was not contrary to the state constitution because the legislature had the power to decide if and how statutory proceedings should be reviewed, a court could only obtain jurisdiction in the manner prescribed by statute, and there was no constitutional right to judicial review of administrative adjudications.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's case-in-chief showed that two vehicles were involved, with the identification number of the stolen truck being altered to conform to the identification number of a wrecked Ford truck obtained by defendant in Indiana.

No. 13.21 because the State had been attempting to prove the charge of receiving stolen property, and not the charge of theft. The court found that defendant's premise was false, as the instruction properly allowed the inference that theft was the cause of defendant's exclusive possession of the recently stolen truck. The court further found that the expert testimony of a police officer and an agent of the National Automobile Theft Bureau as to the automobile identification numbers was admissible where their opinions were based on personal knowledge and examination of the vehicles and were qualified by their years of study and experience. Although the court affirmed the conviction, it modified defendant's sentence because the minimum sentence should not have exceeded one-third of the maximum sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the trial, defendant presented an alibi as a defense. In rebuttal, the State introduced the testimony of two police officers claiming to have seen defendant elsewhere than where the alibi witnesses placed him at the time of the crime. Defendant's counsel objected to the testimony of the two officers because he was given any notice of the State's intention to call such witnesses. He was overruled and the police officers testified, over a strenuous objection and motion for mistrial by defendant's counsel. On appeal, defendant contended the defense gave the State the information necessary to comply with Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 114-14 (1971), so the State did not have a right to introduce the rebuttal witnesses without first giving the defense notice. The court agreed that the State should have been required to disclose information concerning the witnesses it intended to call to rebut the alibi before the witnesses testified. Because of the failure of the State to inform the defense of the names of the rebuttal witnesses as soon as the intent to call each of them was determined, there was a denial of reciprocal discovery rights to the prejudice of defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a police commissioner and a motor vehicle licensing commissioner, appealed a Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) judgment, which declared unconstitutional the &quot;Taxicabs-bulletproof shields&quot; statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 12-605 (1972 Supp.), for being unconstitutionally vague. Defendants also challenged the permanent injunction as to enforcing the statute as to plaintiffs, who were taxicab owners and operators.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The &quot;bulletproof shield&quot; statute had been enacted as a means of eliminating armed assaults on taxicab drivers. In challenging the trial court's ruling that the statute was too vague and indefinite, defendants contended that the trial court ignored the intent of the legislature as well as the special meaning which the term &quot;bulletproof shield&quot; had acquired within the taxicab industry. The court rejected all of defendants' assignments of error and affirmed. The statute at issue was a penal law; therefore, its essential elements had to be so clearly expressed that the ordinary person could intelligently choose in advance the lawful course to pursue. Contrary to defendants' contention, &quot;bulletproof shield&quot; was too indefinite and was susceptible of too many interpretations to form the basis of criminal liability. There was sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that no one standard defining &quot;bulletproof shield&quot; existed within the glass or related industries. Although the obvious intent of the legislature was to protect taxicab drivers, the infirmity in the statute's language outweighed that interest. Therefore, the statute was properly declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 1009(a) (1971), by causing air pollution in the form of odor contaminants either alone or in combination with other sources, and fining the company.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company's plant was located next to another chemical-producing facility, both situated across a highway and a few hundred yards away from a residential area. Residents complained of odors coming from the plants but witnesses could not testify as to which plant produced the odors; both companies were fined $ 10,000 each and ordered to achieve abatement. On review, the court found that the words used in &sect; 3 of the Act regarding unreasonable interference with the enjoyment of life or property were to be read in conjunctive sense and that &sect; 33(c) of the Act required specific findings by the Board. The court examined all sections of the Act to determine whether the evidence supported the Board's conclusions and whether the remedial portions of the Board's order were supported by the findings. The court found that witnesses for the Board did not detect any odor coming from the company's plant, that the company's manager admitted that there were some system breakdowns about three times a year which could cause odors, and that, in the absence of evidence about the cause and source of emissions, the Board's order could not be sustained.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 108 1/2, par. 5-212 (1965) in computing the pensions of any policeman who had served in the armed forces after he had been placed on the civil service eligible list but before he had been certified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both Illinois Const. art IV, &sect;&sect; 19 and 20 (1870) and the revised Ill. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1 (1970) barred use of public funds except for public purposes. The taxpayers argued that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108 1/2, para. 5-212 (1965) improperly provided compensation to a class of individuals before they had rendered service. That class consisted of individuals who had qualified to become police officers, but who entered the armed services before they were certified. Under &sect; 5-212, an officer could elect to pay into the pension fund for the time he was in military service. The court found that this option was constitutionally valid. There were other sections in the Pension Code which gave credit for service rendered before the employee became a participant. The legislature was vested with large discretion in determining what was for the public good. The act had the practical effect of attracting qualified applicants and encouraged men to re-enter the department at the completion of their military service. The court further found that the act did not constitute a special or local law by applying it to only those cities with a set minimum population.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision finding the law to be constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants claimed that there was a variance between the indictment of codefendant and the findings of the trial judge, that codefendant was denied a hearing in mitigation, that the trial judge abdicated his discretion in sentencing defendant, and that Ill.

The court affirmed both convictions, but it remanded codefendant's case for a correction to show that he was guilty of an attempt to contribute to the delinquency of a child. The court found that the trial court did not err when it believed the victim's testimony rather than that of defendant or codefendant or their alibi witnesses. The trial court did not err in finding codefendant guilty of sexual acts even though there was no penetration of the victim. Moreover, the court concluded codefendant was guilty of a lesser-included offense of the crime charged, so any the variance between the indictment and the findings of the trial court was not fatal. Defendant was not entitled to a hearing in mitigation, and the sentence imposed was valid under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, &sect; 11-1(c), which was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The shotgun was found under an abandoned car. At trial, the victim identified defendant as his assailant. On appeal, the court concluded that the evidence supporting the jury's verdict was not improbable, unconvincing, or contrary to human experience. The court determined that the victim's testimony that he saw defendant fire the shot that hit him from around the corner was not inherently improbable. The court found that, although the evidence did not unequivocally show that the victim's wounds were caused by the shotgun, the evidence also did not show that the wounds could not have been caused by the shotgun. The court rejected defendant's argument that he could not have shot the victim and been at the place where he was arrested based on the time and the distance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sergeant was advised that he would be retired on his 63rd birthday after 17 years of service; he applied for an extension of employment, as provided by article VIII of the Board's rules and regulations, but it was denied. He claimed that he was in excellent health and was a supervisor engaged in teaching at the academy. The circuit court ruled that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 125, paras. 56, 58, 62 (1971), allowed the Board to promulgate such rules and dismissed his complaint. On review, the court found that the Board exercised purely statutory powers that were legally conferred by express provision of law, that the legislative intent showed that the Board was to remove officers from service only for cause and after observing procedural protections, and that age alone was not just cause for removal from protected merit employment. The court reversed and ruled that the Board's rule was beyond its power, that para. 56 assured officers tenure during good behavior and that compulsory retirement ran counter to that principle, and noted that in other statutes concerning compulsory retirement of police and fire fighters, the word &quot;compulsory&quot; appeared in the statutes' caption.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the evidence against entrapment was not so clear and convincing that it could be said as a matter of law that there was no entrapment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that, after a bench trial, found him guilty of involuntary manslaughter under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-3 (1969) and admitted him to probation for 5 years on condition that the first year be spent in the House of Correction under the Work Release Program pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 123-7 (1971).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for involuntary manslaughter. After a bench trial, he was found guilty. Defendant appealed and the court held that the record disclosed that there was ample evidence to support the finding of guilt of involuntary manslaughter. The scene presented was one in which it was incumbent upon a person driving at that time and location to exercise extra care to avoid people crossing the street and automobiles which might be driving out from the gasoline station and parking area. Also, the flashing lights in connection with road repair should have warned any reasonable driver to use a great degree of caution. The necessary conclusion was that defendant was driving recklessly at an unreasonable rate of speed; that he was somewhat under the influence of alcohol; and that he executed a reckless maneuver in passing the other automobile to the right. The conclusion was established by the testimony of the witnesses as well as by undisputed physical facts. The court found that the State was entitled to correct the false impression given by defendant's direct examination regarding his alleged lack of previous accidents and speeding violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment of conviction and imposition of probation for five years. The cause was remanded with directions to consider whether or not defendant would be required to spend time on periodic imprisonment and, if so, the extent and conditions of that imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff estate administrator sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which found in favor of defendant savings and loan association in his action against the association to recover the money in a certificated of deposit purchased by the decedent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator, who was also the decedent's husband, argued that he and the decedent purchased a certificate of deposit from the association; that they signed a signature card providing that in the event of the decedent's death, the deposit and accrued interest were to go to him; that the decedent was the holder on the account and that she died; that by reason of the association's gross negligence the signature card was lost; and that subsequent to the decedent's death he demanded payment and the association willfully refused to pay him. On appeal the administrator argued, inter alia, that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 32, para. 770(c) (1973) was unconstitutional. Upon review, the court held that the trial court properly granted judgment in favor of the association. Paragraph 770(c) indicated one type of account that savings and loan associations were able to offer to the public. The provision was not incongruous or unrelated to laws relating to savings and loan associations. In applying equally to all savings and loan associations in Illinois, paragraph 770(c) embraced all who occupied a similar position, and was a constitutionally permissible general law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the judgment of the trial court, and held that the administrator's argument that the controlling statute was unconstitutional was without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction for attempted armed robbery on the ground that the warrantless arrest was illegal. He also argued that the lineup in which he was identified was unconstitutionally suggestive and that the trial court therefore erred when it admitted into evidence lineup identification testimony and an in-court identification of defendant as it was a result of the invalid lineup in which he was made to wear clothing fitting the description of clothing worn by one of the bank robbers. The court affirmed the warrantless arrest but vacated the conviction for attempted armed robbery, concluding that: (1) the police were in possession of sufficient facts to have had a reasonable belief that a crime was committed and that defendant was one of the offenders; however (2) the trial judge should have determined whether the lineup itself was unconstitutionally suggestive. On rehearing, the trial court was ordered to grant defendant a new trial if it was found that the identification testimony was not independent of the improper police station confrontation; or to reinstate the conviction if the testimony of such witnesses was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant was not denied equal protection of the laws. The court also held that although the trial court did not admonish defendant that he was waving his right to confront witnesses at the first hearing, the trial court only conditionally accepted the plea at the first hearing and corrected the deficiency by giving the admonishment at the second hearing. The court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's petition for probation.

Stat., ch. 111 1/2, &sect;&sect; 1012(a), (d), that ordered it to cease and desist from such violations and to maintain its water-treatment system to meet effluent criteria, and that imposed a penalty for past violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued that it could not be held liable for &quot;allowing&quot; the polluting discharges in violation of the act because they were the result of rain water, a natural force beyond its control, interacting with a gob pile, the bulk of which was created prior to the effective date of the act. It also argued the imposition of a monetary penalty by the board was unauthorized. The court affirmed, as modified, the board's decision that he company violated the act because the discharges flowed from its land and the gob pile it had created. The court found that the act did not require that the company act intentionally to be liable, it was enough that the discharges caused the water pollution. The court concluded that the act was not applied retroactively to the company because the company admitted that after the act's effective date it added to the gob pile, a clear violation, and four instances of water pollution occurred. The court reduced the monetary penalty because the board acted arbitrarily in imposing it, as neither its findings nor the facts supported it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged in an indictment with the offense of intimidation. From its examination of the record on appeal, the court could not say that the testimony of the complaining witness was so unsatisfactory as to leave a reasonable doubt of the guilt of defendants as a matter of law. Therefore, the court did not disturb the jury's verdict. The court did not find any error in remarks or questions from the trial judge. The remarks and questions were aimed at the clarification of the questions asked by counsel and at the clarification of the reasons for his own rulings, both of which were legitimate purposes. Defendants also contended that the minimum sentence of two years had to be reduced to bring the sentence into compliance with the requirements of the Unified Code of Corrections. Intimidation was a Class 3 felony under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-6(b) (1973). Therefore, the minimum sentence could not exceed one-third the maximum sentence of five years under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-1(c)(4) (1973). The court concluded that because the case had not reached a final adjudication the minimum sentence would be modified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment of conviction but modified the minimum sentence to one year and eight months.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the motions with respect to the termination of defendants' probation terms but denied the motions with respect to the other relief requested. On appeal, the court held that because &sect; 22-40 was unconstitutional, it was void rather than merely voidable.

Defendant entered into a plea agreement and pleaded guilty to robbery and aggravated battery. He was sentenced to 2 to 12 years in the penitentiary. Defendant appealed his convictions, and the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the Juvenile Court Act did not apply to defendant and that he was not denied equal protection of the law because of the age variance between the sexes. The court found that defendant's assertion that the trial court misled him into believing that he was pleading guilty to a misdemeanor battery charge was an exaggerated application of the use of Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 402(c). The court rejected the defense of compulsion and noted that defendant was the one in possession of the shotgun. The court concluded that the aggravated battery was separately motivated from the robbery. The court noted that, after the attendant was ordered to lie on the floor and after the money was taken, defendant struck the attendant over the head with the butt of the gun, which resulted in injuries that required about 100 stitches and hospitalization.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of escape from the Illinois State Penitentiary. Defendant challenged that conviction and argued that the trial court failed to comply with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 402(c), in that it did not determine that there was a factual basis for the plea. Defendant further argued that, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108, par.121, the statute on which the conviction was based, was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted the trial court explained to defendant the nature of the offense, the minimum and maximum, that the sentence would be consecutive to the one he was serving at the time of the escape, his right to plead not guilty, and that by pleading guilty he waived his right to a jury trial and to confrontation. The court further noted that defendant indicated that he was guilty of the offense charged. According to the court, the reading of the indictment was sufficient with defendant's response to establish a factual basis for the plea, and the indictment was specific enough to advise him of the crime for which he was charged. In addition, the court held that the statute's constitutionality had already been determined in a prior case.</SPAN></P>

The claimant alleged that he should have been permitted to resume collection of unemployment benefits and that any moneys he owed were to be recouped from his benefits. The trial court upheld the Board's judgment denying benefits to the claimant until he repaid the amount he had wrongly obtained. The court reversed, determining that the trial court's interpretation of &sect;&sect; 900 and 901 of the Unemployment Compensation Act, Ill. Rev. Code Stat. ch. 48, para. 490 and 491 (1969), gave rise to an invidious classification predicated upon wealth. Under such an interpretation, all individuals who fraudulently obtained benefits were not treated equally because a wrongdoer who had access to money to repay the debt was able to re-establish eligibility for benefits. The state did not have a legitimate interest in refusing to allow the recoupment of fraudulently obtained benefits. The court construed the word &quot;repaid&quot; in &sect; 901 as including direct cash repayment or recoupment from benefits for which the claimant was eligible.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 127 of the Act provided that no license could be issued for the sale of liquor within 100 feet of the school. The court ruled that the 100 feet provision was to have been measured from property line to property line.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed two judgments of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that were consolidated upon his motion. In one case, defendant challenged the constitutionality of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, &sect;&sect; 105-1 through 105-12 (1965), the sexually dangerous persons statute, pursuant to which he was adjudged a sexually dangerous person. In the other case, defendant challenged his convictions of attempted rape and aggravated kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first case, defendant did not challenge the constitutionality of the sexually dangerous persons statute until he filed his appellate brief. The court held that such a challenge could not be made on appeal because it was not raised before the trial court. In the second case, defendant argued on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court rejected this contention. Defendant was guilty of attempted rape because the evidence revealed that defendant intended to rape the victim and that his conduct constituted a substantial step toward achieving that objective even though he eventually abandoned the project. Because defendant was guilty of attempted rape and his conduct with the victim also constituted a secret confinement, the evidence sustained the finding of guilty of aggravated kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court refused to consider defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of the sexually dangerous persons statute. The court affirmed defendant's conviction of attempted rape and aggravated kidnapping.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner company sought review of an order of respondent Pollution Control Board (board), which denied it a variance from the Environmental Protection Act, 1971 Ill. Comp. Stat. ch. 111 1/2 par. 1001 et seq. The board found that the company had caused air pollution and had emitted particulates into the atmosphere in an amount exceeding the limits set forth in the Rules and Regulations Governing the Control of Air Pollution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company had contended, inter alia, that: 1) the Environmental Protection Act was unconstitutional in that: (a) it was vague and indefinite; (b) unlimited discretion and legislative power was delegated to the board and; (c) the Act conferred judicial power upon an administrative agency. First, the court found that the complaint did not allege violations of the Rules and Regulations Governing the Control of Air Pollution and that finding was reversed. However, the court also found that the statute was constitutional because statutes directed at control of pollution in the environment were intended to encompass infinitely variable conditions. Therefore, flexibility and adaptability were required. Further, the discretionary power delegated to the board was clearly limited by the statutory requirement that the board determine standards and held that the authority to impose monetary penalties did not constitute a prohibited grant of judicial power. Thus, the court affirmed the order of the board concluded that air pollution caused by the company had unreasonably interfered with enjoyment of life and property, and that the company was in violation of the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of the order of the Pollution Control Board ordering the company to comply with the statute. The court reversed that part of the order finding the company in violation of the board's Rules and Regulations and remanded the cause to the board for a redetermination of an appropriate penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Illinois Fair Employment Practices Commission (commission) filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the order from the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois), which granted a preliminary injunction in favor of appellee class of contractors restraining the commission's enforcement of an affirmative action program relating to public contracts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractors and the class they purported to represent described themselves as ones who sought construction contracts with the State of Illinois. They objected to the commission's affirmative action plans. The basic injury alleged was that the contractors would be impaired in their ability to bid competitively for state contracts. The trial court granted a preliminary injunction. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the fact that the suit was brought as a class action clearly indicated that no competitive injury could result to any of the contractors because the class was composed of all contractors who intended to compete with each other in bids for state contracts. The court found further that the alleged immediate severity of the regulations' impact upon the contractors in no way indicated pre-enforcement relief. The feared injury was clearly prospective and was neither severe nor immediate. The court also found that the contractors had an adequate remedy at law because they would be afforded an administrative hearing subject to judicial review before any non-compliance orders would be issued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order and remanded with directions to dismiss the complaint for want of equity.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, the debtor's bank account was garnished twice in order to satisfy the judgment. The debtor filed a motion to vacate the judgment, to vacate the garnishment against her bank account, and for an order that the creditor return the funds already garnished and pay the service charges incurred by her. The debtor claimed that she was deprived of her property without due process of law. The trial court denied her motion and stated specifically that it was not passing upon the constitutional issue. The debtor appealed, and the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 72 (1973) and Ill Sup. Ct. R. 276 required the debtor to show that she worked diligently in pursuing the relief sought. The debtor made no such showing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff stopped payment on check for mechanical repairs, and defendant seized vehicle. Defendant contended that its surrender of the vehicle did not constitute relinquishment of its mechanic's lien for work performed, and that it was entitled to enforce its lien without legal process as long as no actual breach of the peace ensued. Defendant's mechanic's lien survived surrender of actual possession of the vehicle to plaintiffs. However, Ill. Rev. Stat. 1971, ch. 82, par. 47(a) was silent regarding such authorization, and the court would not write into the statute such an exception to normal judicial procedures. Defendant also contended that plaintiffs' failure to tender the amount allegedly constituted failure to perform, a condition precedent to a replevin action. However, defendant made no specific allegation to that effect. As averment was made in support of defendant's claim for damages rather than for omission of a condition precedent, that issue was waived.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Affirmed, because seizure was not statutorily authorized to enforce a mechanic's lien.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 11-6 of the School Code, Ill. Rev.

Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 264-279 (1971). The superintendent's approval of the petition at bar was not defined as an administrative decision subject to review under the Administrative Review Act. In denying the motion to vacate the trial court's order of dismissal, the court held that other statutory, equitable, or common-law modes of review remained available. According to the court, the amendment of &sect; 11-6 of the School Code was not unconstitutional simply because it provided for administrative review only of orders by the superintendent denying petitions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subject property was surrounded by water on three sides. The main residence was once a large three-story mansion that had been remodeled by the former owners into a retreat house for communal living. There were several accessory buildings that included a two-story residence used by the director of the facility and a coachhouse suitable for a projected vocational training use. Two private residences adjoined the property. The county initially alleged that the corporation was occupying the subject property as a treatment center for drug addicts. The prior use was a religious retreat and the county alleged that a certificate was required and had not been obtained for the change in use. The corporation answered that its use was residential and therefore the same as the prior use and that it had provided the county with that information but the county failed to act on its request. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment and concluded that from a fair reading of the lower court judge's memorandum opinion, he did find that the corporation qualified as a sheltered care home, and not merely that it was a different but compatible use with that principal use.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) although a showing that the lower court was obviously irritated with defendant would warrant reversal, such were not prejudicial where they were invoked by defense counsel; (2) without corroboration or medical reports, the testimony of one witness was sufficient to establish bodily harm component of battery; (3) defendant was not prejudiced by the officers' testimony concerning the surrounding circumstances of the arrest because the testimony was relevant; and (4) the complaint was sufficient although it failed to state the specific acts committed by defendant because the complaint was framed substantially in the words of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was prosecuted as an adult for the murder of his two sisters. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppression the shotgun on the basis that it was obtained because of an illegal seizure by the sheriff. Despite the fact that the case against defendant rested upon circumstantial evidence, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to satisfy the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty. The facts clearly showed that defendant had the opportunity and means to murder his sisters. Moreover, the jury was justified in concluding that defendant's hypothesis of innocence was not a reasonable one. The court did not review defendant's contention that it was error to allow an 11 year old to testify without a preliminary examination by the trial court because defendant did not raise an objection to the competency of the witness. Additionally, the witness was obviously competent because a thorough and complete preliminary examination by the trial court and defense counsel was conducted during the detention hearing. Finally, the evidence in the case established a legally effective waiver of defendant's right against unreasonable search and seizure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Congress authorized the construction of a water reservoir project to be located on a river. The project was to spread over portions of three counties.

Congress would not provide funding for the project until the State entered into an agreement with the federal government concerning the subjects of water supply and recreation as they related to the project. Each count of the complaint asserted that the described agreements would violate the Constitution of the State of Illinois and infringe other rights of plaintiffs. The trial judge found that plaintiffs failed to state a cause of action upon which injunctive relief could have been based. On appeal, the court agreed with the trial court that plaintiffs' complaint did not allege facts or reasons establishing, or tending to establish the necessity for either consent or consultation with plaintiffs because defendants did not seek to condemn any of the lands in question.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that to have proper standing to bring an election contest the voters must have been persons entitled to vote on the referendum. The trial court found that because the voters lived within the corporate limits of the city they did not have the capacity to sue and in accordance with Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 110, para. 48(1)(b) dismissed the case. The issue involved was whether or not an unincorporated area of a township could hold an election and limit the eligible voters to those residents who resided in the unincorporated area of the township. The court held that there was no constitutional requirement that the legislature adhere to county or township lines in authorizing local option in certain area or districts, and it might authorize residents of non-contiguous territory to act as a unit voting upon the proposition of whether intoxicating liquor could be sold therein, as electors outside of incorporated districts should have the same right as electors in municipalities. The court therefore held that the unincorporated area of the township could vote as a unit. Because the voters resided in the city, they were not eligible to vote and thus had no standing to sue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a pre-trial motion to strike his indictment which alleged that the jury commission had excluded persons who were 18 to 20 years from the selection of a grand jury. The motion was denied. At the time defendant entered a change of his plea, the circuit court had a colloquy with defendant about whether the plea was voluntary, whether he understood he was waiving his constitutional rights, and whether he entered the plea intelligently. Defendant contended that a grand jury that indicted him was not properly composed of all the individuals who were qualified to serve and that the circuit court erred in acceptance of the negotiated plea. The court held that: (1) a state could have constitutionally prescribed specific qualifications of age for jury service even though a person may be qualified to vote because he was old enough and at the same time be disqualified from service on a grand or petit jury because he was either too old or too young; and (2) the circuit court correctly determined that defendant's guilty plea was voluntary and that at the time defendant was aware of his rights that he waived and the consequences of his plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The township brought an action against defendants, seeking injunctions preventing the treasurer from withholding funds payable from taxes collected for the benefit of the township. The county filed a counterclaim, seeking a judgment against the township for the amount that the treasurer was threatening to withhold. The trial court denied the township's motion to dismiss the counterclaim. After the township elected to stand on its motion by declining to answer the counterclaim, the cause was considered as confessed and judgment was entered in favor of the county for the amount that it sought in its counterclaim. On appeal, the court found no merit to the township's contention that the statutory provisions dealing with the appointment of members of the County Board of Review and the clerk thereof, together with the compensation for such officers, excluded the county from authorizing and paying for such assistants as the Board of Review might need. Finally, the court found that the law imposed the primary duty of paying the costs of assessment of personal property upon the township as a quasi-municipal corporation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a sister and brother, appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Warren County (Illinois), which convicted them of illegal delivery of 28.74 grams of a substance containing cannabis. The sister was sentenced to three years probation and the brother was sentenced to a term of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged the constitutionality of the statute under which they were indicted, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 705 (1973), and in the alternative, the trial court's abuse of discretion in sentencing only the brother to a term of imprisonment. The court affirmed. Defendants failed to preserve for review the issue of the constitutionality of the statute. Further, defendants failed to properly raise the issue of the statute's validity because they failed to present any direct evidence regarding the effect of its allegedly unconstitutional aspects on their case. The discrepancy in sentencing was justified by the fact that the brother had three prior misdemeanor convictions, was on probation at the time of the offense, and was unemployed. The sister was employed and had a clean record with the exception of one previous conviction for illegal possession of alcohol. The brother was not entitled to a sentence reduction because there was no showing that a lesser sentence would have been imposed under the new Unified Code of Corrections.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the evidence established entrapment, but, if not, that the verdict was against the evidence, that the indictment was defective, that rulings on evidence were erroneous, that the sentence was excessive, and that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 705(d) (1971) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant met an informer while both were working in a department store. Defendant and the informer exchanged military experiences and admitted smoking marijuana in Vietnam. The informer and defendant discussed finding marijuana, and the informer called defendant looking for the drug. On the sixth call, defendant arranged to meet the informer to sell him marijuana and asked if the informer wanted to form a partnership to sell marijuana. The informer contacted police, who arrested defendant at the place of delivery. Defendant was convicted, and he appealed. The court modified and affirmed, holding that defendant was not entrapped as a matter of law, and the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The indictment set forth the nature and elements of the offense and gave defendant notice of the charge against him, enabled him to prepare a defense and to protect himself from subsequent prosecution for the same offense. Defendant failed to raise the constitutionality of para. 705(d) below, so it was not subject to review. Cross-examination of the informer was proper. However, the court found that the ends of justice would be served by modifying the sentence to probation.</SPAN></P>

The jury found defendant guilty of unlawful use of weapon. The court reversed and held that an investigator's references to other criminal acts were made as he testified to two conversations with defendant prior to and separate from the conversation dealing with the particular charge in issue. Placed in the context of the entire testimony, the State emphasized the evidence concerning the marijuana even though at the start of the trial, the State moved to dismiss those charges. The court held that the impact of the testimony on the jury could only have been prejudicial and, therefore, erroneous. Further, the conversations testified to by the investigating officers between themselves and defendant did not justify any basis for an inference upon which proof beyond a reasonable doubt could be based.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which revoked his probation and imposed consecutive prison sentences of 5 to 10 years and 5 to 15 years for attempted murder and armed robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The probation order included a special condition that defendant finish high school and thereafter continue his education or become regularly and gainfully employed. The State's evidence showed that defendant failed to appear on scheduled court dates, report to his probation officer, and stay in school or get a job, and that he admitted carrying a shot gun and pistol during a holdup. Defendant testified that he was unable to attend school or work because he was in jail and that he was acting as a police informer when he took part in the holdup. Affirming the revocation of probation, the court held that even if defendant participated in the holdup at the request of the police, his possession of deadly weapons was a plain violation of his probation. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion because defendant was charged with other crimes and violated court orders that he attend school or work. The court determined that the sentences were lawful, but modified them to run concurrently, and ruled that defendant was entitled to credit for time served on probation because Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-6-4 (Supp. 1972) became effective before the case was finally adjudicated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment revoking defendant's probation and remanded the cause with directions to modify the sentences by making them run concurrently rather than consecutively and to issue an amended mittimus reflecting credit for the time defendant served on probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business acquired an interest in the surface estate of a piece of property. Although the land was acquired with the expectation of surface mining the coal underlying the property, the primary business was farming. The mine site was inspected by a state surveillance engineer, which found that water samples were polluted with acid mine drainage. The board found the business guilty of violating the Illinois Environmental Protection Act (Act), and the court affirmed the order. The court held that there was no unlawful or unconstitutional delegation to the board, and the business was afforded all required protections. The Act was constitutional as applied to the business, and the findings of the board as to the ability of the business to control the pollutional discharge were correct. Lack of knowledge that the discharge existed provided the business no defense, and the evidence was sufficient to support the board's order. Further, the court found that the constitutional arguments made by the business were without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was serving two concurrent two to five year prison terms when he allegedly escaped. Defendant pled guilty to the crime of escape, and he was sentenced by the circuit court. Defendant appealed, claiming that his sentence did not conform to the new Unified Code of Corrections and that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108, para. 121 (1971) was unconstitutional because it denied him equal protection of the law. The court affirmed, holding that while the Unified Code of Corrections applied to cases on direct appeal, the circuit court committed no error in sentencing defendant to one to two years' imprisonment. The court determined that &sect; 5-8-1(c)(3) of the Unif. Code Corr., Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-1(c)(3), which limited the minimum term to one third of the maximum term set by the circuit court, was not applicable as the circuit court did not set a higher minimum term than the one-year minimum term. The court concluded that defendant's equal protection rights were not violated because whether he was prosecuted under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108, para. 121 (1971), or under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1003-6-4 (1972 Supp.), the results would have been the same.</SPAN></P>

After considering the testimony of all the witnesses contained in the record of the appeal, the briefs, and oral arguments of counsel, the court concluded that the mercury regulation was not contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. The language of the applicable statutes conferred express authority upon the Board to regulate discharge into sewers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fire insurer's policy covered the insured's losses caused by fire, and the insurer's policy covered losses resulting from the insured's failure to effectively provide insurance coverage. The fire insurer sent the insured a cancellation notice. Several weeks after its effective date, the fire loss occurred. The court reversed the trial court's orders and judgment and remanded the action. The insurer contended that the purported cancellation was ineffective because the fire insurer had failed to follow a federal plan for policy cancellation to which it was required to agree by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 73, paras. 1065.69 - 1065.78. To support its argument, the insurer presented documents for the first time on appeal that purported to show that the fire insurer had executed and filed a document with the state director of insurance by which it agreed to the requirements. The court refused to take judicial notice of the documents because they introduced new factual evidence not presented to the trial court. However, the pleadings in the action placed factual questions in issue pertaining to the disputed agreement, and those issues required remand to the trial court for resolution.</SPAN></P>

There were alternative means for the preparation of a record with respect to review of guilty pleas.

At trial, defendant denied that he had threatened the victim and he claimed that he stabbed the victim in self-defense. Defendant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to 7 to 20 years' imprisonment. Defendant sought review and argued that the State failed to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, that he was improperly limited to 10 peremptory jury challenges, and that his sentence was excessive. The court found that at the time of defendant's trial, the trial court was precluded from imposing the death penalty, that defendant's case fell within the provisions of &sect; 115-4(e) of the Illinois Code of Criminal Procedure, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115(4)(e) (1971), and that the 10 peremptory challenges were proper. The court also found that the State met its burden of overcoming the defense of self-defense, that defendant's minimum sentence was miscalculated, and that he was entitled to a reduction in his minimum sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for delivery of cannabis in an amount less than 2.5 grams. On appeal, he claimed that the Cannabis Control Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 701 et seq. (1971) was unconstitutional in that it denied defendant equal protection of the law because it granted the prosecutor an election of charging defendant with either a Class A, Class B or Class C misdemeanor. The court held that based on the language of the Cannabis Control Act, neither the prosecutor nor the court had an election. If delivery was without consideration, the penalty for possession was required, but if delivery was for a consideration, then, by definition, the delivery was not a casual delivery and the penalty for delivery of cannabis was required. The court held that even if there were no such distinctions, there would still have been no constitutional deficiency in the circumstance that the prosecutor was given the power to elect which procedure he would undertake. The court further found that there was no unconstitutionality by virtue of the provisions relating to the determination by the weight of the quantity of cannabis possessed or the penalty which might have been imposed.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) denied the trustee's motion for a restraining order and granted defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint. The trustee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 1969 assessment on the trustee's property and improvements was $ 117,429. The 1970 and 1971 assessments were $ 173,766. The trustee alleged that the assessment violated due process of law, was grossly excessive, constructively fraudulent, and was not comparable to the assessment on other property in the vicinity. The Board of Tax Appeals affirmed the assessment. The trustee paid a portion of the taxes, but was unable to make the payment in full because of insufficient funds. The trustee alleged that the requirement that the taxes be paid under protest before he could object to a judgment and sale of the property deprived him of due process of law. The court held that the trial court properly denied the trustee's motion for a restraining order because neither the complaint nor the motion for a restraining order was verified which was essential for such an order. The court held that the trial court properly dismissed the trustee's complaint because the complaint was insufficient. The trustee's complaint failed to allege the essential allegation that the trustee was unable to pay the taxes under protest.</SPAN></P>

In his alibi notice, defendant indicated that he was at home when the sales were made; however, in his opening statement, defendant's attorney told the jury that witnesses would testify that defendant was not at home and the witnesses testified to that effect. After the State was denied permission to call the alibi witnesses in rebuttal, it moved to strike the alibi testimony. The trial court determined that defendant was bound by the error contained in his alibi notice and granted the motion to strike. Defendant was convicted and the court reversed. It found that the motion to strike was untimely because the State was fully aware of the contents of the alibi notice, but offered no objection to defense counsel's opening statement or the testimony of the alibi witnesses. Further, the trial court prejudiced defendant by striking all of the alibi testimony and compounded the error by stating it was stricken because the witnesses testified contrary to what they had indicated in the notice when there was no evidence that the witnesses had ever seen the alibi notice.</SPAN></P>

The court found nothing in the methods of selecting juries to indicate the use of any physical or mechanical means to exclude prospective jurors.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner salvage company sought review of an order from respondent Pollution Control Board (Illinois), which imposed a monetary fine and ordered the salvage company to cease and desist open burning. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) filed a complaint pursuant to &sect;31(a) of the Environmental Protection Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, &sect; 1001 et seq. (1971) before the board. The salvage company's motion for directed verdict was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The salvage company, which was burning salvaged cars on their property, raised several issues on appeal. The court affirmed the board's order to cease and desist, but reversed the fine imposed under &sect; 42 of the Act as unconstitutional and void because it was an unconstitutional delegation of judicial power. The court held that the terms &quot;air pollution&quot; and &quot;open burning&quot; as used in the Act were not so vague as to be unenforceable. The court affirmed the board's denial of the salvage company's demand for a jury trial and motion to transfer to the circuit court because the action was not a criminal matter. A finding of a violation of the Act would not lead to imprisonment, nor appear on the violator's record, and therefore it was not entitled to the same protections as a criminal case. The court found that the board met the requirements of &sect; 33(c) of the Act, which required that the board take into consideration all the relevant facts and circumstances which would go to the reasonableness of the alleged practice, and held that it could not substitute its judgment for that of an agency. The court held that the board's decision was supported by the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the board's issuance of a cease and desist order against the salvage company for open burning in violation of the Act, but held that the imposition of the monetary penalty was unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted him, following a bench trial, for leaving the scene of an accident in violation of &sect; 11--401(a) of the Motor Vehicle Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11--401(a) (1971). He contended, in part, that he was not proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, the victim testified that he was hit by a car, that he did not see the car after he was hit, and that he went to a hospital. A witness testified that he heard the brakes of a car and saw the victim on the ground. The victim was crying and yelling. The witness observed the driver, who he identified as defendant, get out and approach the victim, get back in his car and park, re-approach the victim, but then drive off as a squad car came by. The witness gave the police officer defendant's license plate number. Another witness testified that he saw the victim flying through the air, never saw the driver leave his car, but saw him drive off. Defendant's motion to dismiss after the State concluded its evidence was denied. He presented no evidence on his behalf. The court held, based on the undisputed evidence, that an injury had occurred, which triggered defendant's duty to comply with &sect; 11--401(a) and with Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-- 403 (1971) by providing assistance and giving his name, address, and vehicle registration number to the victim. The court refused to consider defendant's other contention because it was raised for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

He claimed that his plea of guilty was improperly coerced by the trial judge's participation in the plea discussions and that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because of the public defender's alleged conflict of interest in representing both petitioner and his two co-defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was indicted with two others for murder. He entered a guilty plea and was sentenced. Thereafter, he sought post-conviction relief claiming that he did not want to plead guilty but felt he had no effective choice after he was informed that the judge before whom he would be tried had participated in plea bargaining discussions. The trial court denied his petition and the court affirmed. It found that while a trial judge was prohibited from initiating plea discussions, judicial participation in plea bargaining was not unconstitutional. Further, there was nothing in the record to lead the court to the conclusion that any ground existed for petitioner's conclusion that he would be penalized if he rejected the agreement and exercised his right to a trial. The court also found that petitioner was not denied effective assistance of counsel by being appointed the same public defender as his co-defendants, because a motion for severance could have been made if petitioner had not entered a guilty plea. Further, counsel's suggestion that petitioner plead guilty did not conflict with his petitioner's best interests, as petitioner had confessed and had no defense to the murder charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision, which determined that petitioner's guilty plea was voluntary, that he was not denied effective assistance of counsel, and denied his petition for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a contract purchaser, a developer, and property owners, sought review of the decision from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which granted judgment in favor of defendant county and intervenors, an adjacent property owner and two school districts, in a declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed an application with the county's zoning board of appeals to have a tract of land reclassified from a single family district to a general commercial district and to obtain a special use for a mobile home park, a sewage plant, and a community well. The board denied plaintiffs' request. Plaintiffs filed a declaratory judgment action that sought to have the single family zoning classification declared invalid and unenforceable. The trial court granted judgment in favor of the intervenors and the county. On appeal, the court held that plaintiffs had met their burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the zoning ordinance, as applied to the property, was invalid. Therefore, the trial court's decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court found that, under the totality of the evidence, plaintiffs sufficiently established that the property was not economically suitable for development as it was zoned and that the highest and best use of the property was not the development of single family residences. The court concluded that the hardship to plaintiffs did not outweigh nor justify the unreasonable and arbitrary restrictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
