</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order denying an application for an injunction to terminate appellee community's exclusion of appellant's newspaper from its gated community and limiting jury trial issues to Cartwright Act and Unfair Trade Practices Act. Appellant sought to distribute its unsolicited give-away newspaper to the private residences of appellee's walled and gated private retirement community. Appellee was the corporation who owned the streets, sidewalks and other common property in the retirement community. The other appellee, a competing give-away newspaper, was permitted to deliver its paper to the community because it had by a single agreement subscribed all the private residences to the paper. The court reversed the trial court's denial of appellant's request for injunctive relief finding that, if the appellee community was permitting a competing paper into the community, it must also let appellant's paper in. The court directed the trial court to grant a conditional injunction. The court also directed the trial court to try issues under the California Business and Professions Code subject to the four-year limitation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff teachers association filed suit to challenge the constitutionality of the statutes which allowed the state to lend textbooks to students who attended non-profit schools in the state. The trial court ruled that the statutes were constitutional. A second suit was filed to challenge the administration of the code provisions. The trial court found the process used to be valid. Plaintiff appealed both decisions. In a consolidated appeal, the court ruled that the statutes, which allowed the loan of obsolete or surplus materials did not violate U.S. Const. amend. I, because it merely made available to all children benefits of a general program. The program had a secular purpose, did not advance religion, and avoided excessive government entanglement with religion. The court also found that the administrative process used to identify and lend the books was constitutionally permissible and it affirmed the decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner physician's patient died after a hysterectomy. Respondent medical quality assurance board found petitioner grossly negligent and suspended his medical license for one year. The trial court found that one of the board members changed his vote to gross negligence after speaking with several friends outside the proceedings. The trial court issued a peremptory writ of mandate requiring the board to dismiss the accusation or to re-decide the case without the participation of that board member. Respondent made the same finding. The trial court denied petitioner's request for a writ of mandate. The court held that the improper action of the board member during the first hearing did not taint the second hearing. The court held that the judgment of the trial court was supported by substantial evidence because several physicians testified during the administrative hearing that petitioner was grossly negligent in his failure to administer the proper tests. The court held that petitioner was grossly negligent because his management of his patient was an extreme departure from the standard of medical care. Therefore, the court affirmed that judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The house of appellant homeowners was damaged by earth movements. Subsequently, appellants brought suit to recover for such damages against respondent engineers and respondent contractors, among others. Respondents were involved in the grading and filling of the slope that moved and caused the damage. Respondents demurred to the complaint, arguing it was barred on its face by the statute of limitations, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 337.15. The trial court sustained the demurrers and entered judgments of dismissal. Appellants sought review, contending the 10-year period prescribed by &sect; 337.15 did not commence until the development was substantially completed. On review, the court reversed as to appellants' 17th and 19th causes of action, because the allegations in those causes of action presented a factual dispute over the application of the statute of limitations. However, the court affirmed as to the remainder of the claims against respondents because the alleged defect involved work which was completed more than 10 years prior to the filing of the complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insurer issued an automobile insurance liability policy to defendant husband in his name only covering a vehicle owned by him and defendant wife. Defendant wife was injured while she was riding as a passenger in the insured vehicle. Plaintiff insurer sued for declaratory relief to obtain a ruling on the family exclusion clause of the insurance policy issued to defendant husband. The lower court ruled that plaintiff did not have a duty to defend or indemnify defendant husband, and defendant wife appealed. Plaintiff's family member inclusion was authorized by Cal. Ins. Code &sect; 11580.1(c). Defendant wife argued that Cal. Ins. Code &sect; 11580.1 was in violation of the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions to the extend that it permitted the exclusion. The arbitrary classification between family members and non-family members found in &sect; 11580.1(c) was in contravention of well-established public policy of the state designed to limit exclusion from insurance coverage and to encourage coverage. The court found that &sect; 11580.1(c)(5) and the family exclusion clause of the policy eliminated the rights of an entire class and exceeded rational bounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in favor of plaintiff insurer because the court held that the statutory classification violated the equal protection guarantees of the state and federal constitution in that the disparate treatment accorded by the statute was not rationally related to a realistic legislative purpose.</SPAN></P>

The people denied that the instruction had any mandatory effect and claimed that it permitted the jury not to find the presumed fact even if no evidence on the identity of the obliterator other than the proved fact of possession was before it.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver's license to operate a motor vehicle was suspended under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 13353, which provided for suspension on refusal to submit to any chemical test after an arrest for drunk driving. Drunk driving was a crime under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23102. Appellant sought a writ of mandate from the trial court to respondent Department of Motor Vehicles and sought to declare &sect; 13353&nbsp;unconstitutional. The trial court denied the writ, and appellant sought review. The court affirmed the denial. The court held that the statutory scheme of &sect; 13353 was constitutional. Under federal precedent, a state could summarily suspend a driver's license based on a refusal to submit to a chemical test. Statutes providing for license suspension such as &sect; 13353, even without a suspension hearing, did not violate substantive or procedural due process. This was so even though a license to drive an automobile was an important interest similar to a property right. The court rejected appellant's argument that less drastic means were available to achieve the state's purpose. The court held that this was not the test and that the license suspension mechanism of &sect; 13353 rationally served a valid purpose.</SPAN></P>

Analyzing the amendment's legislative history, the court held it did not apply retroactively to individuals insured under nonfreeze policies that were disabled prior to the statute's effective date, as the legislature had rejected a provision that would have explicitly made the statute retroactive.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought a writ ordering respondent trial court to suppress certain evidence seized from his home pursuant to a search warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion seeking to suppress evidence obtained from the search of his home. Defendant asserted that the search warrant failed because the affidavits were largely illegible and could not be the basis for probable cause. Respondent trial court denied defendant's motion. Defendant sought a writ seeking the suppression of the evidence. The court granted defendant's writ. According to the court, the protection afforded by U.S. Const. amend. IV consisted of requiring that the inferences that a crime was committed be drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime. The court held that the magistrate must judge for himself the persuasiveness of the facts relied on by a complaining officer to show probable cause. The court found that the search warrant was deficient because portions of the supporting affidavit incorporated were illegible, and because the magistrate did not read some of the reports which formed a part of the affidavit. The court concluded that the portions that were not read could not form the basis for probable cause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state, as a real party in interest, disputed the grants by the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), of three writs of prohibition directed to respondent Municipal Court for the Antelope Judicial District of Los Angeles County. The issue was whether charging defendants with drunken bicycle riding violated their constitutional right to procedural due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged, under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23102, with drunken bicycle riding. Respondent municipal court denied defendants' demurrers. The appellate court issued writs of prohibition to respondent, and the state, as a real party in interest, appealed. The court held that, under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 670, a bicycle was excluded from Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23102. The court reviewed the legislative history of Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 21200, which real party in interest argued did support the charges against defendants. The court held that a 1943 amendment to its predecessor statute,&nbsp;Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 452, had rendered that statute ambiguous. The ambiguity was continued, and perhaps made worse, in &sect; 21200. Under &sect; 21200, routine traffic infractions did not subject cyclists to criminal punishment. It was therefore unlikely that the legislature intended to make severe drunk driving penalties applicable to defendants. Because &sect; 21200 did not explicitly inform defendants that drunken bicycle riding would subject them to criminal punishment, to so apply it to them would violate their constitutional right to procedural due process. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the writs of prohibition. The court held that, under the relevant statute, a bicycle was not a &quot;vehicle.&quot; The version of the statute sought to be applied to defendants was ambiguous. Because the statute did not explicitly inform them that drunken bicycle riding would subject them to criminal punishment, to so apply it to them would violate their constitutional right to procedural due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with kidnapping, in violation of Cal.

After a hearing to determine whether appellant should be released, his term of commitment was extended. Appellant sought review. The court found that it would be cruel and unusual punishment if appellant was recommitted as a MDSO when he could not benefit from such treatment. The court applied the substantial evidence rule to determine whether appellant was amenable to treatment and found that there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable trier of fact to believe beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant could benefit from additional treatment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued trial court error in extending, pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 6316.2, his commitment to a state hospital as a medically disordered sex offender (MDSO) following his plea of guilty to felony charges involving a minor. The court disagreed, ruling that expert testimony of mental health professionals finding appellant to constitute a serious threat of harm to others was admissible, as admissibility was not so much based on the predictability of uncertain future violent behavior as on appellant's present predisposition to committing violence. Moreover, appellant's ex post facto challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 6316.2 was without merit, as appellant did not have a vested right in the ameliorative provisions of the determinate sentencing law prior to its operative, as opposed to effective, date. And as appellant fell within a class of offenders shown to pose a danger to others, he was properly subject to extended commitment without violating equal protection laws. Finally, the court rejected the contention that &sect; 6316.2 was vague or that, to be constitutional, its standards for commitment release must equate with the requirements for commitment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed extending for one year appellant's commitment to a state hospital as a medically disordered sex offender, because extension statute was not constitutionally defective as ex post facto law or violative of appellant's equal protection and due process rights, and because expert testimony of mental health professionals was properly admissible to show appellant's predisposition toward violence that posed threat of harm to others.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Kern County (California) that convicted him of two counts of burglary based upon guilty pleas. Appellant challenged his sentences, claiming Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170.3 was unconstitutional, the trial court erred in applying mitigating and aggravating factors, aggravation by prior conviction was double jeopardy, and counsel was ineffective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170.3 and the sentencing rules promulgated thereunder were constitutional. It was not improper for the legislature to authorize the judiciary to establish sentencing guidelines, as sentencing was an inherently judicial function. Based on all the aggravating and mitigating factors, imposition of the upper term was not improper. Assuming that the trial court erred in counting as multiple victims under Cal. R. Ct. 421(a)(4), the victims of two distinct offenses for which appellant was convicted, there still remained to be considered the great monetary value of the property stolen under Cal. R. Ct. 421(a)(10), and appellant's nine prior convictions in 11 years. Appellant did not prove the mitigating factor of necessity, Cal. R. Ct. 423(a)(8). His plea was not tainted by the omission of an asserted condition of his plea bargain conference, as he did not ask to withdraw his plea when it was omitted. A victim's inflammatory remark did not influence the sentencing decision, enhancement by prior conviction was not double jeopardy, and appellant failed to prove any deficiency in counsel's performance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's convictions and sentences. The court held that the sentencing rules were constitutional. The trial court, on balance, correctly applied the aggravating and mitigating factors to the case. Appellant had not been subjected to double jeopardy, and his counsel did not render ineffective assistance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, bookstore owners, appealed the judgment from the Superior Court of San Diego County (California) that denied their petition for a writ of mandate challenging the revocation of the license to their adult bookstore by respondent, a city, pursuant to City of Oceanside, Cal., City Code &sect; 15.3(18).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, bookstore owners, had arcade booths for peepshows in their adult bookstore. Because customers at the peepshow were arrested and convicted for causing a public nuisance by masturbating while in the booths, respondent, a city, revoked petitioners' business license under Oceanside, Cal., City Code &sect; 15.3(18) for operating a business in a manner that threatened the public health, welfare, or safety. The trial court denied their petition for a writ of mandate challenging the revocation. On appeal, the court held that because &sect; 15.3(18) impinged on petitioners' U.S. Const. amend. I rights of free speech and press, the ordinance was subject to strict scrutiny. Because &sect; 15.3(18) gave broad discretion to public officials to determine what constituted harm to the public health, welfare or safety without giving clear standards that were susceptible to objective measurement as to what constituted the harm, &sect; 15.3(18) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Therefore, the court reversed the order with directions to issue a peremptory writ of mandate.</SPAN></P>

Defendant city's land partially was included within defendant water district's boundaries. Defendants entered a merger agreement to fully merge their water systems.

Municipal water districts were characterized as quasi-municipal corporations and had a broad grant of legislative policy-making power. The court found the merger agreement was a contract of cooperation by two public agencies who joined together to form one integrated water system. The merger agreement was not fatally defective merely because it did not specify a time for its termination. The court reversed because the merger agreement did not substitute defendant city's council for defendant water district's board of directors. The court found the legislative purpose of Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The judgment is reversed.  Appellant's work time/good time credit can be computed after retrial.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California) that convicted him and found true a sentence enhancement under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203.09. Appellant claimed the trial court disregarded his mental illness, failed to state reasons for enhancing his sentence, &sect; 1203.09 was unconstitutional, his waiver of a jury trial was invalid; and he was entitled to work or good time credit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to send appellant to a diagnostic facility pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203.03. There was ample evidence of appellant's instability, but the court assumed, consistent with Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 664, that the trial court properly considered the evidence before rejecting it. The sentence enhancement for a prior conviction under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667.5(b) was compulsory. It was not necessary for the trial court to state reasons, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170(c), for not striking a compulsory sentence. The court held that there was no scienter element for Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203.09 because it was not a criminal offense. Section 1203.09 did not violate equal protection because it was classified by victim, not perpetrator. All this was for naught, however, because as defense counsel had voiced disapproval of appellant's waiver of jury, the waiver was invalid under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. There was no constitutional right to waive jury over counsel's objection. The trial court also erred in not granting sentence credit as required by Cal. Penal Code &sect; 4019(b), (c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded for a new trial. The trial court erred in accepting appellant's waiver of jury in the face of counsel's disapproval of the waiver. Appellant's other contentions regarding the illegality or inappropriateness of his sentence, aside from the lack of credit for presentence custody, were without merit.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the writ. The court affirmed, holding that respondent complied with the substantive and procedural requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act. There was no evidence that respondent's environmental impact statement (EIR) on the proposed demolition was impartial or that respondent unlawfully delegated its review functions to the project developer. The EIR described in good faith the reasonable alternatives to demolition, and respondent's findings were sufficiently detailed so as to comply with Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect; 21081. The California historic preservation statutes did not prohibit demolition, and the city's master plan did not mandate the building's historic preservation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant petitioned for a writ of mandate to direct the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) to vacate its order denying his motion to suppress evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped by a police officer based on his license plate's similarity to one seen near a robbery-homicide. He was handcuffed, but was told he was not under arrest. Officers involved with the case arrived and questioned him without advising him of his Miranda rights. When he said he had been near the scene and had purchased a soda of a brand found at the scene, he was arrested. Defendant's motion to suppress evidence was denied by the trial court. The court directed that defendant's motion be granted. The officer who stopped defendant acknowledged she knew nothing about the case sufficient for her to arrest or detain petitioner, but did so upon direction of another officer. That officer admitted he did not have sufficient information to believe defendant was involved in the robbery. This was an arrest because defendant was handcuffed and not free to leave. Even if it was not, the arrest by the second officer was without probable cause. Other than the inference that petitioner was in the area of the robbery-homicide at about the time it occurred, the only evidence known to the officer was that a certain brand of soda pop can was found at the robbery site.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court directed the lower court to vacate its order denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence and to enter a new order granting defendant's motion. The first officer to encounter defendant knew nothing about the case, and the officer at whose direction she detained defendant did not have sufficient information to believe defendant was involved in the robbery. Defendant was thus arrested without probable cause.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the Act, which defined violations as those that &quot;present an imminent danger&quot; or &quot;substantial probability&quot; of death or &quot;serious physical harm&quot; was sufficiently definite to provide notice as to acts forbidden. The court rejected the equal protection challenge, explaining the statutory classifications for long term and acute care facilities met the rational relationship test because of substantial difference as to staff member qualifications in the institution types.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant appealed from his conviction for violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 211. Defendant pleaded guilty to that offense following denial of his motion to suppress evidence. He was sentenced to five years in the state prison, plus one year enhancement for a prior felony conviction. On appeal, defendant challenged the propriety of the trial court's ruling on his motion to suppress evidence, asserting that the officers had no probable cause to search the trunk of his car. In this case, the officer believed that defendant had recently had contraband in his possession. Under these circumstances, it was reasonable to assume that it had been secreted in the trunk of the car, and probable cause to search there existed. Therefore, the constitutional rights of defendant were not violated. Also, the court noted that defendant's reimprisonment for a parole violation was included as part of the initial imprisonment and was not deemed a separate second felony offense. Therefore, defendant's sentence was properly enhanced for a period of one year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling of the trial court which convicted defendant of robbery and enhanced his sentence by one year where it was shown that the officers had probable cause to search defendant's car trunk. Therefore, defendant's constitutional rights were not violated. Also, the enhanced sentence was proper due to defendant's prior felony conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the People of California, filed complaint to enjoin defendant corporation and its officers from commercially distributing copies of obscene films and magazines. Plaintiff alleged that such distribution was an unlawful business practice as defined under Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 17200. The trial court sustained defendants' demurrer and dismissed plaintiff's complaint. The court reversed the order of dismissal. The court agreed with plaintiff that the complaint adequately alleged an unlawful business practice within the meaning of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 17200. The court held that trafficking in obscene matter, an illegal practice under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 311.2, came within Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 17200 when it was practiced as a business. The court held that plaintiff did not have to allege additionally that defendant's activities were anticompetitive or harmful to the consumer of such products. The court held that the possible application of civil penalties did not render statute unconstitutional, rejecting defendants' argument that civil penalties would amount to a penal sanction in violation of due process of law.</SPAN></P>

It ruled that appellant's in-state activities, which included sending sales representatives, entering contracts, and supervising its product's use, taken together, constituted intrastate business and that, thus, appellant was compelled to qualify to conduct such business under &sect; 2105.

The court denied both petitions. The court held that the statute met constitutional requirements, and that respondents were not compelled to subsidize or extend credit to petitioner, who was a non-indigent, for what was essentially a campaign expense. In considering the second petition, equity required the court to balance respondents' conduct against that of petitioner. The court held that while respondents may have been in contempt, petitioner was partly to blame for waiting so long to submit his report.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent property owner filed a complaint against a contractor alleging that he fraudulently induced respondent to convey title to her residential property to him. Default was entered against both contractor and appellant contractor's wife on October 8, 1977. Appellant and contractor requested that the default judgment be vacated on the grounds of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, claiming that they believed that they had additional time to answer. Appellant's counsel further filed a motion for peremptory disqualification of the judge under Cal. Code of Civ. Proc.  &sect;170.6. The motion was denied on the ground that it was untimely. The court found that the matter had been assigned to a department and not to a judge. The time for filing dictated by the statute referenced a particular judge. The court held that decisions involving advance assignments for trial did not apply if the assignment was merely to a department. The court held that since the motion was timely filed, the trial court was without jurisdiction to hear the motion, and the case was remanded for a hearing on the motion to vacate by another trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State Board of Equalization (board) adopted a rule providing that an amendment to Cal. Const. art.

When respondent San Diego Board of Supervisors applied the &quot;decline in value&quot; standard to 1978-79 property assessments, appellant petitioned for writ of mandate. The trial court denied the petition and declared appellant's rule unconstitutional. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court had properly fulfilled its role in interpreting the administrative rule. It found that voter pamphlets, pertaining to Proposition 13, expressed no intention to relinquish the constitutional guaranty of taxation based on fair market value. Proposition 13 harmonized with Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 1 to maintain the constitutional fair market value limitation, which should be given effect. Proposition 8 required retroactive application as a clarification of Proposition 13.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a conditional plea of guilty to the offense of robbery. As a condition of the plea agreement, the people agreed to dismiss the special allegation of use a deadly or dangerous weapon and agreed that sentencing would be at the trial court's discretion. Defendant challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Tulare County (California) that sentenced defendant to the aggravated term of four years in state prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to robbery and was sentenced to the aggravated term of four years. The court rejected defendant's allegation that the trial court committed sentencing errors and affirmed. The court held that the trial court did not need to orally state the reasons for denying probation because it was implicitly explained by the choice of imprisonment. Although the trial court erred by failing to adequately state the reasons for imprisonment pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170(c), the subsequent articulation of the aggravating factors cured any error. Despite defendant's allegations of error with respect to the imposition of the aggravated sentence, the court held that that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the aggravated term for robbery pursuant to Cal. R. Ct. 421(a). The court held that the trial court properly considered the threat of great bodily harm, defendant's use of a deadly weapon, the victim's particular vulnerability, and premeditation for purposes of aggravation. The court also held that, pursuant to Cal. R. Ct. 421(b)(2), the trial court could use defendant's prior adult convictions and juvenile adjudications for aggravation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, loan broker and California Real Estate Commissioner, challenged an adverse judgment of the Superior Court of Alameda County (California). Appellant borrowers challenged the limited amount of that judgment in their action for usury and sought a larger award from appellant loan broker. Appellant commissioner contended that the superior court erred in awarding litigation costs to appellant borrowers in addition to their judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant borrowers applied for payment of the judgment obtained in their class action against appellant loan broker that alleged that he charged usurious amounts for financial services. The court affirmed the judgment subject to modification. The court held that appellant loan broker's challenge to the judgment's enforcement lacked merit because appellant borrowers had satisfied the requirements of the Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 10471 to recover from the Real Estate Fund. The court determined that appellant loan broker brought an impermissible collateral attack on the judgment because he could not relitigate the issue of misrepresentation that occurred while he was licensed. The court held that appellant borrowers' challenge to the statutory limitation on their recovery lacked merit because Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 10474(a), which required this cap on damages, applied based on their lawsuit's filing date. Plus, appellant borrowers could only recover for appellant loan broker's use of one license when only one license was required. The court ruled for appellant California Real Estate Commissioner by modifying the judgment to delete the award of costs to appellant borrowers.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial court judgments in favor of defendants. The court found no violation of constitutional due process in the penalty provisions of &sect; 1428. The court held that &sect; 1428 was a legislative offer to settle the citation at the earliest possible time in exchange for the least possible penalty.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for second degree burglary and grand theft, with a finding of a prior felony conviction. The court affirmed the conviction but remanded for a determination of the sentencing credit appellant was entitled to under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 2900.5, 4019. The court held that the denial of appellant's motion to suppress was proper because there was probable cause to arrest another suspect, and the search of the suspect's purse incident to her arrest fell squarely within the search warrant exception for a search incident to arrest. Therefore the evidence was legally obtained and was admissible. Probable cause was based on the suspect's suspicious movements in the middle of the night, her active assistance in appellant's escape efforts, and her untruthful answers to the officer. Evidence of the prior convection was admissible because the Beagle factors were fully satisfied. Appellant's argument that Cal. Jury Instruction - Criminal No. 2.62 was unconstitutional failed because that jury instruction did not violate the Griffin rule or improperly single out appellant's testimony for special consideration by the jury.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 12811(a) gave respondent the authority to require a photograph on a license renewal. The court determined that that the words &quot;issue&quot; and &quot;issued&quot; encompassed both original delivery of a license and any redelivery thereof by renewal. The court concluded that if the foregoing were not so, certain statutory provisions relating to renewal would have no meaning because they incorporated the provisions pertaining to original issuance of a license. The court found that the photograph requirement did not violate appellant's right of privacy because the only requirements for production of the license pertained to situations where he would be present and could be observed by the person requesting the license.</SPAN></P>

As the court found that the attorney was a witness and not the &quot;advocate,&quot; no misconduct existed. Defendant argued that the attorney's testimony was a breach of Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct Rule 2-111(A)(4) because a member of his &quot;law firm,&quot; the district attorney's office, represented the state. The court affirmed, as defendant's failure to object to the deputy district attorney's testimony or to attempt to recuse the district attorney's office waived his contention of &quot;misconduct&quot; because it could have been &quot;cured.&quot; The court concluded that Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 91002's prohibition against being a candidate for any elective office for a period of four years following defendant's conviction date was not unconstitutional because it gave candidates fair notice of crimes with which they might be charged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a doctor, sought review of his convictions, following a jury trial in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), on 35 counts of prescribing a controlled substance not in his regular practice, all in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11154. Defendant's motions to set aside the information under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 995 and for a judgment of acquittal under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a doctor, argued that Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11154 was too vague and indefinite to provide a standard by which a trier of fact could determine a defendant's guilt and, therefore, was unconstitutional as a denial of due process of law. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in refusing to give an instruction offered by him which set forth in detail the factors that could be considered by the jury in determining whether violations of &sect; 11154 had occurred. In addition, defendant argued that he was deprived of his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel at trial because of his counsel's failure to argue that his prosecution was barred pursuant to the doctrine of collateral estoppel. On appeal, the court found no merit in any of defendant's contentions. The court held that &sect; 11154 was immune from constitutional attack. The court also held that defendant's requested instruction was not required, and that since it was clear that no potentially meritorious defense was withdrawn as the result of the claimed omission, defendant's contention of inadequate representation failed. Accordingly, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision by the trial court denying his motion to suppress evidence. Defendant challenged the stop and search of defendant's vehicle at a California plant quarantine inspection station. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's challenge. The court held that there was no U.S. Const. amend. IV violation under the facts of this case. The court held that quarantine officers could stop motorists at the inspection stations and request to look into the trunk of the vehicle. The court also held that if the motorist voluntarily opened the trunk of the vehicle, the quarantine officer could look therein and, as here, remove any plant materials in plain view for further inspection. The court also rejected defendant's suggestion that a sign should have been placed at inspection stations or that quarantine officers should have advised motorists that they may refuse to give their consent to any search. The court held that the lack of a warning sign or advice by the quarantine officer did not render the circumstances of the case violative of the Fourth Amendment or Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 13.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for obstructing a sidewalk in violation of San Francisco, Cal., Code &sect; 20A (1977). The authority for adopting the ordinance came from Cal. Penal Code &sect; 647c. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress a bag containing heroin found in the police car used to transport her to jail. On appeal, the court directed the trial court to vacate its order denying the motion, finding that the ordinance was critically different from Cal. Penal Code &sect; 647c because it only required that the obstructing be done &quot;willfully,&quot; rather than &quot;willfully and maliciously,&quot; as provided in &sect; 647c. The court noted that by requiring only willfulness, the ordinance swept in all variety of harmless activities. The court found that the ordinance was to be read as requiring maliciousness and when read that way, the ordinance did not justify defendant's arrest because there was no evidence to support a strong suspicion that she acted with malice in obstructing the sidewalk. Finally, the court found that the integrity of the judiciary precluded it from permitting introduction of evidence which, but for the existence of a defective ordinance could not have been properly seized.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Board of Administration of the Public Employees' Retirement System challenged the judgment of the superior court (California) that issued a writ of mandate that commanded appellant to redetermine whether respondent female employee should be classified as a safety employee for purposes of calculating her pension, and that declared Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent female employee applied for her pension and contended her job duties entitled her to benefits at the higher &quot;safety&quot; employee rate rather than the lower &quot;general&quot; employee rate. Appellant Board of Administration of the Public Employees' Retirement System denied respondent's request. Respondent filed a petition for writ of mandate in the trial court and the trial court ordered appellant to redetermine respondent's classification. The trial court declared that the statute appellant relied on, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 20020, unconstitutional as it discriminated against respondent solely because of her sex. The appellate court affirmed. The court ruled that respondent's claim was not time barred because the statute of limitations did not begin to run until appellant made its determination in the case. The court ruled that Cal. Const. art. III, &sect; 3.5 limited appellant's authority to determine a statute's constitutionality, and rejected appellant's argument that it divested the trial court of such authority. Rather than invalidate the statute in its entirety the court construed it to apply also to females.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court. The court found that a recent change to the California Constitution did not divest the lower court of jurisdiction to review the issue of a statute's constitutionality.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which convicted him of pimping and pandering in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 266h and 266i, respectively. Defendant argued that the instructions given by the court were inadequate to give the jury an understanding of his theory of defense, and that the court had a duty, sua sponte, to give adequate instructions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of pimping and pandering in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 266h and 266i, respectively. On appeal, he argued that the trial court's instructions to the jury did not adequately advise the jury of the law and his theory of defense. The court found that defendant's theory of the case -- that the alleged prostitute was merely engaged in nude modeling -- required the trial court, sua sponte, to instruct the jury that nude modeling did not constitute an act of prostitution and that an act of procuring a person solely for the purpose of nude modeling did not violate either the pimping or pandering statute. In the absence of such instructions, the jury might well have considered defendant's evidence -- even though different from the prosecution's evidence -- as itself amounting to the commission of the crimes charged. Therefore, the court reversed the conviction because the trial court failed to give instructions necessary for the jury's understanding of the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court had a duty, sua sponte, to give instructions necessary to the jury's understanding of the case and that it failed to do so. The court further held that it was reasonably probable that a result more favorable to defendant would have been reached had not such errors been made. Therefore, the judgment convicting the defendant of pimping and pandering was reversed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's appeal was dismissed because it was untimely and not in compliance with Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1237.5.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Employee and his wife sued appellant equipment manufacturer alleging that while working for respondent employer, he was seriously injured by equipment manufactured by appellant for respondent. Appellant denied liability and filed a cross-complaint against respondent seeking indemnification. Respondent's demurrer was sustained and an order of dismissal followed. The arguments centered on the demurrer to the cause of action for implied indemnity. Respondent argued that the theory was barred by Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 3864. Appellant contended that &sect; 3864 was unconstitutional as abridging a substantive right, violating due process, equal protection, and the privilege and immunities clause of the state constitution. The court affirmed, finding that there was a public purpose sufficient to sustain &sect; 3864, which allowed the legislature to create, enlarge, diminish, or abolish substantive rights. The court determined that the privileges and immunity clause was not applicable to corporations and held that the legislature could differentiate between various classes of citizens as long as the classification was founded on a reasonable basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of receiving stolen property under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 496(1). Defendant admitted at trial that he bought the car from a black man, in contradiction to an officer's testimony that defendant told him that he bought the car from a Mexican. Defendant sought review, arguing that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to hearsay testimony and for failing to file a pretrial motion to suppress evidence, and that it was error for the trial court to fail to instruct the jury sua sponte that it should view his admission with caution. The court affirmed, holding that the record shed no light on counsel's reasons for the challenged conduct, and that the proper procedure for defendant was to file a petition for habeas corpus, which would allow an evidentiary hearing that would more fully explore the issues and allow counsel an opportunity to be heard. The court found that it was not probable that the trial would have had a different result if the trial court had sua sponte instructed the jury as to defendant's admission, because there remained ample evidence from which the jury could have inferred that defendant had knowingly received stolen property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff promoter entered into a contract with defendants, musician and his wholly-owned corporation, by which plaintiff agreed to promote two concerts to be performed by defendant musician.

The arbitrator ruled in defendants' favor and ordered plaintiff to pay damages. The trial court affirmed the arbitration award.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the trial court of selling heroin. Defense counsel urged the trial judge to impose a lower term sentence under a determinate sentencing law, but the trial court refused and instead denied probation and imposed an indeterminate sentence of state prison. Defendant appealed that ruling and claimed that the refusal to provide a determinate sentence was prejudicial as his sentence might have been reduced by one year and that the indeterminate sentence amounted to an ex post facto application of the law. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court sentence. The court held that the sentencing statute at issue, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170, was assigned a specific enactment date by the legislature to avoid drastic consequences under the new law. Although defendant was not sentenced until after the effective date, his crime took place prior to the effective date and, therefore, the statute was properly not applied to defendant. This denied defendant no vested rights and was therefore not an ex post facto application.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, the contract did not clearly advise him that he would be penalized in the event of prepayment. Respondent demurred to the complaint on the ground that appellant failed to state a cause of action based upon ambiguous, unenforceable language in a contract of adhesion. Respondent argued that as a matter of both state and federal law, that a reference to the &quot;rule of 78's&quot; constituted full, fair and unambiguous disclosure of the method of computing the unearned portion of the finance charge due the buyer upon prepayment. The trial court sustained respondent's demurrer. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the contract satisfied the statutory disclosure requirements and that the trial court did not err in concluding as a matter of law that appellant was not entitled to have the clause declared unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

At the institution, defendant was provided, and at times accepted, treatment for his mental disorder. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the petition, arguing that he was not amenable to treatment. The trial court denied the motion and tried defendant to determine whether he presently suffered from a mental disorder, whether he was presently disposed to the commission of a sex crime, and whether such predisposition presented a serious threat to others. The jury determined that defendant should remain committed. The court affirmed and held that there was sufficient evidence to show that defendant was amenable, and that if he cooperated in treatment, the condition of his mental disorder would improve. The court also held that &sect; 6316.2 was constitutional and that defendant's statements to psychiatric technicians were not privileged, so were properly admitted at trial.</SPAN></P>

Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 10210. Respondents argued that the section 10210 requirement that candidates who qualify by petition must be labeled &quot;Independent&quot; resulted in the denial of equal protection to candidates of nonqualified political parties. The court held that the provisions of section 10210 could be upheld only if appellant could demonstrate that the classifications drawn were necessary to achieve a compelling governmental interest, and this appellants could not do. The court held that by denying respondents the right to party designation enjoyed by candidates of the major political parties, the law impermissibly discouraged the growth of new political parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Community Release Board challenged a decision of the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), which granted petitioner's writ of habeas corpus and held that appellant improperly considered petitioner's two prior convictions during a serious offender hearing held pursuant to Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1976, petitioner was sentenced to prison for three counts of kidnapping, one count of attempted rape, two counts of rape, and one count of oral copulation. The information also alleged that petitioner was convicted of two counts of rape in 1960 and two counts of lewd and lascivious conduct in 1971. In the 1976 proceeding, the trial court struck the two 1971 convictions as constitutionally invalid. Appellant Community Release Board held a serious offender hearing pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170.2(b) and added three years to petitioner's term based on the 1971 convictions. Petitioner filed a writ of habeas corpus on grounds that the 1971 convictions were improperly considered. The trial court granted the writ. Appellant sought review. The court reversed the trial court because the striking of the 1971 convictions as constitutionally invalid was not the equivalent of a determination that petitioner did not suffer the convictions. Appellant was, therefore, permitted to enhance petitioner's term by use of the 1971 convictions. The prior convictions were relevant to a determination of the term necessary to protect the public from the repetition of violent crimes.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the trial court erroneously substituted its judgment for that of defendant by ordering the rezoning of the property. The court found that plaintiff did not have a cause of action for inverse condemnation because defendant had not made either a formal resolution of condemnation or taken any other official action towards acquisition of the property.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer filed a complaint against defendant, California Franchise Tax Board, for recovery of franchise taxes paid.

The court held that the net income of plaintiff was not &quot;generated&quot; at the place where merchandise was delivered but that the sales of merchandise that originated in California reflected business activity in California. The court found that the classification made in 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 381 was reasonable for determining whether sales activity should have been attributed to the receiving state or the state of origin. The court found that plaintiff had not cited any case that held unconstitutional the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act, Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 25120 et seq.

The court held that the trial court was not required to instruct the jury in the precise language requested by appellant, especially because appellant did not maintain the that the jury instruction was in error, only that his instruction was better. The court held that life imprisonment was not cruel and unusual punishment for the crime of conspiring to commit first degree murder. The court found that group criminal conduct called for enhanced punishment, and that the only offense more serious was first degree murder. The court held that given the nature of the offense and the offender, the imposition of life imprisonment was justified.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer's property was placed on the unsecured roll, but his tax rate was based upon the rate for the secured roll of the preceding year under the old statute,&nbsp;Cal.

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held the tax on plaintiff's property, on the unsecured roll, at a rate three times the one-percent rate of those on the secured roll was improper because such taxation was precluded under the new statute, which imposed a one-percent limitation and made no distinction between secured and unsecured rolls; and the new statute did not repeal by implication the old statute, because harmonization showed both statutes required equal treatment of secured and unsecured rolls.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint, holding that plaintiff was entitled only to the compensation expressly provided by statute or ordinance regardless of the extent of services actually rendered. The court commented that plaintiff had the opportunity to request an appointment to the classification of job in which he was actually working, but he did not do so. The court held that plaintiff's argument begged the question, because by the terms of his employment as statutorily defined, he was fully compensated for his services, so there was no &quot;taking.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgments of the trial court and found that the actions of respondent board were not arbitrary, in excess of discretion, or in violation of standards prescribed by law because in a regulated market like appellants where property received appraisal as a whole without reference to the value of its component parts, use of RCNLD as an absolute ceiling on the valuation of property was not necessarily appropriate. Furthermore, the court found that appellant did not present sufficient evidence that respondent board failed to deduct income that arose from enterprise activity when it used capitalization of earnings to make the property assessment. The court also found that respondent board was not bound by its prior policy of using RCNLD as a limit because the policy was never formally made into a regulation, therefore there was no need to formally repeal it, nor was the policy so well established that legislation was required to change it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant applicant was a white male that was denied admission to cross-appellant university's law school.

The trial court denied appellant's motion for leave to amend his complaint to include damages because it was unnecessarily delayed and the evidence showed that he did not otherwise qualify for admission. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and found that under the doctrine of independent state grounds cross-appellant violated the provisions of Cal.

Appellant filed an application for writ of mandamus with the trial court, and the trial court denied the application. Appellant challenged the trial court's decision, and argued that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to appellant. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court held that zoning ordinances which limit the locations of adult entertainment are a valid exercise of police power and they did not restrict or limit access to adult entertainment in the city as a whole. The court held that respondent had not retroactively applied the ordinance to appellant because appellant could not be &quot;grandfathered&quot; under the prior business license because the prior owner showed family oriented, not adult movies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant welfare recipient and husband brought an action against respondent County Department of Public Welfare after appellant husband's then estranged wife used her position as an employee of respondent to initiate a welfare fraud investigation against appellant welfare recipient for living with a then unattached male. The investigation did not lead to any formal charges, but appellants claimed respondent violated its mandatory duty to protect the confidentiality of her welfare records. The trial court found respondent had no mandatory duty. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment dismissing appellant's causes of action, but found that respondent did have a duty to protect the confidentiality of appellant's welfare records. However, the court found that the duty was to provide safeguards to restrict disclosure to the functions necessary to further respondent's duties and only prohibited disclosure of welfare records to the public. Here, respondent employee used the information to initiate an investigation within respondent department and did not disclose the information to the public, therefore respondent did not breach its mandatory duty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, county controller and tax collector, challenged an injunction issued by the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which enjoined them from computing, billing, or collecting taxes on the unsecured tax rolls at a rate in excess of that authorized in Proposition 13, Cal. Const. art. XIII A, &sect;&sect; 1, 2 (). The injunction was issued in a declaratory judgment action brought by plaintiff Board of Supervisors of San Diego County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, county controller and tax collector, announced that San Diego county would tax property on the unsecured tax rolls, including possessory interests or improvements on real property owned by another, in the manner followed in previous years, under Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 12. Plaintiff Board of Supervisors of San Diego County sought an injunction and declaratory relief, under newly enacted Proposition 13, Cal. Const. art. XIIIA, which set a maximum ad valorem tax rate on real property. The trial court granted plaintiff's request and enjoined defendants from computing, billing, or collecting taxes on the unsecured tax rolls at a rate or an assessed value in excess of that authorized in Proposition 13. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that Proposition 13 applied to property on the unsecured tax rolls. The court noted that Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 1, which was not repealed by Proposition 13, provided that all property was taxable and should be assessed at the same percentage of fair market value. Thus, defendants' use of a higher tax rate only for property on the unsecured rolls was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the injunction granted against defendants, county controller and tax collector, because the use of the previous year's tax rate by defendants would impose an impermissible burden on property subject to the unsecured roll which was discriminatory and beyond the limits allowed by Proposition 13 and the California Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California), which was rendered on a jury verdict finding appellant guilty of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily harm under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was apprehended by police while he was in his car trying to choke his victim. Appellant was convicted of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 245(a), and assault with intent to commit a felony under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 221, the felony being forcible oral copulation under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288a(c). On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and held that evidence regarding his victim's character was irrelevant to prove that appellant demanded she orally copulate him and assaulted her when she refused and was, thus, properly excluded. The court found that general intent, and not specific intent, was all that was required to be found by the jury in any assault case and that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict because the actual injury to appellant's victim was not an element of the crime. The court remanded on the issue of aggravation of appellant's sentence because he did not actually have a prior conviction. The court also remanded the case on the issue of mitigation, because the trial court apparently refused to consider letters from friends and employers written on appellant's behalf.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's convictions for assault because the evidence was sufficient to support the jury finding and the jury was properly instructed that assault was a general intent crime. The court remanded to the trial court on the issues of mitigation and aggravation because it ignored letters in support of appellant, and appellant had no previous conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision by the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California) that convicted him for robbery and kidnapping and refused to limit the total of the subordinate sentence terms in accordance with Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery and kidnapping. Essential evidence for defendant's robbery conviction was seized in a vehicle search of defendant's stolen automobile after an accident following a police chase. The appellate court found that police had probable cause to search the vehicle for weapons due to their observations and information received that the car had been involved in a shooting. In addition, due to defendant's abandonment of the vehicle, the search infringed no constitutional rights. The court examined Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170 .1 and Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667.5 and concluded that defendant was not entitled to the benefit of the five-year limitation in &sect; 1170.1(a) on the total of subordinate terms because his consecutive terms were for the violent felonies of robbery with a firearm within the definition of &sect; 667.5. However, the court did err in imposing an additional one-year term for defendant's prior convictions of robbery and kidnapping which were served as part of a continuous term of imprisonment. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and modified his sentence by striking one year from the enhancement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision not to limit the total of defendant's subordinate terms as the statute did not require limitation, but the court did modify defendant's sentence due to an error in adding an additional one-year term based on defendant's prior convictions served continuously.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state petitioned for a writ of mandate to challenge a decision of respondent, the Superior Court of Santa Cruz County (California), that committed real party in interest to a youth authority after he was convicted of first degree murder. The state claimed that a newly enacted statute could not be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Real party in interest, a minor, committed murder in the perpetration of attempted robbery. At the time, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190 fixed the penalty for first degree murder at confinement for life and did not allow a person under age 21 to be committed to the youth authority. Before trial, &sect; 190 was amended to increase the penalty for first degree murder, but to allow commitment to the youth authority. The superior court found real party in interest guilty, and in sentencing determined that old &sect; 190 applied because the harsher, newly enacted statute would operate ex post facto. The superior court, however, concluded that real party in interest was qualified for commitment to the youth authority by reason of the newly enacted &sect; 190. The state petitioned for a writ of mandate to determine the validity of the commitment to the youth authority, arguing that that statute could not be applied retroactively. The appellate court issued the writ and held that the superior court erred in committing the real party in interest to the youth authority because the new &sect; 190 increased the penalty for first degree murder and would operate post facto to real party in interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the peremptory writ of mandate should issue because the trial court erred in committing criminal real party in interest to a youth authority after he was convicted of murder. The court ruled that a newly enacted statute, which increased the penalty for first degree murder but allowed commitment to the youth authority, could not be applied because application was a violation of the prohibition against ex post fact laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant real estate commissioner challenged the judgment of the Superior Court, Alameda County (California), which awarded plaintiff claimants costs in addition to $ 20,000 in their action to satisfy an underlying judgment they obtained in a class action against defendant real estate broker for usury. Plaintiff's challenged the amount of the award. Defendant real estate broker challenged the underlying judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the underlying class action, plaintiff claimants successfully sued defendant real estate broker for charging them illegal expenses, costs, and commissions. No appeal was taken from that judgment. Unable to satisfy that judgment, plaintiffs applied for payment from defendant Real Estate Education, Research, and Recovery Fund (fund) pursuant to Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 10471. The trial court awarded plaintiffs $ 20,000 plus costs. Defendant fund appealed the award of costs. Plaintiffs challenged the amount of the award. Defendant broker challenged the validity of the underlying judgment. On appeal, the court modified the judgment and affirmed. Defendant broker could not retry issues already determined against him by the underlying judgment. Plaintiffs' recovery properly was limited to $ 20,000. Although defendant broker had three licenses, the underlying judgment was based on acts for which only one license was required, and plaintiffs' claim, filed in 1971, did not qualify for the increased limitation in Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 10474(b). The award of costs, however, was deleted. Under &sect; 10474, the amount awarded could not exceed the statutory limitation of $ 20,000.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court deleted the award of costs to plaintiff claimants and affirmed the judgment as modified. In the suit to satisfy their underlying judgment against defendant real estate broker by seeking payment from defendant Real Estate Education, Research and Recovery Fund, plaintiff's recovery was limited to $ 20,000. Defendant real estate broker could not collaterally attack the underlying action.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that, although prisoners give up some degree of privacy and rights consistent with their custodial status, prisoners do not give up all rights to privacy. In particular, the court noted that marital communications are presumed to have been made in confidence. The court found that the sole purpose of the eavesdropping was to obtain incriminating evidence, and there was no suggestion that a penological purpose was being served or that the security of a custodial institution was in any way involved. Accordingly, petitioner had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his marital communication, which was violated by the secret recording.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), which committed defendant as a Mentally Disordered Sex Offender (MDSO) pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 6316.2, in defendant's hearing and examination to determine if he was an MDSO.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with forcing a minor to copulate him orally, willfully causing a child to suffer unjustifiable physical pain, and assault with force likely to produce great bodily injury. Defendant pled guilty and the lower court adjourned criminal proceedings and certified defendant for hearing and examination to determine if he was a Mentally Disordered Sex Offender (MDSO) pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 6316.2. Defendant was found to be an MDSO and committed to mental health confinement. People moved for extension of the commitment, and the lower court appointed psychiatrists to examine defendant. Defendant was recommitted for an extended term of one year. On appeal, defendant argued that &sect; 6316.2 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed and held that it had long been recognized that a psychiatric expert's appraisal of a defendant's dangerousness was directly related to the expert's evaluation of that defendant's existing mental state. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional because it was vague and held that juries or judges would have to be convinced on case by case basis that a person poses a danger to others.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment of a one-year extension of defendant's Mentally Disordered Sex Offenders (MDSO) commitment because, under MDSO proceedings, the lower court was required to identify MDSOs with the assistance of psychiatrists. The court held that the MDSO statute was not an ex post facto law because, where legislature specified an operative date, the effective date was purely technical.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus challenging the constitutionality of the provisions of &sect; 311.2 exempting nonmanagerial employees without financial interest in their place of employment from criminal liability for exhibition of obscene matter. The court denied the writ. The supreme court issued an order to the court to show cause why the writ should not be granted. The court held the obvious purpose of &sect; 311.2 was to deter the commercial dissemination of obscene matter. In light of this legitimate purpose, the court held it could not say that a legislative classification distinguishing between the exhibition and distribution of such obscene matter by nonmanagerial employees was palpably arbitrary and without any rational basis. The court held Cal. Penal Code &sect; 311.2(c), (d), did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV; Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7; art.

The trial court entered an order finding that real party was entitled to the custody of minor and directed petitioners to surrender custody. Petitioners filed their petition seeking a prerogative writ, and a stay was entered. Real party filed an original proceeding for writ in the court. The court found that real party did not meet the statutory definition of &quot;presumed father,&quot; because he and the mother had never attempted to marry, and the child had never been in his home. The court also found that real party's due process right was not violated because he had notice and an opportunity to be heard, and that his equal protection right was not violated because the gender-based classification statute was based on an actual difference in situation. A writ issued directing respondent court to vacate its custody order and conduct a new hearing, but the adoption could be ordered without real party's consent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were union members picketing in front of a plant and the incident giving rise to the charges of falsely reporting a crime to a law enforcement officer, under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 148.5, grew out of a labor relations dispute between the striking workers and those still working. Defendants contended that a non-striking employee tried to run over one of the defendants as the employee was leaving the plant. There was contradictory testimony from the employee and a security guard that defendant actually stepped in front of the path of the truck and struck the hood with his hands. Other testimony supported the contention that defendants were harassing employees as they were leaving. The court affirmed defendants' conviction and held that even if the employee failed to yield to a pedestrian walking on the sidewalk in violation of Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 21952, the reporting of such violation did not insulate defendants from liability since the other reported violation of assault did not occur. The court concluded that &sect; 148.5 did not infringe upon defendants' privilege against self-incrimination, did not punish honest mistakes and was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant district attorney filed petitions seeking the institutionalization of respondent mentally retarded persons. The petitions alleged that each was developmentally disabled and could not provide for their basic needs.

Welf. &amp; Inst.  &sect;&sect; 4803 and 4825 provided for institutionalization of mentally retarded persons without a judicial hearing.

The court affirmed, holding that the procedure for institutionalization outlined in Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect;&sect; 48- 3 and 4825 violated the due process rights of respondents.

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c12">8&nbsp;The Kahns argue that it appears from the record that the statute of limitations had expired on any alleged Penal Code section 632 violation.  This argument is based upon the allegations of the first amended complaint, filed in November 1976, to the effect that the alleged recordings occurred between 1964 and July 19, 1974.  While the first amended complaint alleges also that plaintiff did not discover the recordation until April 30, 1976, the Kahns argue that allegation is belied by a letter dated June 27, 1974, from plaintiff to Melvin Kahn, which was submitted with Melvin Kahn's declaration in support of a motion for summary judgment, and which makes reference to &quot;numerous recordings . . . surreptitiously made.&quot; Thus, the Kahns argue that plaintiff had knowledge of the recordings at least by June 27, 1974, and that the action was therefore barred by the one-year period of limitations prescribed both for actions upon a statute for penalty or forfeiture (Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 340, subd. 1) and for general tort actions (Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 340, subd. 3).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c12">Since this argument was not raised in the trial court, and involves a potential factual issue, its consideration on appeal would be inappropriate.  We note for the guidance of the trial court on remand, however, that respondents are correct in contending that the action is one to recover a &quot;statutory penalty or forfeiture&quot; within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision 1.

The trial court granted defendant's motion to strike plaintiff's second amended complaint and dismissed plaintiff's first amended complaint. Upon review, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held plaintiff's second amended complaint was improper because it stated entirely new and different causes of action. The court held plaintiff's first complaint sufficiently stated a cause against defendant client under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 632 where he alleged defendant recorded confidential phone calls without the consent of plaintiff. The court found the test for determining whether the conversations were confidential under Cal.

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiff. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 602 was unconstitutional where the government did not have a compelling interest because the interest behind the act was to prevent potential for corruption implicit in contributions, and there was no such interest with regard to issue-oriented committees. The court reasoned there was a tighter nexus between a contributor and a one issue-organization, and that there was a greater likelihood the contribution would not be used as the contributor wishes than with the attenuated relationship between a contributor and a political candidate who was obliged to take a position on more than one issue. The court found that &sect; 602 was a direct and substantial restriction on plaintiffs' rights of free speech and association because it employed means that were unnecessarily broad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Humboldt County (California), which sentenced him to imprisonment after a jury found him guilty of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 245(a). He contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence in the form of a letter written to a friend while he was detained in jail awaiting trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While in jail awaiting trial for attacking a fellow patron in a bar, appellant wrote a letter to a friend describing the events. His motion to suppress the letter was denied, as were his evidentiary objections to admission of the letter. The court affirmed the judgment, rejecting appellant's argument that the letter should have been suppressed. The court held that the jailer's actions did not violate appellant's First Amendment rights because the letter was copied under a county program to monitor all incoming and outgoing prisoner mail, consistent with U.S. Supreme Court precedent. The letter was copied for a proper purpose because it offered to provide a county jail inmate with a pistol. Appellant's U.S. Const. amend. IV claim lacked merit, and the court held that a prisoner generally had no expectation of privacy as to letters posted by him. The copy of the letter was properly admitted under an exception to the best evidence rule because the original was shown to be unavailable. The admission of part of the letter's contents after the defense rested was within the trial court's discretion in reopening the prosecution's case in chief pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1094.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the interception of the letter by the jailer under a county program for monitoring all inmate mail did not violate appellant's First Amendment rights or his Fourth Amendment rights, because a prisoner generally had no reasonable expectation of privacy as to letters mailed in prison. Appellant's evidentiary arguments as to the letter were also held by the court to be without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant marijuana users filed suit for declaratory injunctive relief against respondent police chief. The action sought a declaration that California Health and Safety Code sections that prohibited the private possession and use of marijuana were unconstitutional. Respondent attorney general intervened and filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted by the trial court. Appellants sought review, arguing that the Health and Safety Code sections violated appellants' constitutional rights of privacy, equal protection, due process, pursuit of happiness, and protection against cruel and unusual punishment. The court affirmed, holding that the right of privacy as set forth in Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 1 did not guarantee the privilege of smoking marijuana, even in the privacy of the home. The court further stated that the equal protection argument did not have merit because the legislature had a rational basis for determining that marihuana was harmful. The court also stated that it could not rule on whether statutes that set forth penalties for marijuana use constituted cruel and unusual punishment because such a determination was only used when punishment was imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant nightclub operators took issue with the judgment of the Superior Court of San Mateo County (California), which ordered appellants' nightclub closed pursuant to the Red Light Abatement Act, Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 11225- 35. Appellants made several contentions of reversible error on appeal, including that the abatement order amounted to a prior restraint on their First Amendment right to free expression.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant nightclub operators appealed from an order closing their nightclub, which featured pornographic films, nude dancing, hired female companionship, and public masturbation, as a public nuisance under the Red Light Abatement Act, Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 11225- 35. On appeal, the court affirmed, rejecting each of appellants' arguments. The trial court's failure to make the essential finding that the acts on the premises were lewd was not reversible, because had the court made such a formal finding it would have been adverse to appellants based on the evidence. No finding of specific intent to perform a sexual act was required in an equitable public nuisance proceeding. Nor were appellants entitled to a jury trial in a proceeding to abate a public nuisance. The order of abatement did not infringe on appellants' U.S. Const. amend. I rights as a prior restraint, because such interference was a reasonable exercise of the state's police power pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 11230. Finally, the court found unpersuasive appellants' contention that the abatement order was overbroad, holding that closure for one year was neither inherently unreasonable nor an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that the abatement order was a reasonable exercise of the state's police power and did not improperly infringe upon appellant nightclub operators' First Amendment rights. The court held that the trial court had broad discretion to fashion appropriate remedies to abate public nuisances, and given the abundant evidence in the record in the case, the trial court did not abuse that discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant agency commenced an eminent domain proceeding on respondent landowner's property upon which appellant corporation was a lessee. Appellant corporation appealed the proceeding to request compensation for loss of business good will. Appellant agency also appealed when attorney fees were awarded to respondent when appellant agency sought a court order to inspect the property. On the joinder of appeals, the court held that appellant corporation was not entitled to compensation for loss of business good will because the legislation that provided for this type of compensation precluded proceedings commenced prior to 1976 and appellant corporation's proceeding began in 1975. The court found the legislation was constitutionally justified as an economic regulation and in compliance with the rational relationship test. The court also held that appellant agency had substantially interfered with respondent's business when it conducted an unannounced inspection of the property that the subsequent court order was protective in nature to prevent further interference and as such, respondent was entitled to attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying appellant corporation compensation for loss of business good will in an eminent domain proceeding was affirmed because new legislation precluded the compensation and was constitutionally justified, and the order awarding respondent attorney fees was affirmed because the court order sought by appellant agency was protective in nature due to appellant agency's past interference with respondent business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and committed to a mental health facility as a mentally disordered sex offender. Before the expiration of defendant's initial term, proceedings were instituted to extend defendant's commitment period and the lower court recommitted defendant for an additional year. Defendant appealed, claiming that amenability to treatment was a prerequisite to his term extension and that the evidence was insufficient to show that defendant could benefit from further treatment. The court held that a proper interpretation of the extension statute in conjunction with the original commitment statute led to the constitutionally sound result that a prerequisite existed to determine whether defendant would benefit from treatment before extending his commitment term. The court also found that evidence indicated defendant would not benefit from further treatment as facility psychiatrists reported that defendant would continue to be a danger to society and his minimal improvements in the past year were due to the institutional environment of the facility rather than the facility treatments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order extending defendant's term commitment as a mentally disordered sex offender was reversed on the grounds that proper statutory interpretation called for the prerequisite finding that defendant would benefit from further treatment prior to extending defendant's commitment term in a mental health facility and the evidence did not show that defendant would so benefit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When petitioner inmates killed a state correctional officer while they were incarcerated, they were charged under former Cal. Penal Code &sect; 4500. After an initial mistrial and a subsequent reversal on unrelated grounds, petitioners filed a motion for an order determining that &sect; 4500 was unconstitutional. When respondent superior court denied their motion, petitioners sought a writ of mandate. On review, the court observed that former &sect; 4500 had since been amended to provide for an alternative punishment of life without parole. The court held that because the real party in interest, the state, had failed to establish that only death was an adequate penalty of malicious assault on a noninmate by a life prisoner and former &sect; 4500 failed to provide for the consideration of mitigating factors, the statute as it existed at the time of petitioners' crime was unconstitutional. The court further held that the punishment provisions of the amended version of &sect; 4500 could not be applied to petitioners retroactively. Thus, the court issued a writ ordering respondent court to proceed on the basis that the death penalty could not be imposed for the offenses with which petitioners were charged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband disputed the denial of his motion to vacate a judgment entered by the clerk under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect;&sect; 1710.15 and 1710.25. On appeal, the court held that there was no valid constitutional objection to the procedure to enter a judgment based on that of a sister state because, before the judgment was effective through execution to divest appellant of any assets, he had the right to nullify the effect of the sister state's judgment in this state in the same fashion by which he could file an action in this state upon the sister state judgment to establish it. Respondent wife's failure to give notice did not deny appellant due process, because his time to move to vacate the judgment ran from the date of service of the notice. Under Cal. Evid. Code &sect;&sect; 459 and 455, the court took judicial notice of the proceedings in the sister state and held that appellant had voluntarily appeared and participated in those proceedings. Therefore, the trial court's finding that the sister state judgment was not void was correct. Appellant was not prejudiced by the trial court's erroneous failure to make findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs filed an action to have the sale set aside, to quiet title, and to recover damages, and filed a notice of lis pendens. Defendant demurred. The court affirmed the superior court's order that sustained defendant's demurrer. The court concluded that jurisdiction of the matter remained in the federal court, not the state court, under 11 U.S.C.S. &sect; 511. The court found that plaintiffs had failed to join the bankruptcy trustee, who was an indispensable party, and that the complaint was barred by res judicata because the federal court had already dismissed an identical action. The grant of the motion to expunge the notice of lis pendens was not appealable under Cal. Civ. Proc. &sect; 409.4.

Respondent was an Ohio corporation doing business in the state of California, with its principle office in Ohio. The taxes imposed by appellant, the taxing board for the state, were claimed to be excessive by respondent. The amount of taxes imposed by Ohio on a California corporation doing business there, was more than the amount of taxes imposed by California on a foreign corporation. Respondent was then charged a retaliatory tax equal to the difference between the two. The trial court ruled that this retaliatory tax was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner filed an action against defendant park department for inverse condemnation when it began action to purchase her ocean front property but did not directly condemn it and refused her applications for permits to develop it. When plaintiff was awarded substantial damages at trial, defendant appealed, contending her cause of action for inverse condemnation was improper and the damage award was excessive. Plaintiff counter-appealed on the issue of postjudgment interest and litigation expenses. The court agreed with defendant and reversed the judgment, holding that defendant had the right to use temporary regulatory measures to preserve plaintiff's coastal land from development pending the adoption of a comprehensive land use plan, such as the park envisioned by defendant. The court found that defendant's actions were consistent with Cal. Pub. Res.

Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11352(a), and the true finding of an allegation under Cal.

VIII and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 17. The court found that the ban on probation was not so disproportionate as to be unconstitutional where the offense was a serious one, California law had not singled out heroin sellers for disproportionate punishment where probation was also denied by law to a broad range of offenders, and 12 other states denied probation under similar circumstances. Thus, the court affirmed the convictions, but found that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that one of the defendants was not fit for commitment to the California Rehabilitation Center (CRC) under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 3051 because it applied factors other than the defendant's excessive criminality. The court remanded for the trial court to reconsider the CRC issue.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and held that the lower court incorrectly construed a contract between respondent's predecessor in interest and the county. The court held that, based on the express terms of the contract, the parties' conduct, and extrinsic evidence, the county's rights under the contract included the right to regulate rates and was not limited to an entitlement to license fees. The court noted that this right passed to appellants when they were later incorporated within the county's geographic area. The court held that the agreement was binding on respondent, and thus appellants' attempts to regulate respondent's rates neither unconstitutionally impaired respondent's contract nor offended public policy. The court remanded for the lower court to determine whether appellants had in fact assumed, retained, and effectively exercised the right to regulate rates.</SPAN></P>

Defendants contended that Cal Penal Code &sect;&sect; 4002, 4021 and 4029 mandated complete separation of men and women in county jails, and that equal treatment required deferral until receipt of funds was provided by the Legislature. The trial court held that defendants had denied female inmates as a class the equal protection of the law as mandated by Cal. Const. art. I. &sect; 7 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent owners filed an action to set aside a treasurer's deed executed in favor of appellant purchaser following foreclosure of a street improvement assessment lien on respondents' property pursuant to the provisions of the Improvement Act of 1911, Cal. Sts. &amp; High. Code &sect; 5000 et seq. Respondents did not have actual or constructive notice of the proceedings leading to issuance of the treasurer's deed. The trial court quieted title in favor of respondents. On appeal, the court concluded that although respondents' claim was not filed within the six month period of limitation under Cal. Sts. &amp; High. Code &sect; 6571, the action was not time-barred because respondents did not have notice of the proceedings leading to the application for a treasurer's deed's or appellant's application for a deed. The court found that the notice provisions of &sect; 6571 were inadequate on their face and were not reasonably calculated to clearly and fairly apprise the homeowner of the pending sale proceedings or of the right to redemption.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent employee was hired by appellant county as a mental health assistant. Pursuant to provisions of appellant's charter, respondent was informed that she would have to file proof of United States citizenship or of having filed a petition for naturalization in order to continue to receive compensation. Upon her failure to do so, she was given notice of termination. The trial court granted respondent a peremptory writ of mandate ordering appellant to reinstate respondent to her previously held employment position, together with associated benefits, and awarded her back pay with interest. On appeal, the court affirmed the writ. The court held, contrary to appellant's argument, that respondent's position did not meet either the special public interest or governmental function exceptions to the general rule that U.S. Const. amend. XIV prohibits employment discrimination against aliens. The exceptions apply only if the requirement of citizenship bears a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest. Because of its affirmance of the writ, the court did not address respondent's argument regarding federal preemption in the field of alien admission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, mother and her children, appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), which denied their petition for writ of mandamus to compel defendant Director of the California Department of Benefit Payments to set aside his decision finding them ineligible for aid to families with dependent children pursuant to 45 C.F.R. &sect; 232.10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Director of the California Department of Benefit Payments denied plaintiffs, mother and her children, aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) because plaintiff mother failed to provide the social security numbers (SSNs) for plaintiff children as required by 45 C.F.R. &sect; 232.10. Plaintiff mother cited religious reasons for her refusal to obtain the SSNs. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment denying plaintiffs' petition for writ of mandamus. The interpretation of the phrase &quot;applicant for or recipient of aid&quot; in 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 602(a)(25) to include the AFDC child was not erroneous. The court held that &sect; 232.10 did not violate the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C.S. &sect; 552a, because the act did not apply to disclosure of SSNs required by statute. Equal protection was not implicated because plaintiff children, whose eligibility for AFDC was foreclosed by their failure to furnish SSNs, were not within the class of persons for whom protective payments were authorized. The state's interest in maintaining the fiscal integrity of the AFDC system was sufficiently compelling to counterbalance the infringement of plaintiff mother's free exercise of religion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a pastor and members of his congregation, appealed from a summary judgment in favor of plaintiff city entered by the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which found that defendants' households constituted a public nuisance and ordered them to come into full compliance with plaintiff's ordinances governing R-1 zones within 60 days from the date of the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a matter of their religious belief, defendants, a pastor and members of his congregation, lived in 12 communal arrangements in plaintiff city. These religious households violated plaintiff's zoning ordinance because they consisted of more than 3 and up to 20 unrelated people living together. On appeal, the court found that the zoning ordinance did not violate defendants' freedom of religion under U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV or Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 4. The court reasoned that the ordinance did not encourage or discourage a religious belief or opinion and did not impinge upon a fundamental right. The court found that the zoning ordinance was at most an incidental restraint on a practice of a secular hue that had to be weighed against the interest of plaintiff in protecting the safety and quality of life in its community. Although the court found no constitutional violation, it did conclude that a factual issue existed as to defendants' claim of discretionary, arbitrary treatment of their applications for conditional use permits, and therefore summary judgment on that issue was improper. Therefore, the court reversed and remanded the judgment on that ground only.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in favor of plaintiff city to the extent that it granted summary judgment on the issue of whether plaintiff acted improperly in denying conditional use permits but otherwise affirmed the judgment because it found that the zoning ordinance did not unconstitutionally impinge on the religious freedom of defendants, a pastor and members of his congregation.</SPAN></P>

The lower court held that the tax for water usage was constitutional and the territory annexed to a municipal corporation or district was liable to pay its proportionate share of the existing indebtedness of the corporation or district to which it was annexed. Defendant contended on appeal that the tax was unconstitutional, pursuant to Cal. Const. art. XIII A, &sect; 5, because an indebtedness on outstanding bonds existed before the property was annexed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant civil service commission refused to accept respondent applicant's application for employment solely on the basis that respondent did not satisfy the city's one-year residential requirement pursuant to San Francisco Administrative Code &sect; 16.98(a). The trial court held the ordinance unconstitutional in violation of the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitution. The court affirmed and held that the term &quot;employees&quot; as used by Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 10(b), which prohibited chartered cities from requiring that employees be residents of the cities in which they worked, included applicants based on the historical context of the amendment. Thus, the court noted that the ordinance was contravened by Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 10(b) and disposed of the appeal. Because the ordinance impinged on two fundamental rights, the right to intrastate travel and the right to apply for public service positions without invidious discrimination, the court further held it unconstitutional as appellant failed to demonstrate a compelling state interest in the classification it made, and was unable to prove that no less intrusive means would have achieved the same result.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner parolee sought a writ of habeas corpus for review of the decision of the Department of Corrections (California), which refused to honor his previously-set release date, and extended his parole supervision pursuant to provisions of the amended determinate sentencing law, which set the maximum statutory period of parole for confinement pursuant to parole violation from eighteen months to three years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner parolee was convicted and sentenced to six months to fourteen years pursuant to the indeterminate sentencing law (ISL). He was paroled in 1976, violated parole and was re-incarcerated in January 1978, pursuant to the newly-operative determinate sentencing law (DSL), which allowed a maximum confinement of six months for parole violations. After the second parole, he violated parole, and again was returned to prison in April 1978. He was paroled a third time in September 1978 with a scheduled parole discharge date in February 1979, since the DSL mandated that he could only be retained under supervision for a maximum of 18 months. However, the parole provisions were amended by 1978 Cal. Stat. ch. 582, p. 2002, which increased the maximum statutory parole violation period from six to twelve months. Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus on the grounds of the ex post facto application of the amended DSL. The court granted the application for habeas corpus, and held that the DSL was ex post facto as applied because petitioner had a vested right to be discharged from parole supervision after the 18 month period applicable to ISL offenders paroled under the DSL.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner parolee's request for a writ of habeas corpus was granted, and he was held entitled to discharge, because the court ruled that as applied to his situation, the amended parole provisions of the determinate sentencing law had a constitutionally-impermissible ex post facto effect.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendant's motion, and defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere to the crime charged. On appeal, defendant again challenged the validity of the untimely warrant. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and held that the return of the warrant one day beyond the maximum set forth in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1534, though a defect, did not prejudice defendant and did not require suppression of any evidence. The court found that the procedural requirements of Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 1534, 1537 were essentially ministerial in nature. Therefore, the court concluded that an untimely return of an otherwise validly executed search warrant should result in the suppression of evidence only if the accused demonstrates he was prejudiced by the delay in returning the warrant.</SPAN></P>

The trial court decided the issues of interpretation and constitutionality against appellant. The court affirmed, holding that the language of &sect; 8602 clearly and unambiguously provided that the length of any net meshes was to be measured by taking four meshes while they were simultaneously drawn together. The court noted that the statute's interpretation was supported by its legislative history as well as contemporaneous and practical construction of the statute. The court ruled that such extrinsic evidence was highly relevant to show the legislative intent underlying the statute and therefore admissible. The court further held that the statute's ambiguity, if any, was dispelled by respondent's contemporaneous construction of &sect; 8062 and, thus, the statute was not found to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendants, the City of Los Angeles, board of police commissioners, police chief, and city attorney appealed. The ordinance required a permit for the operation of a picture arcade, and stated that a permit would be denied if, within the past two years, the applicant, his employee, agent, partner, director, officer, stockholder, or manager had knowingly allowed any act of sexual intercourse, sodomy, oral copulation, or masturbation to be committed in any arcade. The court reversed, and held that the ordinance was an unconstitutional prior restraint in violation of the First Amendment. However, injunctive relief was improper because plaintiffs did not show that they would be irreparably injured by enforcement of the ordinance pending trial. The court held that &sect; 103.101(i), which prohibited closed or concealed booths, was a valid, reasonable regulation of the manner of arcade operation and was not preempted by state law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged a decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), that convicted and imposed sentences for attempted murder in violation of Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants took the victim, and while one remained in his car, the other defendant, together with another accused took the victim down a hill to a vacant lot where they shot him and left him for dead. Defendants were charged with attempted murder, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 664 and Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187. The trial court convicted defendants and sentenced them to various prison terms. Defendant who participated in shooting the victim contended that his crime, if any, was assault with intent to commit murder in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 217 and that he should be sentenced pursuant to that provision. Defendant who remained in his car contended that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, and that his conviction should have been for assault with intent to commit murder. The court affirmed defendants' convictions, but remanded the cases for resentencing. The court held that if defendants were guilty of any attempted murder, they were guilty only of assault with intent to commit murder, which was a form of attempted murder. Thus, the court ruled that punishment should have been imposed pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 217.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that convicted defendants of attempted murder. The court, however, remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing under the provision of the California Penal Code that dealt with assault with intent to commit murder. The court held that if defendants were guilty of any attempted murder, they were guilty of assault with intent to commit murder, which was a form of attempted murder.</SPAN></P>

The court held that respondents' free speech rights were not violated and the state could insure that the stream of commercial information flow cleanly as well as freely. Further, the court held that the statutory violations were to be determined by the number of people to whom the misrepresentations were made.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff nonexempt lenders, defendant state, defendant attorney general, and intervenor exempt lenders all appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which determined that California's Usury Law, Cal. Const. art. XV, was unconstitutional as applied to &quot;nonconsumer loans&quot; and constitutional in all other respects, and held that the judgment had prospective effect only.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that California's Usury Law, Cal. Const. art. XV, was constitutional as applied to all loans. Accordingly, the court reversed the judgment below insofar as it held that California's Usury Law was unconstitutional as to &quot;nonconsumer loans&quot; and affirmed the judgment insofar as it held the law constitutional in all other respects. The court determined that plaintiff nonexempt lenders' equal protection challenge to the subject law was without merit because the validity of Cal. Const. art. XV had been upheld against such an attack by the state supreme court, which was a persuasive and definitive holding that was binding on the instant court. The court then rejected plaintiffs' assertion that the California Usury Law was unconstitutional under the commerce clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, because the usury laws created an unusual burden on and discrimination against interstate commerce, and there were reasonable alternatives available that defendant state had to utilize. The court concluded that there was no violation of the commerce clause, noting that Congress had made it clear that it recognized the validity of state usury laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court partially reversed the judgment below in order to overturn the holding that California's Usury Law was unconstitutional as to &quot;nonconsumer loans&quot; and affirmed the remainder of the judgment, which had upheld the validity of the law in all other respects. The state usury law, which was recognized by Congress, was not subject to a valid attack under either the equal protection or commerce clauses of the federal Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that the trial court made several errors in evidentiary rulings and was biased. The court disagreed and upheld the convictions against various challenges to evidentiary rulings. The court reversed appellant's conviction on two counts that were not included in amended indictment. And, the court found error, albeit harmless, where the trial court threatened to fire a defense investigator if he were put on the stand to contradict testimony. Although the investigator was ultimately allowed to testify, the court said that such an order, had it been enforced, was tantamount to ordering that the defense could not put on its defense. The court also found that the punishment of life imprison was properly assessed.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court vacated respondent's order dismissing the &sect; 602 petition and directed respondent to issue a peremptory writ of mandate compelling the juvenile court to dismiss the petition under &sect; 300(c). The court found that the finding of not guilty by reason of insanity on a &sect; 602 petition did not deprive the juvenile court of the power to make a valid commitment order under &sect; 702.3. Further, under &sect; 702.3, minor could be committed until he was sane, because minor was convicted and then found not guilty by reason of insanity.

Petitioner brought a writ of habeas corpus and complained that the board had fixed his sentence contrary to statute. Petitioner contended that under the statute, the &quot;being armed&quot; enhancement provision only applied if petitioner himself was personally armed. The court denied the writ of habeas corpus and held that &sect; 1170.2(a), authorized such enhancement if petitioner was armed as specified in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 211(a), prior to July 1, 1977. Prior to that date &sect; 211(a), provided that all robbery perpetrated by a person being armed with a deadly weapon was robbery in the first degree. Judicial precedent also provided that if any one of a group of perpetrators was armed, all were deemed to have been armed and were guilty of first degree robbery.

The trial court held that the ordinance was arbitrary, capricious, and unconstitutional, and awarded plaintiff costs and attorney fees available under Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 800. Defendant appealed from only that portion of the judgment awarding plaintiff attorney fees. On appeal, the court held that Burbank, Cal., Municipal Code &sect; 7-33, subd. (c)(3) prohibited the relocation of any building which was over 15 years old. The ordinance was applied to plaintiff's application for relocation and resulted in a denial of the application. The court held that application of the ordinance constituted arbitrary or capricious action by a public entity, and allowed imposition of attorney fees pursuant to Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 800. The denial of plaintiff's residential-structure-removal application fell within the concept of arbitrary and capricious conduct, as conduct not supported by a fair or substantial reason or as a stubborn insistence on following an unauthorized course of action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prison officials refused to publish certain articles in the prison newspaper. After his three administrative appeals were denied, respondent inmate petitioned for writ of mandate. The trial court granted the petition and ordered appellants to permit the publication and to enact guidelines for censorship and prompt review. Appellants challenged the order, asserting respondent's failure to exhaust administrative remedies and the overbreadth of the order. The court affirmed, finding that respondent had used every available administrative remedy before seeking judicial relief. It ruled that appellants' guidelines for publication were overly broad because they conferred too much discretion on prison officials to suppress criticism and controversial views which presented no threat to the security interests of the prison. The trial court properly ordered appellants to enact new guidelines limiting censorship pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 2600, 2601 (c) and to set new rules for expeditious review of censored articles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on regulations prohibiting certain behavioral modification techniques involving the infliction of corporal punishment, defendant health department revoked plaintiff school's license as a community care facility for autistic and schizophrenic children and refused its applications for additional licenses. After the trial court directed an issuance of a peremptory writ which ordered defendant to set aside the license revocation and reconsider the applications, defendant appealed. In reversing, the court held that Cal. Code Regs. tit. 9 &sect; 152 and Cal. Code Regs. tit. 22 &sect; 80341, which defined and prohibited corporal punishment, were not vague and unenforceable and did not violate the constitutional rights of the children or their parents. The court further determined that the motive or intent of plaintiff in imposing corporal punishment on the children did not make its actions permissible under those sections. Additionally, the court concluded that in view of the trial court's specific findings of fact that certain acts amounting to corporal punishment took place, the judgment was based on the erroneous assumption that such acts were not proscribed by &sect;&sect; 152 and 80341.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, teachers association and a teacher, challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Orange County (California) that denied a writ of mandate to compel respondent school district to pay certificated associate teachers the difference between the salary they received under a staffing exemption under 1970 Cal. Stat. ch. 966 and the salary received for a full-time certificated teacher as required by Cal. Educ. Code &sect;45028.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to 1970 Cal. Stat. ch. 966, respondent school district had a salary schedule for associate certificated teachers not on the basis of years of training and experience, as provided in Cal. Educ. Code &sect;45028, but by job specification. The associate teachers were subject to a lesser salary because they were assigned by respondent to different work conditions from full-time certificated teachers. Appellants, teachers association and a teacher, asserted that certificated teachers worked beyond the minimum school day provided in the Cal. Educ. Code and were full-time teachers pursuant to Cal. Educ. Code 45024, and ch. 966 did not allow a different salary structure as to full-time employees. The court held that ch. 966 was applicable because &sect;45024 allowed a longer minimum day and associate teachers worked a minimum five hour day while full-timers worked a seven and one-half hour day. The court also rejected appellants' argument that the ch. 966 exemption was applicable only if one salary schedule for all teachers was implemented based upon job classification, as this defeated the legislative intent of ch. 966 that allowed flexible salary schedules to meet educational goals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that denied appellants, teachers association and a teacher, a writ of mandate to compel respondent school district to pay certificated associate teachers the difference between the salary they received under a staffing exemption and that of the salary of full-time certificated teachers because the different salaries were proper under the legislative scheme.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended the trial court erred in not providing him good time/work time credit and in instructing the jury to consider his consciousness of guilt from an inconsistent pretrial statement and from evidence of flight after the offense. Appellant sought review and the court affirmed the convictions, finding that the jury instructions were appropriate because the evidence indicated appellant made a pretrial statement to a police officer concerning his alibi that differed from his in court testimony and the testimony of a witness clearly indicated appellant fled the scene after the offense. The court determined that such evidence could be considered by the jury in considering appellant's consciousness of guilt. The court modified appellant's sentence to allow good time/work time credit for his presentence detention. The court construed Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought class action suits against defendant retail department stores and defendant gasoline companies challenging the validity of their various charge account practices. Defendants charged from 1 percent to 1 1/2 percent per month on plaintiffs' unpaid balances after certain periods of time. The per month charges exceeded the 10 percent rate of interest used in the state constitutional provision relating to usury. The trial court vacated the interlocutory class certification order entered in plaintiffs' action against one of the gasoline company defendants, dismissed the complaints in all the actions, and awarded judgment to defendants. Plaintiffs appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The revolving charge accounts were validly classified as subject to the time-price doctrine. They were not loans or forbearance of money and thus not subject to the usury laws. Defendants' credit card sales were within the meaning of the Unruh Act, Cal. Civ. Code, 1801 et seq., which the court upheld as constitutional. Because there was no cause of action against defendant gasoline company, the trial court did not err in vacating the class certification order in that action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision that defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law because defendants' credit card sales were not subject to state usury laws. In light of the fact that plaintiffs could state no cause of action against any of defendants, the trial court's order vacating plaintiffs' class certification in its action against one of defendants was not erroneous.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 68203, which placed a five percent cap on cost-of-living increases on judicial salaries and pensions of respondent judges and judicial pensioners, was unconstitutional. The court reversed the judgment of the lower court. The court held that the cap on cost-of-living increases for judicial salaries and pensions was valid except to the extent that it purported to eliminate a salary increase for respondent sitting judges based on the cost of living during the current year. Respondent judicial pensioners were to continue to receive pensions tied to the current judicial salaries. As to future salary increases, the court held that because the salaries and pensions were set by public law rather than by contract, no officer or employee had an immutable vested right to any specific salary. Failure to receive an increase of salary did not constitute a reduction such as would trigger the Cal. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant organizations challenged an order of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), authorizing the implementation of state legislation that restricted funding for certain elective abortions. Appellants contended that such restrictions violated the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, health care rights persons and organizations, brought a complaint to challenged implementation of the state's budget act of 1978, which restricted the circumstances under which public funds would be authorized for elective abortions for indigent women. Prior to the passage of the act, funds were available generally for all abortions. The court determined that the act did not infringe on the equal protection of the qualified recipients because the restrictions on the abortion funding were rationally related to the state's strong interest in protecting the potential life of the fetus, and in encouraging normal childbirth. However, it ruled that the act violated the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396 et seq. The court held that the state act would not fund certain abortions, which would otherwise be funded under the federal scheme, where severe and long-lasting physical health damage to the mother would result if a pregnancy were carried to term. The court reversed and remanded with directions that implementation of the act be enjoined only to the extent necessary to comply with the federal statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court to the extent necessary to conform to federal law. The court held that the state legislation was invalid to the extent that it prohibited state reimbursement for certain abortions that would qualify for federal reimbursement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Ventura County (California), which denied defendant's motion to set aside a child support order and paternity decree that was based on an agreement between defendant and respondent county. Defendant argued that Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 11476.1 deprived defendant of due process of law because it authorized entry of judgment without notice and hearing, or adequate waiver thereof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered into an agreement with the district attorney's office for respondent county, which provided for entry of a child support order and paternity decree for a child born out of wedlock. Six months later, defendant moved to set aside the agreement and judgment pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 473, but the court denied it. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to vacate the agreement and judgment. The court noted that a judgment entered pursuant to a confession is constitutional only if the confession constitutes a valid waiver of the debtor's due process rights. Defendant was not advised that he could be subject to criminal prosecution for failure to support the child as ordered, nor that the existence of a judgment establishing paternity would be admissible as evidence on that issue in any subsequent support action. Because the statute did not contain adequate safeguards to assure that defendant's rights to due process were properly waived, the court held that the agreement and judgment entered pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 11476.1 was constitutionally defective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the statute authorizing entry of paternity judgments and child support orders without notice and hearing, or adequate waiver thereof, was unconstitutional. Therefore, the order denying defendant's motion to set aside the judgment was reversed and the cause remanded with directions to enter an order granting defendant's motion setting aside the agreement for the entry of judgment, and the judgment.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 187, while armed with a deadly weapon with a blade longer than five inches. In reviewing the grand jury selection, the court concluded that in the absence of a cognizable group at who unconstitutional practices are directed, no improprieties could exist. The court continued that the less educated, low income, blue-collar workers, and young adult groups were not cognizable. The court determined that the search warrant met the probable cause standard because the affidavit contained sufficient foundational circumstances to support its validity. The court also found that defendant was not denied the right to a reasonable examination of prospective jurors because the trial court conducted extensive and pertinent questioning. The court found no violation of any reasonable expectation of privacy because defendant failed to show that he had reason to believe his communications were confidential and would remain private and there was no deprivation of rights of an incarcerated person, which were not justified by a legitimate penological objective. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The order of the superior court is reversed.  The court is directed to enter a new order denying plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction except to the extent that the motion seeks to enjoin application of section 1210, 1211, 1212, and 1213 of Los Angeles County Ordinance No. 11516.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant County of Los Angeles sought review of an order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), that restrained and enjoined display restrictions and impounding provisions in a previously invalid news rack ordinance that had been more narrowly drawn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff news rack operator sought to enjoin enforcement of a narrowly drawn news rack law enacted by defendant, County of Los Angeles. The trial court issued a preliminary injunction that restrained enforcement of display restrictions and enjoined impounding provisions in the ordinance. On appeal, the court held that the ordinance did not violate the free speech and press guarantees in U.S. Const. amend. I, and was not preempted by state law. The display provisions that restricted sexually explicit materials were specific, and not indefinite, because dissemination was allowed, but displays that were used intentionally to exploit sexually explicit material to a &quot;captive&quot; public were limited. Because the &quot;captive&quot; viewer problem was a significant local interest that could differ between localities, the validity of the local ordinance was favored against an attack of state preemption. The enforcement provisions that permitted impounding were a constitutionally defective scheme to force payment of fees irrespective of the propriety of news rack seizure. Accordingly, the order was reversed, with directions for a preliminary injunction to issue as to the enforcement provisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The preliminary injunction that restrained the display and enforcement provisions in the ordinance enacted by defendant County of Los Angeles was reversed except with respect to the impounding provisions. The display provisions represented constitutionally valid time, place, and manner regulation of protected speech and press and were not preempted by state law. The constitutionally invalid enforcement provisions were properly enjoined.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was an indigent who sustained a municipal court imposition of a $ 65 fine relative to a traffic violation and the failure to appear on that violation. Defendant appealed to the superior court and sought appointment of counsel at public expense on that appeal. The superior court denied the request, and the court ordered the matter transferred under Cal. R. Ct. 62 for consideration. The court determined that defendant was not constitutionally entitled to counsel at the public expense on appeal from a misdemeanor traffic offense, which carried with it a $ 65 fine and penalty. The court ruled that, while counsel at the public expense was a right on appeals in felony cases and in misdemeanor cases resulting in sentences of imprisonment, such a right to counsel on appeal did not exist on misdemeanor cases where the fine imposed was not substantial. The court reasoned that the state was not constitutionally required to protect against every consequence of indigency, and that such a right to counsel would result in a flood of appeals that would be beyond the capacity of the courts to handle.</SPAN></P>

Appellee conducted a business through which he ascertained available residential rental units, compiled a list of said units, and advertised and sold the list for a fee. This conduct put appellee in the class of advance fee rental agent and, as such, required an active real estate license under regulations implemented by the Real Estate Commissioner. Because appellee violated this requirement, appellant, Department of Real Estate, revoked appellee's inactive real estate license. Appellee challenged that ruling and, on appeal, the trial court reversed and held that the conduct at issue was not cause for discipline. Appellant challenged the trial court ruling. On appeal, the court affirmed on constitutional grounds. The court held that the regulation at issue, while valid on its face, failed to bear a rational relationship to a valid governmental purpose. Because only licensed agents could provide the information provided by appellee, their was a disincentive to provide consumers with such information.

Appellants challenged both ruling. On appeal, the court affirmed both rulings of the trial court and held that not only had appellants failed to exhaust administrative remedies prior to filing their vested rights action, no such action was supported prior to final map approval.

Appellant sought declaratory relief as to the parties' rights and duties and whether respondent violated his fiduciary duty to appellant.

The court reasoned that a contrary result could allow a person rejected as a limited partner to defeat the desires of the limited or substitute partners by becoming an assignee. The court held that the issue of the constitutionality of &sect; 15519 was not properly raised below because appellant did not raise the issue prior to the order of dismissal, and where appellant did not allege loss of property, there existed no unconstitutional taking, U.S. Const. amend XIV.</SPAN></P>

The people denied defendant discovery of citizen complaints against police officers because the police department had destroyed all complaints that were not sustained. The court held that the principal question was whether sanctions should have been imposed because of the destruction of the complaint files, and if so, whether the appropriate sanction should have been dismissal of the charges. The court concluded that sanctions were appropriate because destruction of the complaints deprived defendant of a fair trial. On remand defendant would be entitled to have the jury instructed that the officers used excessive or unnecessary force against citizens on whatever number of occasions was equal to the number of incidents for which complaint files were improperly destroyed. The court held that the destruction of the documents was not justified on the grounds that prior approval of the city council was obtained.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's trial was due to an inspection of his facility and its books by a health official. Appellant sought review, contending that the warrantless health department inspection of the business records of his nursing home was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment of conviction because the administrative search was reasonable within the meaning of the U.S. Const. IV. The court held that such inspections were crucial to the effective oversight of the physical well-being of patients, to ensure that they were not neglected or even abused.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with involuntary manslaughter. Defendant's relatives applied for permission to post an interest in real property in lieu of bail. A trial court denied the relatives' petition for writ of mandate directing a magistrate to permit the deposit of their real property interest. Defendant filed a petition for writ of mandate from the trial court's order. The court issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing the trial court to accept the relatives' posting of an instrument of security in real property to secure defendant's appearance and obtain his release. The court construed Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1298 as permitting the giving of security in the form of an interest in real property by others on behalf of defendant equally with the posting of the real property security by defendant personally. The court conceived of no rational basis which justified a distinction between pretrial release based upon defendant's posting an equity in his own real property, and the posting by others of their equity in the same form of property. Although protection of the licensed bail bond business protected a significant public interest, the classification involved was not a rational one.</SPAN></P>

There was no rational basis justifying a distinction between defendant's posting equity and the posting by others.</SPAN></P>

The court held that government action produced the school district lines which determined the racial imbalance, and if those lines created or maintained an imbalance which deprived minority groups of their right to equal educational opportunities, then there was an equal protection violation under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, regardless of whether state authorities intended the district lines to segregate, and petitioners should have been permitted to attempt to establish the feasibility of correcting the alleged interdistrict segregation.

Defendant was found to be a mentally disordered sex offender and was committed to a mental hospital pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.  &sect; 6316.1 for the maximum term of imprisonment which could have been imposed for the underlying offenses. Defendant argued the trial court erred in denying his motion to compel the prosecuting witnesses--two nine-year-old girls--to submit to psychiatric examinations. In affirming the convictions, the court held that where the trial court had an opportunity for full appraisement of the girls and where defendant conceded that what they testified to could have happened, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to deny the motion. The court also held that defendant waived any objection he had to evidence of prior offenses by him against the girls by cross-examining them and that the maximum term provision of &sect; 6316.1 met the strict scrutiny standard and was therefore not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court, in reversing the trial court on the issue of attorney fees, held that plaintiff was not entitled to an award of attorney fees. There was no statutory or contractual provision providing for the award of attorney fees. The common fund doctrine did not apply because no identifiable sum of money was created, preserved, or recovered. The substantial benefit rule, as a basis for awarding attorney fees, was not applicable because a substantial benefit was not conferred on an ascertainable class. Plaintiff's representation did not meet the tests of the private attorney general theory because the strength or societal importance vindicated by the decision was minor, and plaintiff's stake in the matter far exceeded that of other taxpayers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, city and county, appealed an order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiff importer after plaintiff filed a complaint for recovery of 1975 ad valorem property taxes paid under protest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff importer filed a complaint for recovery of ad valorem property taxes for 1975 which it paid under protest to defendants, city and county. The trial court granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and awarded the taxes paid plus interest. Defendants appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defendants' collection of the 1975 ad valorem taxes was in violation of Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 226, which clearly provided for prospective-only application of a 1976 U.S. Supreme Court decision overruling previous cases preventing states from imposing nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes on imported goods until the goods lost their character as imports and became incorporated into the mass property of the state. In so holding, the court noted that the issue of constitutionality of the statute had already been decided in a previous case. Because the taxes paid by plaintiff under protest and sought to be refunded were for 1975, a year that fell within the time period when such taxes were declared unconstitutional, plaintiff was entitled to a refund as a matter of law. Thus, the court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to plaintiff importer because defendants, city and county, had attempted to retroactively apply the holding of a U.S. Supreme Court decision regarding ad valorem property taxes even though the California legislature had, via statute, clearly declared that the case would be applied prospectively only.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Defendant argues that the identical reasoning applies here since the Legislature has defined and prescribed the punishment for a more specific offense, namely, Penal Code section 217 pertaining to assault with intent to commit murder.  Defendant's argument is consistent with the well known rule by which a specific legislative enactment controls a more general one.  We agree that here, Penal Code section 217 precluded his charge and conviction pursuant to the general attempt statute,&nbsp;Penal Code section 664.  The People, relying on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">People </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> Meriweather</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 263 Cal.App.2d 559, 563 [69 Cal.Rptr. 880], contend that defendant was properly charged pursuant to Penal Code section 664.  They concede that no other case has decided this question but rely on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Meriweather</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which held that the offense of assault with intent to commit murder defined and punished by Penal Code section 217 is distinct from attempted murder (Pen. Code, &sect;&sect; 187, 664).  We hold that defendant's basic sentence should have been&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  based on Penal Code section 217 rather than Penal Code sections 187 and 664; accordingly, the judgment is affirmed, except for the sentence; the trial court is directed to resentence defendant pursuant to Penal Code section 217.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of attempted murder, with firearm and great bodily harm by the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California). Defendant contended that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022.7 did not apply to attempts, that the state's closing argument was prejudicial, that the admission of his statements violated U.S. Const. amend. VI, and that he was punishable under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 217, not Cal. Penal Code &sect; 664.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of attempted murder, with the use of a firearm and great bodily injury. For purposes of sentencing, his prior conviction, assault with a deadly weapon coupled with use of a firearm capable of being concealed, was considered. The court affirmed defendant's conviction of attempted murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 664 and great bodily injury under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022.7 because attempted murder was a separate, distinct crime and not included in &sect; 12022.7. The court ruled that the state made fair comment on the defense evidence and that the jury was properly instructed on defendant's right not to testify. The court found that defendant was properly advised and voluntarily waived his Miranda rights and that he had no per se right to counsel in the pre-indictment setting. The court reversed and remanded because defendant's sentence was excessive and incorrectly based on Cal. Penal Code &sect; 664, the attempted murder statute. The court ruled that defendant was to be sentenced for assault with intent to commit murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 217, an offense which was statutorily distinct from attempted murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed and held that defendant's conviction of attempted murder was proper, that he was not denied his right to counsel during the pre-indictment process, and that the state made fair comment on the defense evidence. The court reversed and remanded for resentencing because defendant should have been sentenced under the assault with intent to commit murder statute, not the attempted murder statute.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was granted summary judgment because the tax rate for the short period was in fact the higher tax rate, and the increase in the tax rate was constitutional.

Penal Code &sect;&sect; 311.2 and 311.9, and six prior convictions of violating &sect; 311.2. He appealed based on his contention that &sect; 311.2 was unconstitutional under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, he was deprived of equal protection due to grand jury indictment instead of a preliminary hearing, and the prosecution failed to present expert evidence that the materials appealed to the prurient interest of a deviant sexual group. The court affirmed and held that the subject material fell into the general definition of obscene matter for which no expert testimony was required; in fact, no evidence beyond merely showing the materials was required. Moreover, defendant waived this argument by his opening statement that none was required. Since prior case law had squarely upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 311.2, the court summarily dismissed that contention. Finally, the court held defendant's contention he was deprived of equal protection by the grand jury indictment process was not available because his guilty plea predated the judicial decision in support of his argument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence on seven counts of possessing obscene matter with intent to distribute it to others because there was no reversible error in the absence of expert testimony establishing deviant group prurient interest, defendant was not deprived of equal protection by the grand jury indictment, and the consecutive sentences did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 288a(e) did not violate a fundamental right, as defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of sexual privacy in jail. The court ruled that defendant was not denied equal protection of the law because punishing prisoners for consensual oral copulation while permitting adults outside the jail to engage in it, did not discriminate on the basis of a suspect classification. The court held that &sect; 288a(e) was rationally related to the governmental purpose of maintaining prison discipline and order as homosexual contacts in jail could lead to violent altercations. Finally, the court held that &sect; 288a(e) did not impose cruel and unusual punishment because oral copulation was not a status offense for which criminal punishment was prohibited and the punishment was not shockingly disproportionate to the crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for participating in an act of oral copulation while in jail. The court held that defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy as to sexual behavior in jail, that he was not denied equal protection of the law because the law was rationally related to the purpose of maintaining prison discipline and order, and that the punishment was not cruel and unusual.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant municipality enacted an on-premises sign ordinance that included subsequent amendments, which imposed various requirements on signs in the commercial and industrial zones within the city, required the payment of a sign inventory license fee by on-premises sign owners in those zones, and required the abatement of non-conforming signs throughout those zones within seven years. Plaintiff sign owner was one of those billed for the sign inventory fee under the original ordinance. Plaintiffs then filed a complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief. After the ordinance was amended by defendant, plaintiffs amended their complaint and contended that the sign inventory license fees imposed by the amended ordinance was an impermissible exercise of the defendant's police power used to impose a tax to generate revenue that was not authorized by defendant's charter. The trial court held the ordinance and amendments constitutional. The court affirmed and held that the defendant's amended ordinance, which included the imposition of reasonable sign inventory fees, was a valid exercise of defendant's police power as a charter city under Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed and held that the defendant city's ordinance was a valid exercise of defendant's police power. The court held that the sign inventory fee was a regulatory license fee that did not violate the constitutional right of freedom of speech, nor denied equal protection of the laws to owners or users, and afforded substantive due process to those persons affected, and that the amortization scheme for nonconforming signs was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

However, the trial court refused to grant the request of defendant for an additional 32 days credit for good time served at the jail, to which he claimed he was entitled pursuant to Cal.

The court agreed with the defendant, finding that defendants ultimately convicted of felonies were entitled to good time for the time spent in the county jail prior to their felony convictions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent inheritor inherited the corpora of two revocable trusts which consisted of shares of stock, government bonds and notes, and a bank account, that the decedent, a resident of Mexico and citizen of the United States, held in California. Because Mexico did not impose inheritance tax on the property, an inheritance tax referee determined that tax was due on the intangible personal property pursuant to Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. &sect; 13851. Respondent objected and the probate court ruled that no tax was due because the statute was unconstitutional. The court reversed and held that the statute did not deny respondent equal protection of the law because the statute had a reasonable objective of taxation by at least one jurisdiction but avoiding double taxation, and treated members of the same class in the same way. The court held that the statute was valid because the legislature could make any conditions it chose on exemptions because the right to make a testamentary disposition of property was not an inherent right or a right of citizenship. The court, however, held that the bank account was exempt from tax pursuant to Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. &sect; 13303.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's decision and held that the statute which governed inheritance tax exemptions for nonresidents of the United States and residents living outside of California did not violate equal protection laws. The court, however, held that the inheritance of a bank account was exempt from tax by statute. The court remanded the case with directions to calculate the inheritance tax in accordance to its ruling.</SPAN></P>

The court held that petitioner's &sect; 995 motion was not time-barred because it was brought within the no opportunity exception provided in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1510, but the evidence received by the magistrate showed reasonable cause for the allegations of special circumstances and a rational ground for the assumption that a rape was committed and petitioner was guilty of it. The court held petitioner was not entitled to relief from the orders denying his &sect; 995 motions.

The trial court entered a judgment in condemnation for plaintiff and denied defendants' postjudgment motions for a new trial, for costs and disbursements, for litigation costs, and for expenses. At trial, appraisers for both parties testified to differing valuations. On appeal, the court found that there was nothing in the record to show that plaintiff's appraiser's testimony was not credible. The court also found that that the lower court properly took judicial notice of the appraisal as a genuine document. The court held that nothing about the appraisal entitled defendants to a new trial and that the appraisal properly took into account project enhancement. Because there was no evidence of physical invasion or direct legal restraint of defendants' property, the court found there was no de facto taking. The court found that delay damages were not proper because the property was held for investment only.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant surface owners were allowed to make a preemptive bid with respect to a geothermal lease under Cal.

The lower court ruled in favor of defendants and upheld the statute's constitutionality. Plaintiff appealed. Plaintiff contended that the preference extended to defendants under Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect; 6922 violated the gift prohibition contained in Cal. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 6, and that it violated plaintiff's equal protection rights. The court affirmed the ruling of the lower court upholding the constitutionality of Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect; 6922, and held that the right of first refusal of a geothermal lease was not a gift in the constitutional sense, as it served a legitimate public purpose by likely promoting economic growth. The court also held that Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect; 6922 did not violate plaintiff's equal protection rights, as there was an important state interest in giving preference to defendants, and that the classification under Cal. Pub. Res.

The charge of plagiarism was found true at a university hearing and the president of the university approved the recommendation of permanent expulsion.

The lower court denied plaintiff's writ because the statute of limitations had run pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 338. Plaintiff contended that a separate cause of action accrued on the refusal to reinstate that was made several years after plaintiff's expulsion. The court found that the refusal to reinstate did not give rise to a separate cause of action because no intervening act gave plaintiff a right that he did not have previously and the statute of limitations could not be extended by plaintiff postponing his demand for re-entry. The court also found that plaintiff had no right to higher education where he had abused it and that Rule 11 of the Student Disciplinary Procedures did not limit the period of plaintiff's suspension.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed an order of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which granted defendant husband's motion for summary judgment in an action for damages for personal injuries she sustained in a car accident. The trial court found no triable issue of fact and held that plaintiff was precluded, as a matter of law, from the recovery of personal injury damages from defendant when the charge was simple negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife brought an action for damages for personal injuries she sustained in a car accident against her defendant husband. Plaintiff was a passenger, riding in a car that was driven by defendant, the husband and the co-owner of the car, when it collided with another car. She charged defendant with negligently causing her injuries. The lower court granted an order of summary judgment in favor of defendant. Plaintiff appealed. The court found that the section of the state code that prevented plaintiff from filing suit against defendant violated state and federal equal protection standards. The provision at issue was enacted to treat owner-passengers as guests under the guest statute. However, because car passengers were no longer denied recovery for injuries suffered because of a negligent driver, the classification defeated the purpose of according owner-passengers the same protections as guests because it singled out owner-passengers for differential treatment from all other car accident victims. It was permissible for a spouse to sue a spouse for an intentional or negligent personal tort. The decision of the lower court was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant. The state statute in question violated state and federal equal protection standards by singling out injured passengers who happened to own the car in which they were injured. Further, the marital state of the parties formed no rational basis for denial of equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

Rev. &amp; Tax Code &sect; 19254, requesting production of certain bank records. Respondent tax board was joined as a real party in interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An investigator for respondent tax board issued two administrative subpoenas duces tecum to respondent banks pursuant to Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 19254, for the financial records of appellant, general partner and others, so as to determine whether the partnerships had complied with the Personal Income Tax Law. Appellants request for a permanent injunction was denied. On appeal, the court reversed and directed the trial court to dismiss the action as moot. Although the act appellants sought to enjoin had been completed, the court adjudicated the issues involved as being in the public interest and to prevent future litigation of the same questions. The court found that a 1974 amendment to Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, extended the right of privacy to a person's confidential financial affairs. The court held that when fundamental liberties were at stake, the challenged law must be shown to be necessary, and not merely rationally related to, the accomplishment of a permissible state policy. In applying strict scrutiny, the court found Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 7474 overbroad and therefore, an unconstitutional invasion of a citizen's right to privacy in violation of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect;1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order denying the permanent injunction requested by appellants, general partner and others, with directions to the trial court to dismiss the action for being moot prior to its final determination on appeal. In adjudicating the issues as being in the public interest, the court found the statute authorizing issuance of subpoenas duces tecum was overbroad and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's decisions and held that the nonsuit was proper because the city's property was not defective and could not be considered dangerous except for its proximity to the railroad tracks. Further, the court held that &sect; 1714.7 was constitutional because it was not a special statute and did not violate the equal protection or privileges and immunities clauses.

Furthermore, the court found that neither U.S. Const. amend. I or Cal. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">City and County of San Francisco, Cal. Prop. K required petitioner taxi permit holders to obtain new permits that would no longer be transferable as they had been under prior ordinances. Petitioners sought a preliminary injunction to prevent enforcement of Prop. K, claiming that the proposition was not properly submitted to the electorate and that the proposition was unconstitutional. The court discharged the writs of mandate and denied the claims. The court held that pursuant to City of San Francisco, Cal. Charter &sect; 9.08, a proposition could be placed before the voters in a general election on a submission by one-third of the municipal supervisors. Prop. K, submitted by one-third of the supervisors, was on the ballot during a direct primary. The court held that a direct primary was a regular election under Cal. Elec. Code &sect; 26 and that a regular election fell within the requirements of &sect; 9.08. The court further held that petitioners had no vested property rights in the taxi permits. The permits were a privilege that could be regulated under local police powers. Without a vested property right, there was no constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alternative writs of mandate were discharged and the petitions were denied. The proposition was properly submitted to the voters and enacted by their vote. The proposition was not unconstitutional because taxicab use of the streets was a privilege and granting a permit did not create a constitutionally vested property right that the proposition interfered with.</SPAN></P>

Gov't Code &sect; 81000 et seq. (Act), disclosing nonmonetary contribution for campaign work of an employee of the State of California. In anticipation of the suit, respondents filed an action against appellant. The court reversed the ruling for respondents, holding that the term &quot;person&quot; under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 82047 included public entities because general case law held that public entities were included among &quot;persons&quot; in statutory language where inclusion would not infringe upon sovereign governmental powers. Inclusion would not infringe upon governmental powers because the legislature only needed to exercise due care in separating campaigning and legislative activities, and the activities for the campaign, soliciting contributions, planning strategy, coordinating volunteer work, and preparing the budget, were unambiguously political. The legislature intended all contributions to be disclosed because the Act's purpose was to inhibit improper practices.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile sought review of a decision by the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which denied his application for rehearing from a decision by a juvenile court referee, who found that appellant violated Cal. Penal Code &sect; 236, false imprisonment. Appellant argued that he was denied due process, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Cal. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 7a, 15.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a juvenile court referee made a finding that appellant juvenile came within Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 602 by violating Cal. Penal Code &sect; 236, appellant juvenile requested a rehearing, which was denied by a juvenile court judge. Appellant sought review, contending that he was denied due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 7a, 15 by being placed in jeopardy before a referee who could lawfully decide against him, but not in his favor, Cal. Const. art. VI, &sect; 22. Appellant argued that a juvenile court could not hold a jurisdictional hearing under California's statutory procedure, absent a stipulation between the parties. Agreeing with appellant's contentions, the court reversed the lower court's order and remanded. The court found that a referee's acquittal could not be reheard because to do so would constitute double jeopardy. The court reasoned that the referee's findings would, therefore, be a final determination, which was constitutionally proscribed. Therefore, appellant was subject to a procedure where the trier of fact could only find against him, a violation of constitutional standards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order declaring appellant juvenile a ward of the court and committing him to the California Youth Authority, and remanded to juvenile court for further proceedings. The court found that appellant was denied constitutional due process by being placed in jeopardy before a referee who could lawfully decide against him, but not in his favor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent landowner constructed a dam across a river on his property, creating a reservoir and limiting the amount of water continuing on to down water property owners. Appellant State of California sought to enjoin respondent's use of the reservoir because respondent did not obtain a permit to build the dam and collect the water. The injunction was denied. The court affirmed the lower court's order. The court held that the permit requirements in the 1913 Water Commission Act, Cal. Water Code &sect; 1200 et seq., applied only to waters taken by appropriation. Respondent took water based on prescription. The court found that respondent had perfected his title to the reservoir because he had used the reservoir continuously for more than five years, and the diversion of the water to the reservoir was open, notorious, under a claim of right, and hostile to downstream owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying injunctive relief was affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the director of the California state department of health, appealed from a judgment rendered in Superior Court of Alameda County (California) in an action for declaratory relief, where the court allowed plaintiff physician the difference between his full fee and the lesser amount paid under the California medical assistance program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff physician initiated an action for declaratory relief against defendant trustee and defendant, the director of the California state department of health (DOH), because defendant trustee refused to pay plaintiff the difference between the amount plaintiff received for medical care rendered under the California medical assistance program (Medi-Cal) and the amount he would have received for medical care administered to a private patient, on advice from Medi-Cal's fiscal intermediary. The court held that defendant DOH's interest was not injuriously affected by the judgment, he was not a &quot;party aggrieved&quot; according to Cal. Civ. Proc.  &sect; 902, and thus had no legal right to pursue an appeal. Furthermore, defendant DOH was not a proper party to the declaratory relief action, as there was no justiciable controversy between defendant DOH and plaintiff. Without a controversy, the court would be required to render an advisory opinion, which was explicitly forbidden by law in an action brought for declaratory relief. The court remanded the matter to the trial court with directions to dismiss the action as to the defendant DOH.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was neither a proper party to the declaratory relief action, as no controversy existed between defendant and plaintiff physician, nor did he have a legal right to pursue an appeal, because he was not injuriously affected by the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant purchaser sought review of the order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which granted summary judgment in favor of respondent defaulting property owners, quieting title and declaring parts of the Improvement Act of 1911, Cal. Sts. &amp; High. Code &sect; 6400 et seq., unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city foreclosed on and sold real estate, owned by respondent defaulting property owners, to appellant purchaser, because respondents failed to pay their assessed share of an improvement bond relating to street improvements. In an action to quiet title to the real estate in question, the trial court granted summary judgment to respondents, declaring parts of the Improvement Act of 1911 (act), Cal. Sts. &amp; High. Code &sect; 6400 et seq., unconstitutional, because it failed to give adequate notice to landowners of the risk of foreclosure. Appellant challenged the trial court's order. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in favor of respondents, finding the provisions of the act, as it was at the time of the order, were not reasonably calculated to inform the property owner of the sale proceedings and of his right of redemption, which deprived him of his constitutional right to due process. However, the court did not hold that all the provisions of the act were unconstitutional, as the key notification provisions had been amended, since the judgment was originally rendered, to give adequate notification to property owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, quieting title in favor of respondent defaulting property owners over appellant purchaser, holding that sections of the Improvement Act of 1911 were insufficient to give fair notice, as required by constitutional due process. However, the court declined to hold all the applicable provisions the act unconstitutional, because later amendments provided property owners the requisite due process.</SPAN></P>
