The court affirmed defendants' convictions, holding that the jury verdicts were supported by strong evidence of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, their arrests were based on probable cause, and their consents to the seizure of their clothes was completely voluntary. The court found no prejudicial error from the State's actions and concluded that the trial court's jury instruction was in the exact language of the applicable instructions and closely paralleled the statute. The court reduced the sentences imposed for the attempted rape offenses and ordered that they would run concurrently with the murder sentences, instead of consecutively pursuant to Ill. Rev.

Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1402 (1971), applied to the heroin convictions, and that his sentences should be modified under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 615 so that he could be admitted to probation. The state conceded that the convictions for marijuana possession were unconstitutional. The court reversed the unconstitutional marijuana convictions, modified the sentences imposed on the heroin convictions to conform to the Controlled Substances Act, and affirmed those sentences as modified. Where the Controlled Substances Act had been amended and the application of the amended provisions to defendant's circumstances would violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws, the court sentenced defendant under the original act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Environmental Protection Agency filed a complaint against the corporation, which operated a public water supply facility. The complaint was filed against the corporation and against the present and former stockholders, and it charged that the corporation failed to maintain a safe and adequate water supply in violation of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 1018. At a hearing before the board, it was established that the former stockholder was notified that the corporation was in violation of the Act and was directed to make corrections. The board dismissed the complaint against the original stockholders and imposed a fine on the former stockholder. A cease and desist order was issued against the present stockholder and the corporation. On appeal, the court noted that the board found the corporation, the former, and present stockholders guilty of violating the Act, but that it only assessed a fine against the former stockholder. Because there was nothing in the parties' conduct that warranted different treatment for one of them, the court held that the fine assessed against the former stockholder was arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>

The judgment awarded $ 750,000 in attorneys' fees to the attorneys who represented plaintiff taxpayers in their successful prosecution of a class action lawsuit against the objectors. The lawsuit challenged the objectors' distribution of tax collection commissions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers prevailed in their class action lawsuit against the objectors. As a result of the litigation, a fund was created from collected tax monies and held by a trustee bank. Objectors argued on appeal that because the fund was composed entirely of collected tax monies, and because the fund was not to be distributed to the class but rather to a taxing body, then no attorneys' fees could be paid from the fund. They alternatively argued that even if an award of attorneys' fees was proper, the amount set by the trial judge was excessive. The award of attorneys' fees was affirmed. The court held that an order awarding attorneys' fees from the fund brought into the trial court by the taxpayers was proper. The court noted that the order creating the fund and its ultimate disposition was affirmed in objectors' second appeal of the case to the Illinois Supreme Court. The court also held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in setting the amount of the award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner sought a variance in order to build a garage on her property. Although there was no record of the precise action taken on the application by the zoning board of appeals, the property owner claimed that the board approved the variance. The village board of trustees then met and overruled or refused to accept the board's recommendation for the variance. The property owner filed a complaint for a writ of mandamus to compel appellees to grant the variance. Appellees filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which the trial court granted. The property owner sought review and the court affirmed. The court found that the village's zoning ordinance specifically restricted the board's power with respect to variances to the role of making recommendations to the village board. The court stated that the zoning board was not vested with the power to make final administrative decisions as to such matters. Therefore, the court found that the zoning board's approval of the property owner's application was nothing more than a recommendation to the village board. Thus, there was no final administrative action by the zoning board and the mandamus action was improper.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court's ruling was delayed until the evidence was to be introduced, at which point the circuit court overruled defendant's objection. It never specifically ruled on the motion to suppress. On appeal, the court held that although the better procedure would have been to rule on the motion to suppress, there was no reversible error because the identification of defendant was clearly had an independent origin arising from the uninfluenced observation of defendant. The attack took place in a well-lighted laundromat. The woman had sufficient time to observe defendant at close range. The court also rejected defendant's claim that Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother was found guilty of child neglect based in part on evidence that she permitted two daughters to smoke marijuana that her live-in boyfriend had brought into the home and that the boyfriend had asked one of the daughters to have his child. Three of her five children were removed. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the statute was not unconstitutional. The statute did not deprive the mother of due process of law. It was not so vague and overly broad as to lack adequate notice of what parental acts it proscribed, and it did not include within its coverage parental acts which were constitutionally protected. Although the language of the statute was general, due process did not require standards more specific than could reasonably be applied. The State had a compelling interest to protect children from abuse and neglect, and a narrower statute would have diminished the rights of children who had no other means of protecting themselves.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction for violation of his bail bond. The court held that violation of bail bond was an offense separate and distinct from that of possession and sale of marijuana. The court noted, however, that under the Unified Code of Corrections, Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the Department filed an petition to condemn the land and moved for immediate vesting of title under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 47, para. 2.1-2.10 (1967), the owners stipulated as to a preliminary finding concerning just compensation for the property. After a quick-take order was entered, the land was deeded to the Commission. The owners' petition and traverse under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 72 (1971) alleged that when the Department filed the condemnation petition, it knew that the Commission planned to grant an easement along the border of the site for a highway and that the Department fraudulently concealed that information from the owners. In affirming the denial of the owners' petition and traverse, the court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 72 (1971) applied. The owners failed to prove that the Department made any deliberate attempt to conceal any information about the highway. Under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 127, para. 47.21 (1967), the necessity for taking by eminent domain for the accelerator laboratory was a legislative question within the discretion of the Department, whose decision was conclusive in the absence of a clear abuse of the power granted.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of burglary. He appealed his sentence and the denial of his post-conviction relief petition. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The indictment against defendant was sufficient even though the burglary count did not allege ownership. The admission of evidence from a possibly tainted search and seizure was harmless error because there was testimony from four witnesses that defendant had participated in the crime and two other witnesses corroborated their testimony. The witnesses were located through a lawful police investigation so they properly testified at trial. The court did find that defendant's sentence was not within the sentencing range for his crime.

The gun was not introduced in evidence, although at trial one of the officers said it was a .25 caliber pistol. The court held that the variance in descriptions of the gun and the failure to introduce it at trial did not affect the credibility of the officer's testimony.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a bench trial, defendant was convicted of raping his victim in an alley and was sentenced to 5-10 years' imprisonment. Defendant sought review of his conviction, and the court held that &sect; 11, which required a consideration of rehabilitation in all sentencing proceedings, did not deprive the legislature of its power to fix minimum penalties for crimes. The court reasoned that &sect; 11 was a statement of public policy aimed at the legislature as well as the courts, and that the legislature had considered both the seriousness of the crime of rape as well as rehabilitation in determining that the interest of the public required a minimum sentence of four years. The court then held that defendant's sentence was not disproportionate to the crime of rape, although it exceeded the statutory minimum, because defendant's sentencing hearing revealed a pattern of anti-social conduct and various misdemeanor and other offenses.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After minority organizations and associated individuals (organizations) engaged in demonstrations, which sometimes involved criminal acts, regarding the need for more minority workers on the company's work crews, the company filed an action seeking a restraining order and a permanent injunction. After a remand based on the circuit court's use of an improper ground for denying the restraining order and injunction, the circuit court granted the injunction. The court affirmed the grant of the injunction after modifying its wording, holding that the demonstrations were not peaceful and, thus, they could be enjoined without violating the organizations' rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The court also held that under the circumstances, an action against a class was justified, and the acts enjoined had been pleaded and proven. The court further held that there was sufficient grounds to make one of the organizations a party defendant. The court held that the &quot;unclean hands&quot; doctrine was inapplicable because there was no evidence that the company engaged in any inequitable conduct that would have caused the defendants to engage in unlawful and violent conduct.</SPAN></P>

The owners requested that the trial court recall and rescind the sale of their property, stating that the property was sold to the purchaser in error and while their objection was pending and that they had received no notice of the sale. The trial court initially entered the order recalling and rescinding the sale, but later vacated the order. The order was appealed by the owners. The court affirmed the trial court's order vacating the recall and rescission of the tax sale and denying reconsideration of the matter because the order was not appealable as a final judgment, nor was it the type of order from which an interlocutory appeal may be taken. The trial court denied reconsideration without prejudice, and in the action for the tax deed, the owners would be permitted to raise their arguments regarding the impropriety of the tax sale as defenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Will County (Illinois), which entered a judgment of conviction after a bench trial for the crimes of taking indecent liberties with a four year old child and aggravated battery. Defendant was sentenced to a term of four to six years on the indecent liberties charge and to a term of three to six years on the aggravated battery count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant stated that she hit the child across the face, scratched him, bit his penis, and then put a toilet brush up the child's rectum. Defendant contended that &sect; 12-4 of the Criminal Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, &sect; 12-4, was unconstitutional because it created an unreasonable classification in violation of the equal protection clause. The court found no equal protection violation because the State's Attorney had the responsibility of evaluating the evidence and other pertinent factors to determine the proper charge. Further, there was no constitutional requirement that two persons convicted of the same offense receive the same punishment. Intent for the crime of indecent liberties, under &sect; 11-4(a)(2) of the Criminal Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, &sect; 11-4(a)(2), could be inferred from the act itself and the surrounding circumstances. Additionally, defendant waived the defense of intoxication where she offered no proof at trial. Defendant was not wrongfully convicted and sentenced for multiple offenses arising out of the same event. The conduct was distinct and separate acts, which constituted two separate and distinct crimes, with each crime requiring different elements of proof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the sentence for aggravated battery to a minimum of one and two-thirds years and a maximum of five years. The court then affirmed the judgments as modified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted him of the offense of jumping bail in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, par. 38--10 (1963). After a hearing in aggravation and mitigation the trial court sentenced defendant to serve two to five years in the penitentiary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the bail jumping statute was unconstitutional on its face or as applied to him because it did not require any criminal mental state at the time bond forfeiture was incurred, he was not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, he was denied due process when the trial court charged the jury on a crime not charged in the indictment, and the sentence was excessive. The court affirmed the conviction but remanded for sentencing. The statute did not make punishable an innocent failure to surrender oneself within 30 days after incurring bond forfeiture. In any case, the confusion in the setting of the case did not support a finding of innocent bail jumping because defendant stayed away for more than two years, willfully intending to avoid prosecution. The jury charge was proper; it merely informed the jury of a law requiring reporting of an address change. Defendant was entitled to a sentence reduction in accordance with Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, par. 1008--2-- 4 (Supp. 1972) because the maximum sentence for bail jumping under a new sentencing standard, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, par. 32-10 (Supp1972), went into effect before defendant's case was finally adjudicated.</SPAN></P>

Also, defendant denied owning a gun and shooting his wife; thus, the sole issue before the jury was whether defendant committed the murder as charged in the indictment. Further, Ill. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 1012(a) banned the discharge of contaminants so as to cause water pollution. The corporation argued that the Board was improperly exercising judicial authority, that Ill. Sanitary Water Board Rules and Regulations SWB-5, art I, R. 1.01, which governed the storage of cyanides, was unconstitutional, that Ill. Sanitary Water Board Rules and Regulations SWB-5, art I, R. 1.02, governing the issuance of permits for disposal was unlawful, and that requiring the corporation to deal with both city and state environmental agencies was arbitrary. The court reversed the penalty and otherwise affirmed. The imposition of a discretionary penalty by an administrative agency was an exercise of judicial authority and violative of the separation of powers doctrine of Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 1. Nevertheless, the challenged regulations did not violate the Environmental Protection Act. To require disposers of cyanide to work in close cooperation with cities, the owners of sewage treatment plants, was a reasonable condition necessary to maintain the purity of water.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The candidate and the alderman were the only candidates whose names appeared on the paper ballots used in that election. The candidate alleged that a true count would establish that he, not the alderman received a majority of the votes, and that the election judges miscounted the votes. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the complaint was insufficient in law within the meaning of the election contest statute under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, paras. 21-27 (1969). Because the candidate chose to guess at or estimate discrepancies between the official and actual election results, he failed to satisfactorily allege that the irregularities would have affected the outcome of the election, as required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, paras. 21-27 (1969). The candidate's general allegations in the complaint that a true court would establish that he, not the alderman, received a majority of the votes were insufficient.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff losing candidate filed an action against defendants, the winning candidate and members of the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners (Illinois), contesting the election of the winning candidate as alderman of the twenty-first ward in the City of Chicago. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) dismissed the complaint on the basis that it was insufficient in law. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sole issue presented for review was whether the complaint was sufficient in law within the meaning of the election contest statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, &sect; 21-27 (1969). The court found that the complaint fell far short of affording a basis for the contest sought. Plaintiff's general allegation that a true count would establish that plaintiff, not the winning candidate, received a majority of the votes was insufficient to meet the statutory requirement. The court held that since plaintiff chose to guess at or estimate discrepancies between the official and actual election results, he failed to satisfactorily allege that the irregularities would have affected the outcome of the election. Plaintiff contended that the decision of the trial court violated his federal and state constitutional rights. The court found that the election judges entered the tallies, certified the canvass sheets that the results were correct, and returned the canvass sheets to the Board of Election Commissioners. Plaintiff would not be permitted to overcome the sworn-to findings of these officers by merely estimating voting irregularities or by other general allegations of voting irregularities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which found him guilty of rape after a bench trial. He contended that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt he was the offender, that the uncorroborated testimony of the complaining witness did not support his conviction, that Illinois' rape statute was unconstitutional, and that he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to a trial by jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested two months after the alleged rape after the victim pointed him out to a policeman she was talking to. She testified at trial that she could see her assailant's face from the time he opened the interior door of the vestibule until he walked past her in the hall of her apartment building. He turned and grabbed and raped her. The trial court, in a bench trial, convicted defendant and he appealed. The court reversed the judgment of conviction because it concluded that the victim's uncorroborated testimony lacked the attributes of being clear and convincing. She had limited time, a few seconds, to view the face of her assailant, under poor lighting conditions. She did not identify him for more than two months when she saw him for only &quot;a split second&quot; when he was wearing different clothing. She gave a description to the police that did not match defendant's physical description. The evidence indicated a lack of an adequate opportunity for a positive identification of the defendant as her assailant. Defendant was discharged because the State was not allowed a second chance to meet its burden of proof in a trial in which it failed to adduce sufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of conviction and ordered that defendant not be retried.</SPAN></P>

When the plant had operated for some period of time and in said operation its pollution control equipment was proven clearly capable of controlling pollution under the Pollution Control Board's own standards and the operation was conducted with the knowledge of, and without objection by, the agency, that constituted, in effect, an acquiescence in said operation without an installation permit.

Defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief arguing that because the drug convictions had been rendered void by a court decision, the conviction for bail jumping should be found void also. The trial court voided the convictions for the sale and possession of marijuana, but dismissed that portion of the petition concerning the bail jumping conviction. Defendant sought review. On appeal, the court determined that the fact that the underlying conviction was void did not render the bail jumping conviction void, and the voiding of the underlying convictions was not a sufficient basis for modifying the sentence imposed for the bail jumping conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In one case, the hearing board denied the corporation's application for a nursing home license because the corporation failed to comply with certain board of health rules and regulations.

In the second case, the trial court found &sect; 136-15 was invalid because it failed to comply with the conditions set forth in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 35.19 (1969). Defendants appealed, asserting that the trial court erred in finding the ordinance invalid. The court affirmed the judgments and held that the trial court did not err in finding the ordinance was an improper delegation of legislative authority because no standards were provided by the ordinance to govern the exercise of any delegated authority to an administrative body. The court concluded that the trial court correctly held that Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code &sect; 136-15 contravened Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 35.19 and was invalid.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the enhanced sentencing provision did not deny defendant equal protection of the laws because different sentences could properly be imposed for the same offense depending on a defendant's criminal record and rehabilitation potential. The court also ruled that defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained incident to his arrest was properly denied, noting that police had probable cause to arrest him without a warrant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The union argued that the temporary injunction was granted without adequate notice given to the union members and counsel and the court abused its discretion in holding the hearing without counsel present to represent the union and its members. The court found that the notice was adequate, especially in view of the immediate harm to the employer. The union also argued that the temporary injunction was contrary to law in that the enjoining of the picketing constituted an unconstitutional restriction on free speech and was a violation of the Illinois Anti-Injunction Act. Before the appeal was heard, the parties entered a collective bargaining agreement. The employer argued that the issue between the parties was moot because the issues between the parties had been resolved. The court, finding that the issue could not be considered as a public interest exception to the rule of mootness, not because of the issues raised, but because of the sketchy and ambivalent character of the evidence arising in large part from the procedure in the lower court. Thus, the claim was remanded to the trial court for the injunction to be vacated and the petition to be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the injunction and the judgment of the trial court was remanded with directions to vacate the temporary injunction and dismiss the petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Conditions in the lessees' apartment violated various sections of a housing code.

The lessees also brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief regarding repairs needed on the leased premises. Meanwhile, the lessor began a proceeding for forcible entry and detainer under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 80, para. 6. The court affirmed the order entered by the circuit court in the forcible entry and detainer action. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 100, para. 48(c) could not be used to consolidate the two lawsuits because there was no identity of parties or causes of action between the two cases. The housing code did provide protection to lessees from retaliatory actions where lessees availed themselves of the housing code's protection. But the lessees failed to establish that the lessor was aware of the lessees' actions under the housing code prior to commencing his lawsuit. Thus, there could be no retaliation, and no material fact question was created that precluded summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

The elector's suit was an attack on the constitutionality of &sect; 77 of the Township Organization Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 139, para. 77 (1969)) relating to voting viva voce or by standing to be counted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Upon realizing that no funds were available to pay their salaries, defendants called a special town meeting to re-examine the budget, appropriations, and levies for the funds that had been voted down at a prior meeting. The special meeting resulted in passage of the budgets, appropriations, and levies for the funds that had previously been disapproved. On appeal, the elector argued that the town meetings were unconstitutional because they were no longer a practical means of governing densely populated townships. The court affirmed the dismissal, holding that the statute regarding township government was not unconstitutional and did not dilute the vote of any bona fide elector who wished to exercise his franchise. The court refused to extend the &quot;one-man-one-vote&quot; rule in the action. The court noted that there were no bona fide electors who were excluded from the meeting hall or specifically prevented from voting. The elector merely disagreed with the result and conduct of the meeting. Furthermore, statutory revisions vested the subject matter of the instant special meeting in the board of town auditors rather than the town electors, which rendered the whole matter somewhat moot.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the fact that the legislature did not provide for all men engaged in occupations which involved some degree of danger did not render the act invalid, and the decedent was entitled to the protection of the act at the time of the accident. The court also held there was no merit in the contention that the trial court should have directed a verdict for the landowner, and there was ample evidence in the record to support the jury's finding that the landowner was in charge at the time of the occurrence. Finally, the court held the evidence was sufficient for the jury to have assessed the stated damages, and the court could not say as a matter of law that the jury's figure was the result of passion or prejudice.

Rev. Stat. ch. 43, paras. 166-182 (1969), wherein voters in their respective precincts voted to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages at retail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs contended that the local option provisions of the act were unconstitutional as an unlawful delegation of legislative authority. They argued that a precinct was merely a geographical unit for voting purposes, that it was not a unit of local government, and that the use of this geographical unit to facilitate community interests was arbitrary and unreasonable. They claimed that the local option provisions disrupted the orderly city planning by the elimination of a use which was originally contemplated and permitted under the zoning ordinance. Finally, plaintiffs argued that the license to sell alcoholic beverages at retail was a vested right and that it could not be taken for public use without the payment of just compensation. The court concluded that the use of a precinct as the geographical area for the determination of the issue was reasonably appropriate and constitutional; no disruption in the orderly planning of any municipality occurred when one of the several uses permitted by the ordinance was not put into effect; and a license to sell alcoholic beverages at retail was not a right but a privilege, and as such it was not subject to the protection of due process.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that although the recounts in question had already taken place, the appeal of the denial of the temporary injunction would not be dismissed as moot because this was an issue of substantial public importance. As a result, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court denying the temporary injunction, in part, because the technical defects alleged on appeal were not jurisdictional, the senator did not state in what manner he would have been irreparably harmed if a temporary injunction was not granted, and a temporary injunction would not be granted where it had the effect of giving the senator all the relief which could be obtained by a final decree.

The court determined that the minimal discrepancy regarding the license number missing one digit balanced against the correct make, color, and year of the car established sufficient ownership. The court also found that the trial jury correctly decided there was sufficient evidence to prove an entry into the vehicle. The court stated that the record showed that the officer saw defendants leave the vehicle after they pulled over to a curb and that defendants never left his sight between the time he followed them and apprehended them.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The pedestrian fell on a cross-walk owned by the city on January 9, 1962. Plaintiffs filed an action on November 19, 1966, to recover damages for injuries sustained by the pedestrian and for the husband's loss of consortium. The city filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that plaintiffs failed to give notice of injury within six months as required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, paras. 1-4-2, 1-4-3 (1961) and also failed to file the action within the two-year limitations period. On appeal of the trial court's order granting the motion and dismissing the action, the court affirmed. The court rejected the pedestrian's claim that the notice requirement tolled the statute of limitations until the notice requirement was held invalid by the Illinois Supreme Court two months before plaintiffs' filed their action and ruled that the pedestrian could not rely on her own lack of diligence in failing to file the notice to toll the two-year limitations period. The court also ruled that the husband's loss of consortium claim was governed by the two-year limitations period for personal injury, not the five-year period for damage to property under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 83, para. 16 (1961).</SPAN></P>

The Board's actions affirmed an identical decision by the city zoning administrator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Fifteen years prior to the lessee's occupation of the owner's building, a sign, which projected some 15 feet over a public sidewalk, was erected with the authority of a city council. Several changes in the message of the sign were later approved. After the lessee began occupying the space, it sought permission to change the lettering on the sign to reflect the name of its business. The administrator denied the permit, ruling that Chicago, Ill., Zoning Ordinance art. 8, &sect; 8.9 -- 6(2)(a) (1963) prohibited any change to existing signs that did not conform to zoning laws. In reversing the circuit court's ruling that had reversed the board's prohibition of the sign, the court ruled that the ordinance expressed an intent to eliminate nonconforming uses. Such provisions were constitutional where they were related to the public interest. The court ruled that it was hazardous to the public welfare to require pedestrians to walk below a sign suspended above a sidewalk. As such, the city was totally within its authority to eliminate the hazard. The lessee was not deprived of a sign since it could place one against the building.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment in favor of the executor and defendants appealed.

The imposition of a discretionary fine was a distinctly judicial act and could not have been exercised by an administrative body.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, who were convicted of crimes while already confined to the penitentiary, appealed the imposition by the Circuit Court of Randolph County (Illinois), pursuant to the Penitentiaries Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108, &sect; 118, of sentences to run consecutively to the sentences that they were already serving. Defendants argued that the imposition of consecutive sentences had been rendered unconstitutional by Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; II (1970).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Each defendant was sentenced to one to two years, to commence at the expiration of the sentence he was now serving. The statute in force at the time of sentencing was superceded by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-4(f) and (g), which also provided that sentences for crimes committed while confined and for escape or attempted escape should not commence until the expiration of the term under the which offender was held. Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; II (1970) provided that penalties should be determined according to the seriousness of the offense and with the objective of restoring the offender to useful citizenship. Defendants argued the new constitution made Ill Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-4 unconstitutional by making consecutive sentences mandatory and by imposing a penalty before the trial court had evaluated the seriousness of the offense and the possibility of rehabilitation of the offender. The court held that the new Constitution did not require the abolition of consecutive sentences, because to do so would render the courts powerless to impose punishment upon a person who committed a crime while incarcerated, and ch. 38, para. 1005-8-4(g) and (f) were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff owner brought suit for damages for an allegedly unlawful detention of his car. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) entered judgment in favor of defendant city. The city police department seized the owner's car after it was identified by license number and physical description as having been used in an armed robbery. The city claimed that the car was released to the sheriff under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 36--1 (1969).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner argued that the police violated the applicable statute, which he claimed was unconstitutional. The owner was never charged with any crime concerning the robbery. The evidence showed that the owner tried to recover the car. The court determined that the car was simply held by the police and not delivered to the sheriff which started the process prescribed in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 36--1, 36--2 (1971). In view of the violation of the statute, the court ruled that the detention was unlawful. The court held that the owner proved no damages. There was no evidence that he ever rented another car. The owner claimed that he left his job as a salesman with a life insurance company because he could not perform it without his car. A police officer testified that the owner told him he was unemployed and looking for work on the date of the robbery. The court accepted the finding that the evidence was insufficient proof of claimed damages. Accepting the finding that the owner did not prove other claimed damages, the court ruled that the owner was entitled to nominal damages. The court added that it did not pass on any of the constitutional questions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause with directions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The municipality filed charges against defendants for placing mobile homes on property that was not zoned for such use in violation of Village of Cahokia, Ill., Ordinance 418, &sect; 1. The trial court consolidated the actions and granted defendants' motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the municipality had the authority to exclude a use of property throughout an entire zoning district as long as the exclusion had a substantial relationship to the preservation of public health, safety, morals, and general welfare. The court also held that the Trailer Coach Park Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 168 (1953), did not supercede the power of a municipality to regulate mobile homes. The court found that a municipality could reasonably have found that mobile homes had detrimental impacts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant first contended that Ill. Crim. Code &sect; 11-4 violated the due process clauses of both the United States and Illinois constitutions because it was vague, indefinite, and uncertain. The court was unable to agree with defendant that &sect; 11-4 failed to meet the definiteness standards for a criminal statute. It was clear that any person of ordinary intelligence had fair notice what conduct was proscribed by the statute. The court was of the opinion that the punishment designated by the legislature for the offense represented the moral idea of the People in regard to crimes of that nature and could not have been considered either cruel or disproportionate to the offense itself. The court, therefore, rejected the contention of defendant that the statute was unconstitutional. The indictment against defendant was stated in the exact language of the statute but he maintained that it was insufficient because it failed to include an allegation that he had knowledge that the girl was under the age of 16. The court did not agree. From the record before it, the court could not conclude that the trial court acted improperly in either instance.</SPAN></P>

The employee appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Madison County (Illinois), which dismissed his complaint against the insurer under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 138-5. The employee argued that the Workmen's Compensation Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 138-5(a), was unconstitutional for want of due process and equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee alleged that the insurer was engaged in the tank car business and had sold dilapidated tank cars to the employer. He alleged that he was injured while, in the exercise of ordinary care, a fellow employee dismantled one of the cars. He contended that the insurer was negligent because it failed to indicate proper testing procedures to the employer, failed to properly supervise testing procedures, approved inadequate safety measures, and performed negligent safety inspections. The employee argued that only the employer could have been constitutionally relieved from liability when workmen's compensation benefits were paid. A common law action existed against the insurer absent the statute. However, under the Workmen's Compensation Act, the insurer acted as an indemnitor of the employer. Under the Act, the insurer investigated the claim, conducted the litigation through attorneys provided by it, paid the awards if the employer was insolvent, and provided temporary compensation. As an indemnitor, the insurer was directly financially interested. The insurer was allowed to encourage the use of various safety precautions to limit its expenditures for injuries.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff applicant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois), which dismissed one count against defendant City of Springfield. The applicant had sought review under the Administrative Review Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 265 et seq. (1969), of the denial of a conditional permit to operate a museum and gift shop. The applicant asserted that the city's action, by its city council, was administrative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city, by its city council, denied the applicant's petition for a conditional use permit to operate a museum and gift shop in an area established as a national historic site. The applicant brought an action against the city, seeking declaratory relief and administrative review. The trial court dismissed the count for administrative review ruling that the action of the city council was legislative, and not subject to appeal under the Act. The applicant appealed the dismissal of this count, asserting that the city council's action was administrative, and that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, paras. 11-13-4, -5, authorizing the city's action, was unconstitutional. The court affirmed. It noted that the applicant sought a total waiver of set- back restrictions that would require passage of a new ordinance. As the Act did not provide for judicial review of legislative acts of legislative bodies, it was the wrong remedy to review the city council's action. The court further found no violation of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2 prohibitions against class legislation or a denial of due process or equal protection of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted upon his guilty plea to one charge of forgery and two charges of burglary. The Circuit Court of Macon County (Illinois) imposed three concurrent sentences of not less than two years nor more than six years. At the time of the offense defendant was 17 years old. He appealed on the basis that &sect; 702-2, ch. 37 of the Juvenile Court Act, specifically Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 702-2 (1971), violated Ill. Const. art. 1, &sect; 18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to a charge of forgery and two charges of burglary pursuant to a plea agreement with the State in adult court. Defendant was 17 years old at the time of the offenses. Section 702-2, ch. 37 of the Juvenile Court Act, specifically Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 702-2 (1971), defined a delinquent minor as any boy who prior to his 17th birthday or girl who prior to her 18th birthday has violated or attempted to violate any state law. Defendant appealed his conviction on the ground that the above-referenced statute violated equal protection on the basis of sex. The court reversed the conviction and remanded the case. Although the Illinois Supreme Court upheld the classification, the court stated that the subsequent adoption of the new constitution and the specific provision of Ill. Const. art. 1, &sect; 18, prohibiting a denial of equal protection on account of sex was applicable in the instant case. Section 702-2, ch. 37 was clearly a denial of equal protection based upon a classification by the State on account of sex, which was unconstitutional. Defendant was entitled to the procedural protection of the Juvenile court Act before prosecution as an adult.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the lower court, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty to forgery and burglary was reversed. The case was remanded to the lower court with directions to afford defendant those rights under the Juvenile Court Act he would have had but for the denial of equal protection as of the date of the offenses, notwithstanding the present age of defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court noted that the issue of the officer's reinstatement was still pending. With regard to the amount of the officer's pension if he chose to retire in lieu of his disability pension, the trial court held that the officer's regular pension was 50 percent of the salary attached to the rank of patrolman held by the officer for one year immediately prior to his retirement. Defendants contended that the pension should have been based on the salary attached to the officer's rank for one year immediately prior to his disability leave, with the result that his regular pension would have been the same amount as his disability pension. The court rejected defendants' argument and affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court initially determined that the controversy was justiciable because an actual controversy existed in the dispute between the officer and defendants over the amount of the retirement pension. The court then held that the trial judge correctly interpreted Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108 1/2, para. 3-114 (1969) as to the salary basis for the officer's regular retirement pension.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. The court found that the necessary delay for the trial court's deliberations over defendant's lengthy motion for a change of venue was for the benefit of defendant and was properly attributed to him. The court also found that there was no denial of due process of law by the application of the alibi-notice statute. The court determined that the trial judge's exclusion of evidence relating to an abandoned car was proper because it had not been involved in the crime and the fact that defendant's fingerprints were not found in the car proved nothing with respect to his guilt or innocence. The court also determined that the weeping of the deceased's mother, a natural reaction to her testimony concerning her son, did not result in reversible prejudice to defendant.

The surviving spouse alleged that the state's negligence proximately caused her husband's accident. The surviving spouse also filed a wrongful death action in the claims court. The claims court transferred the surviving spouse's action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parent paid the book fees and towel fees under protest.

On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal. It reasoned that the issue of whether Ill. Const. art. 10, &sect; 1 was unchanged from Ill.

Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 6-107 (1969), a driver's license was issued to him with the written consent of his father. Upon his father's written request, the Secretary of State cancelled the license. Defendant contended that the statute was unconstitutional because it discriminated between an unmarried emancipated minor and a married emancipated minor. The court found a reasonable legislative purpose in the provisions of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, paras. 6-107, 6-108(1), which permitted the withdrawal of parental consent to drive except where the minor was &quot;legally emancipated by marriage.&quot; The court further held that it was not unreasonable to minimize the amount of processing and administrative discretion by easy-to-apply requirements to determine qualified drivers. Finally, the court did not find a denial of due process because defendant was deprived of a hearing. The court held that a hearing would have served no meaningful purpose because the factual issue of whether the father's consent was revoked was not in dispute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff city and defendant theater appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed the city's complaint for want of equity and upheld a decree that found that conviction of the theater's assistant manager for a shooting in the theater could be the basis for denial of a license required by city ordinance for operating the theater.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city was granted a temporary injunction against the operation of the theater for failure of the theater to have a valid license. The city also used an alleged conviction for exhibiting an obscene film as a basis for revoking the theater's previous license. The city also alleged that the theater was responsible for a fatal shooting at the theater by one of its agents. The theater contended that the licensing ordinance was unconstitutional and that the shooter was not its agent. The theater's attempt to renew its license was denied due to the city's revocation attempt. The court held that as the city had no set procedure or standards for awarding licenses, and the city processed the theater's renewal application in an arbitrary manner, the trial court did not err in dismissing the city's complaint. The court also found that the city could require the theater to have a license, and that the theater had to apply therefor and be subject to investigation by the city. As the theater had operated for four years without a license, it was required to pay license fees for those years and the city was required to accept the fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the trial court's decision by requiring the theater to pay license fees for years of operation without a license and by requiring the city to accept the fees. The court affirmed the decision as modified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court dismissed the transit authority after determining that the individual failed to provide it with formal notice of the accident within six months of the accident, as required by &sect; 341 of the Metropolitan Transit Authority Act, Ill.

On appeal the individual argued that actual notice in the form of an accident report was given to the transit authority which sufficed for formal notice, the statute was unconstitutional, and the transit authority was estopped from asserting the notice requirement. There was no question that the individual never filed the formal six-month notice required by the statute. The court first held that the allegation of actual notice did not satisfy the statutory requirement of written notice. As to the individual's second contention regarding the constitutionality of the statute, the court determined that the notice provisions did not constitute special legislation in violation of the Illinois Constitution. Finally, the court concluded that the transit authority was not estopped from asserting the notice provisions under the statute.</SPAN></P>

At trial, the record indicated that before pursuing defendants one of the officers had a conversation with the bank receptionist which satisfied him that defendants had in fact made a deposit. The officer testified that his suspicions were raised because defendants were black men in a white neighborhood going to a bank. The trial court granted defendants' motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the stop and frisk. On appeal, the court held that the record reflected no specific and articulable facts which could have generated rational inferences warranting the stop of defendants. The bank teller dispelled any suspicions that defendants were engaged in criminal activity and the police officer's inarticulate hunch was insufficient to justify the stop. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lessee contested the applicability of the exculpatory clause, contending that the lessor, an assignee of the original lessor, could not have the advantage of it. The lessor contended that the exculpatory clause inured to his benefit because another clause in the lease provided that all agreements of the lease were applicable to and inured to the benefit of assignees. The court found that the provision was broad enough to give the lessor the benefit of the exculpatory clause. It concluded that the lessee's action was properly dismissed because the exculpatory clause was an absolute affirmative defense. The court rejected the lessee's argument that the exculpatory clause was void as against public policy. The court determined that a bill, which had been passed the General Assembly and vetoed by the Governor, could not constitute a declaration of public policy against exculpatory clauses. It also determined that a statute declaring exculpatory clauses in leases void as against public policy had been properly enacted, however, it was inapplicable because it was not in effect when the lease was executed and was not retroactive.</SPAN></P>

After all the testimony was in, the prosecutor argued to the jurors that the defense claim of a police plot to incarcerate an innocent man was preposterous. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, he argued that the evidence was insufficient, that the alleged co-conspirators' extrajudicial statements were improperly admitted, that he was improperly barred from presenting his alibi witness, and that the prosecutor's closing argument was improper. Defendant's arguments were rejected, and his conviction affirmed. There was sufficient evidence to convict given the co-conspirators' testimony, defendant's ability to cross-examine them about their pretrial statements obviated any hearsay concerns, defendant's failure to comply with the alibi rule justified the exclusion of his alibi witness, and the prosecutor's closing argument was a fair response to the defense argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insurer sought a declaration that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 141, para. 109 (1963) was unconstitutional. The insurer argued that para. 109 denied due process because there was no definition of &quot;intangible personal property&quot; within the statute and an agency was improperly delegated power to define such property. Further, the insurer argued that application of para. 109 to drafts or checks resulted in a taking of private property without compensation as the act created an irrebuttable presumption of abandonment. The court held that the entire statute provided an adequate definition of intangible personal property. The court determined that application of the act to checks and drafts did not create a conclusive presumption of abandonment. The insurer was entitled to rebut the presumption that issuance of checks or drafts under circumstances that indicated delivery constituted intangible property covered by the act. The insurer could also provide evidence that the checks and drafts were not abandoned within the statutory period.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of armed robbery. Thereafter the trial court ordered a notice of appeal filed on defendant's behalf. Defendant's appointed counsel was granted leave to temporarily withdraw the notice of appeal to allow him to file a motion to withdraw the plea. After the trial court denied the plea-related motion, the Illinois Supreme Court transferred the appeal to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court sentenced defendant to two concurrent sentences of 12 to 25 years' imprisonment. After sentence was imposed, defendant unsuccessfully moved to have it reduced. When that motion was denied, defendant contacted the trial court and claimed that his drug dependence had caused him to commit the armed robberies and had impaired him during the plea process. The trial court ordered an appeal to be taken, but then allowed the appeal to be temporarily held in abeyance so that defendant's counsel could submit a motion to withdraw defendant's guilty plea. In that motion defendant argued that he was mentally impaired during the plea proceedings; he also claimed that the sentence imposed was excessive and unconstitutional. In affirming the conviction, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to withdraw the plea. Substantial evidence contradicted defendant's claim that he was high on drugs during the proceedings; the trial court was not required to believe defendant's testimony to the contrary. The sentence was proper because defendant had prior armed robbery convictions and had used a gun to commit his crimes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At a bench trial, defendant was convicted by the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) of murder. Defendant contended that in-court identifications should have been suppressed as the fruit of an illegal arrest and that they were tainted; that the State failed to give adequate notice of defendant's statement as required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 114 -- 10 (1969); and that the evidence failed to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Three eyewitnesses made in-court identifications of defendant. Defendant offered four alibi witnesses and testified in his own behalf. The police waited in a tavern on a tip that the person depicted in a police artist's sketch was going to be there. The police recognized defendant from the sketch, did nothing at first, but then arrested defendant for disorderly conduct. Defendant contended the arrest was a sham and without probable cause and that therefore the police station confrontation with one of the witnesses, and the identifications by the other witnesses from a mug shot taken after this arrest, were tainted fruit of the arrest. The court held that the police had probable cause under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 107 -- 2(c) (1967). Defendant next contended that the pre-trial identifications were unnecessarily suggestive, but each of them had an independent origin arising from an earlier uninfluenced observation of defendant. Defendant contended that it was error to allow testimony that defendant recognized a witness without notice, but it was not made to a law enforcement officer. As for the alibi, any reasonable doubt created by it was a question of fact.</SPAN></P>

The patrolman appealed, claiming, among other things, that the orders constituted a violation of his First Amendment rights, that the orders were vague, that he was denied a fair hearing, and that the evidence was insufficient was sustain his suspension. The court affirmed, holding (1) the municipality could require the patrolmen to wear a flag emblem on his uniform because the municipality had the authority to set standards for the uniforms of the police force, and the flag display promoted the important governmental interest of encouraging and developing a sense of loyalty to the nation, (2) the record established that the patrolman understood the orders, and (3) the evidence was sufficient to sustain the suspension.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff filed a personal injury action in Georgia where the accident occurred and effected service on defendant, who had moved to Illinois, by serving the Georgia Secretary of State. After the Georgia Supreme Court held unconstitutional the statute permitting secretary of state service on non-resident defendants, defendant secured an order dismissing plaintiff's action. Thereafter, plaintiff re-filed her case in Illinois. On appeal of the trial court's order dismissing the case as barred by the statute of limitations, the court reversed and ruled that the Illinois revival statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 83, para. 24a (1965), permitted plaintiff to refile her action. The court noted that plaintiff acted in good faith when she filed her action in Georgia, that defendant was on notice of the plaintiff's claim in the Georgia court, and that it was unfair and unjust to deprive plaintiff of her day in court based on a procedural technicality. The court also ruled that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 83, para. 21 (1965), which prohibited the filing of actions in Illinois when they were barred in the state where they arose, did not apply because plaintiff's action was filed in Georgia in apt time.</SPAN></P>

The court held that this time was appropriate for an election contest. The losers also contended that the dismissal order was error because it was the Board's responsibility to bring in the necessary parties, but the Board could not because there was not enough time to serve the party and still comply with the 10 day mandate of &sect; 32. The court held that the failure of the contest petition to name all persons whose rights would have been adversely affected by a ruling was a failure to name an indispensable party. The failure was fatal to the election contest. Confronted with the fact that granting leave to amend would have compelled it to decide a contest after expiration of the time within which it had authority to act, the Board did not err when it refused to grant the losers leave to amend their contest petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board disqualified signatures because the signers were not registered voters or because they had voted in the last primary election.

Stat. ch. 46, para. 3-1 (1971), and that when the legislature intended to require registration, as in municipalities referred to in the parenthetical clause in para. 10-4, it expressly so stated. The court held that a &quot;qualified voter&quot; referred to a person who had met all the statutory qualifications to vote, including registration when registration was required in the election for the particular office for which the nomination was made. The court also held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 46, para. 10-4 (1971) was constitutional in providing that persons having voted in a preceding primary election were precluded from signing an independent's nominating petition. It was a constitutional means of protecting the integrity of the election process.

On appeal, the court noted that contrary to defendant's assertion, the prosecution was allowed to reopen its case not only for the purpose of proving formalities but also to establish the very facts essential for a conviction.However, even without the additional testimony, the prosecution presented a prima facie case by introducing the allegedly obscene film into evidence. The court agreed with the trial judge's finding that the film's narrative was merely a ploy to camouflage the explicit sexuality of the film.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the wife argued that the Illinois Workmen's Compensation Act (act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, &sect; 138.5(a) (1969), did not bar the spouse of an injured employee from bringing the spouse's own action against the negligent employer for her loss of consortium excluding her loss of support. The statute provided that no common law or statutory right to recover damages from the employer for injury or death sustained by any employee while engaged in the line of his duty as an employee, other than the compensation provided under the act, was available to anyone wholly or partly dependent upon the employee, the legal representatives of the employee's estate, or anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages for such injury. Affirming the dismissal of the wife's action, the court found that the injury for which the wife sought recovery resulted from an accidental injury sustained by her husband arising out of and in the course of his employment. The wife was, therefore, barred by the limitations of the act from maintaining an independent action against the employer arising out of or by reason of the injury to the employee.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat., ch. 23, &sect; 5111, by the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) for allegedly using the names of certain persons for the purpose of organizing a charity art auction without first obtaining the written consent of the person's whose names he used.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Subsequent to the conviction of defendant for violation of the Illinois Charitable Solicitation Act, he appealed. He argued that &sect; 11 of the Illinois Charitable Solicitation Act (Act) was unconstitutional as it violated his right to due process of law. He based this contention on the assertion that the Act was so vague that an ordinary person could not have read its provisions and determined whether his fundraising activity was governed by the Act. The court found, in light of the clarity of the language of &sect; 11, and the legislative purpose of protecting persons from having their names misused in connection with fundraising for legitimate or illegitimate charities, that the statute did not violate defendant's due process rights. Furthermore, the court noted that &sect; 11 did not deny defendant the right to contract with others. Requiring written consent was for the purpose of protecting tan individual from having his named misused. The court concluded that defendant was proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of violating &sect; 11. Defendant on cross-examination admitted to not having obtained the necessary written consent form either of the complainants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Counterclaimant landowner appealed the dismissal of her counterclaim by the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) in which she alleged that the action of counterdefendant city in condemning and subsequently demolishing her building was a wrongful taking of her property in violation of her due process rights. The city's action to foreclose a lien for the costs of demolishing the building was adjudicated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Owing to the landowner's execution of a deed in the grantees' favor, they were informed of the city's demolition complaint based on building code violations until the city sought to foreclose its statutory demolition lien. Thereupon, the landowner sought to recover the building's value pursuant to her reservation of a vendor's lien for the amount of a judgment awarded to her because she had never received notice of the demolition complaint. However, the counterclaim was stricken on the city's claim that landowner had failed to comply with the notice provisions of the Tort Immunity Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 85, paras. 8--102, 1--204, and 8--103 (1965). On appeal, the landowner argued that her injury was not one of those listed by the statute's notice sections and that her counterclaim should not have been dismissed. In rejecting the appeal, the court found that the trial court had considered the counterclaim on its merits and had concluded that the landowner's constitutional rights had not been denied. However, the landowner was not entitled to notice as a lienholder was not an owner but possessed an interest analogous to a mortgagor's which did not create a right in the property.</SPAN></P>

They alleged that the city was obligated under the relevant statute to pay them the &quot;prevailing rate of wages&quot; in the locality where the work was performed. The city made a motion to dismiss based on precedent that held the portion of the Prevailing Wage Law which applied to persons employed directly by a public body was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that amendments to the statute had extended its coverage to employees of public bodies engaged in new construction. However, the precedent cited to by the city had held those amendments unconstitutional because it had placed construction contractors and public bodies in the same class of employers where, by their very nature, the two classes of employers could not confer similar economic benefits on their employees exclusive of their rate of pay. The court determined that the facts of the instant action were not distinguishable from those in the precedent and held that the action was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

Objectors argued an affidavit submitted by petitioners was insufficient to make a prima facie case. Objectors argued the property sought to be annexed was not contiguous to the village. The court held there was no mandatory language which stated that annexation was ineffective unless a copy of the published notice was filed with the clerk of the annexing municipality. The court held the objectors were not prejudiced in any way by petitioners' conduct in fulfilling the notice requirement of the annexation statute. The court held the petition for annexation as a whole was supported by the affidavit. The court held objectors failed to meet their burden to prove that the matters sworn to in the affidavit were untrue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The school districts opposed the application on grounds that they would be adversely affected by one of the districts' existing indebtedness to the Illinois School Building Commission.

On appeal, the taxpayers argued that the statute was unconstitutional. The court, in affirming the trial court's judgment, disagreed. The court found that &sect; 35-17 was not, contrary to the taxpayers' assertions, an unlawful delegation of legislative authority because its general terms could be sufficiently applied by the Commission to carry out the purpose of the statute, which was in part to protect the State's right to reimbursement. Noting that the board had requested and received input from the Commission during the proceedings that tended to show that it would have advised against the boundary change, the court also determined that &sect; 35-17 did not deprive the taxpayers of a hearing, it merely deprived them of the relief they sought.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded, finding that the uncontradicted testimony established lack of competence to stand trial.

On review, the court found that there was no prior restraint requiring a prior adversary hearing because the arrest was made after the sale and defendant's business was not interrupted. The court found that the magazines were obscene under the definition set forth by the United States Supreme Court, which was whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appealed to prurient interest, and was without redeeming social value. The court affirmed and found that same standard was expressly adopted in Illinois, that textual material in the magazines did not bestow any redeeming social value, and that obscenity without more was without constitutional protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of an order from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which denied his petition to vacate an order that revoked his probation and sentenced defendant to one to three years in the penitentiary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant pleaded guilty to a charge of battery, he received a sentence of five years' probation. Approximately two years later, defendant pleaded guilty to the charges of battery and resisting arrest and was placed on three years' probation. The probation department subsequently applied for a rule to show cause why probation should not be revoked in the original aggravated battery case. The trial court revoked defendant's probation and sentenced defendant. Upon review, the court reversed and remanded. The court noted that defendant had been advised by the trial court where he plead guilty to the charges of battery and resisting arrest that his convictions would not be used as a basis of revocation of his prior probation and that because the promise was broken, the trial judge vacated the convictions. The court held once defendant was permitted to withdraw his guilty pleas, he was entitled to all the privileges and presumptions that the law afforded, including the presumption of innocence. The court concluded that defendant's probation could not be revoked solely on the ground that he had been convicted of other criminal offenses where the convictions had been vacated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed an order that denied defendant's petition to vacate an order that revoked his probation and that sentenced defendant to one to three years in the penitentiary. The court remanded with instructions that an evidentiary hearing was to be conducted to determine whether defendant's probation should have been revoked.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On plaintiffs' motion for an injunction, the trial court issued an order enjoining the Pollution Control Board from scheduling and conducting public hearings on the question of whether the proposed beverage container regulation should be adopted. The Board appealed. The court held that where the Board had only scheduled hearings in an effort to determine whether or not the proposed regulation should be adopted, the controversy as to whether the Board had authority to adopt such regulation was not ripe for adjudication, and plaintiffs' action for a declaration of the parties' rights under the Environmental Protection Act and for temporary and permanent injunctive relief was premature.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court dismissed plaintiffs' action against the director for failure to state a cause of action.

The court reversed the trial court's judgment in all other respects, holding that the remaining plaintiffs, including the mayor as an individual, asserted claims upon which relief could be granted. The court found that the Christian Scientist's allegations that he was forced to subject himself to therapeutic treatment and that he and others were prohibited from the free exercise of his religion stated a cause of action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district asserted that Ill. Rev.

The trial court agreed, but ordered plaintiffs to amend part of their complaint to charge the district with willful and wanton negligence, which could be pleaded under &sect; 3-106. When plaintiffs stood upon their complaint, the trial court held that no cause of action had been stated. On appeal, the court held that plaintiffs were precluded from raising constitutional concerns with &sect;&sect; 3-106, 3-108(a) because they could not be raised for the first time on appeal. On review of the trial court's rejection of the complaint, the court held that the language used to charge the district with &quot;utter indifference or conscious disregard&quot; for the minor was equivalent to the &quot;willful and wanton&quot; specification required by &sect; 3-106. The trial court erred by ordering plaintiffs to revise their complaint.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A petition was filed with the superintendent requesting an election to vote on the establishment of a community unit district embracing a certain territory.

The circuit court overruled the objector's contentions and confirmed the superintendent's decision. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 11-6 (1967) was unconstitutionally vague. The court agreed with the objectors that the &quot;special procedure&quot; portion of para. 11-6 was so vague, indefinite, uncertain, and incomplete that the superintendent could not carry out the duties imposed under the statute. When para. 11-6 was amended in 1967, the words &quot;in the manner provided by Section 12-4&quot; were omitted and, thus, references in the para. 11-6 to &quot;that section&quot; gave no guidance as to what &quot;section&quot; was being implicated.

The court found, inter alia, that the Board did have authority to order the District to abate its pollution, however, there was no direct statutory authority in the Board to order the District to issue any bonds. But, the legislature, via the Sanitary District Act, provided the District a ready means of discharging its duty to preserve the public health, comfort, and convenience by the issuance of bonds if it deemed it necessary in order to comply with a court or Board order.

The Department later filed the present action to collect the assessed costs. The trial court entered a judgment in favor of the Department in the collection action.

The husband argued that the statute was unconstitutional because the statute exempted the wife from the obligation to reimburse such expenses. The court held that the constitutional issue was properly raised for the first time in the trial court.

The executor filed a motion to strike the debtor's affidavit as being in violation of the Dead Man's Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 51, &sect; 2 (1971). The trial court sustained the executor's motion and denied the debtor's motion to open the judgment by confession. On appeal, the court held that it was obvious that under the Dead Man's Act the debtor was incompetent to testify since he was a party to the action brought by the executor on behalf of the decedent's estate.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The debtors signed a judgment note and subsequently failed to make timely payments. Judgment was confessed by the creditor. The trial court denied the debtors' motion to vacate the judgment and dismissed their motion to open the judgment. The court on appeal affirmed. The court held that the debtors' claims that the Illinois Civil Practice Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 50(3) (1969), which authorized confession of judgment, was unconstitutional had not been preserved for appeal and were otherwise without merit. The note in question contained a clause that judgment could be confessed at any time after the date of the note. Under Illinois law the debtors' failure to comply with the payment schedule allowed the creditor to confess judgment on the entire amount of the note before its due date and also provided the trial court with jurisdiction to confess judgment. Whether the clause permitting confession at any time after the date of the note was unconscionable was properly directed to the legislature, not the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court rendered judgment for plaintiffs, awarding them retroactive AFDC payments, and defendants appealed. They asserted that the award violated sovereign immunity granted under Ill. Const. of 1870, art. IV, &sect; 26. The welfare families argued that the state's immunity did not extend to a state officer when he was enforcing an unconstitutional statute or was proceeding in violation of law. The court explained that the Court of Claims Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 439, provided for the Court of Claims to have exclusive jurisdiction of causes of action &quot;founded upon any law of the State of Illinois, or upon any regulation thereunder by an executive or administrative officer or agency.&quot; Thus, the court held that the welfare families should have brought their action in the Court of Claims to provide for the orderly disbursement of state funds in the event that their action had merit.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel because his lawyer failed to challenge the legality of his arrest for a violation of a possibly unconstitutional vagrancy statute and failed to file a motion to suppress evidence obtained through a possibly illegal search and seizure. The court held that a new trial was required because defendant was substantially prejudiced by his counsel's failure to file the motion to suppress, which was not a matter of judgment or trial strategy, and because defendant was deprived of substantial rights. The court also held that defendant was prejudiced by the trial court's failure to object to allot a reasonable fee to obtain a handwriting expert and by its action allowing the jury to compare samples of defendant's handwriting unaided by expert testimony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were charged with aggravated battery. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) sustained defendants' pre-trial motion to quash the search warrant and to suppress the evidence obtained therefrom. The trial court also sustained defendants' motion to dismiss the aggravated battery counts for the reason that Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-4(b)(6) (the aggravated battery section of the Illinois Criminal Code) converted a battery into the more serious offense of aggravated battery carrying a heavier penalty when the individual harmed was known by the offender to be a peace officer. On appeal, the State contended that the trial court erred in quashing the search warrant and erred in holding the aggravated battery section of the Code unconstitutional. The court was satisfied with the sufficiency of both the complaint and the warrant and concluded that the warrant was improperly quashed because of technical irregularities not affecting the substantial rights of the accused. The basic distinction and the penalty differentiation between a battery upon an ordinary citizen and a battery upon a peace officer was a reasonable classification, not at all capricious or arbitrary. The legislative exercise of its police power in determining that batteries upon police officers could result in more harmful consequences than could ordinary batteries, was not an unreasonable distinction, and could therefore, not be disturbed on judicial review.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs argued that Kendall County, Ill., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 7.2 provided certain physical requirements, the satisfaction of which the board had determined would automatically protect the public welfare, and that because they had complied with the ordinance, they, as a matter of right, should be granted the special use permit. The court rejected their argument and held that &sect; 7.2 contemplated that the granting of permits was discretionary because it provided that certain uses &quot;may be allowed.&quot; The court noted that the very nature of a special use permit demanded discretion on the part of the board.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a decision by the Circuit Court of Will County (Illinois), which sentenced him to imprisonment for the crimes of murder and deviate sexual assault. Defendant was 14 years old when he and a companion beat a victim, who was also 14 years old, and forced the victim to submit to acts of fellatio and pederasty. The victim was struck with a metal bar and a concrete block. He died as a result of the beating.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant attacked the constitutionality of the Juvenile Court Act provision that governed the transfer of cases from the juvenile division of the circuit court to the criminal division pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, &sect; 702-7(3). Defendant argued that the statute failed to afford a meaningful hearing on the transfer because it did not require that any reasons be given for not objecting to a transfer. Defendant also argued that the statute was vague and ambiguous and that it denied him equal protection of the law. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and sentences. The court relied upon dicta found in People v. Jiles, 251 N.E.2d 529 (1969), to conclude that, if faced with the question, the Supreme Court of Illinois would uphold the constitutionality of the transfer provisions of the Juvenile Court Act. The Illinois Legislature had chosen not to require to commit to the judge of a specialized juvenile court the determination of whether or not a particular juvenile was to be prosecuted criminally. It was up to the juvenile defendant and his or her attorney. In defendant's case, his counsel consented to the removal to the criminal division.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The petition for habeas corpus was dismissed by the circuit court for appellant's failure to allege facts entitling him to relief. Appellant was in custody because he was convicted of the crime of aggravated robbery. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of his petition and granted his counsel's motion for leave to withdraw from the case, finding that no valid showing was made that either the circuit court lacked jurisdiction or that something had happened since appellant's incarceration to entitle him to his immediate release. The validity of the indictment had been confirmed and was found to be sufficient to confer jurisdiction over appellant's person. Because habeas corpus relief was not available for errors of a non-jurisdictional nature, appellant's claims that he was suffering from an unconstitutional sentence and that he was denied his right to counsel would not, even if valid, entitle him to relief under the provisions of the Habeas Corpus Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff contractor appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of McHenry County (Illinois), which dismissed the contractor's complaint with prejudice. The contractor sought to obtain payment for engineering services rendered to defendant town in connection with a road improvement project, which was not completed after a decision rendered the funding of the project unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Acting under the authority of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 139, para. 143.1-143.5 (1963), the town employed the contractor to prepare plans for public improvements and agreed to pay the contractor a specified percentage of the estimated cost. Authorization for public improvements to be paid for by special assessment was invalidated. The contractor then sought payment of the balance owing under an implied contract or quantum meruit theory. The trial court found that the contract entered into by the town was ultra vires. The court noted the hardship of the contractor, but contrasted it with the right of taxpayers. The court decided that the contractor was not precluded from recovery on the rationale that he agreed to be compensated only from a special assessment source. The court then considered the general powers of a township and its electors. The court concluded that the defense of ultra vires was available to the town because it had no specific or general corporate power to construct roads. The court did observe that a highway commissioner did have general power to incur an obligation for the purpose of constructing town roads.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court, which had dismissed the contractor's complaint. The court remanded the matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff adjacent landowners and intervening petitioner county challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Winnebago County (Illinois), which granted defendant city's motion to dissolve an injunction that prohibited the city from operating a landfill on the premises. The city also appealed from an order that denied its petition to rezone the premises.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to its authority under Ill. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 24, para. 11-19-10 (1969), the city purchased the premises for the purpose of constructing a sanitary landfill. Under the county ordinance, the land was zoned as an agricultural district with certain uses, including sanitary land fills, placed in a residual category of conditionally permitted uses that had to be compatible with the existing or planned future development of the area. The adjacent landowners filed suit to restrain use of the premises as a land fill until the city complied with the zoning laws, and the county intervened. Summary judgment was entered for the adjacent landowners and the county, but the city's petition to dissolve the injunction was granted. Affirming, the court held that in locating the sanitary land fill, the city was not subject to the county zoning ordinance. The grant of the power of eminent domain to the city, which desired to use the premises for a land fill, rendered the county zoning ordinance inapplicable despite the fact that the land was acquired by private negotiation with the landowner because the city still had the power to condemn the land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order of the circuit court that dissolved the injunction and, as a result, dismissed the city's appeal regarding rezoning as moot.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the trial court did not err in admitting into evidence the fact that defendant had been convicted of robbery. The court found that robbery was among the &quot;infamous crimes&quot; enumerated in para. 124-1, and, therefore, could be offered for that purpose. The court examined the facts of the instant case in relation to the various factors to be taken into consideration in determining a proper exercise or abuse of the discretion of a trial court and concluded that the record of defendant's prior conviction was properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

A witness was shown a single photograph, that of defendant, which had a hat drawn on it. Defendant contended that the hat served to create an added resemblance of defendant to the assailant and thus suggestively induced the identification of defendant's photo as that of the assailant. On review, the court rejected this contention, the court was unconvinced that the photographic identification procedure was so unnecessarily suggestive that it was conducive to irreparable mistaken identification. The court noted that while at the time of the identification only defendant's picture was exhibited, it had to be remembered that in the time frame between the crime and the initial identification, the witness had been presented with literally &quot;thousands&quot; of photos. In light of the court's conclusion that the photographic identification was not violative of defendant's right to due process, the court refused to find that the subsequent lineup identification was tainted thereby.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tenant failed to pay her rent, and the landlord instituted its action against her. She filed a counterclaim that alleged the rental policy of the landlord, a county housing agency, was unconstitutional and sought damages. Upon review, the court affirmed. It found that the Forcible Entry and Detainer Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 57, para. 5 (1969) placed procedural restrictions on the filing of counterclaims in detainer actions. Specifically, it restricted counterclaims to matters that were germane to the distinctive purpose of the proceeding. A counterclaim could assert a paramount right of possession, deny the breach of any agreement that vested possession in the landlord, or question the basis upon which the landlord's right of possession was founded. As the tenant's counterclaim sought declaratory relief and money damages, the court found that it had no real relation to the possessory rights of the parties and was not germane to the proceedings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband had filed for divorce and the wife sought separate maintenance, which was granted to her. Four years later, the husband sought to set aside the decree of separate maintenance or grant a divorce. The trial court denied the motion. The husband argued that the intent of the Separate Maintenance Statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 68, para. 22 (1967) was solely to preserve the marital relation and to hold the way open for marital reconciliation. He suggested that there was no hope of reconciliation and the purposes of the statute were not served. He argued that the failure to have a time limit on the separate maintenance agreement rendered the statute vague and uncertain and deprived him of his constitutional rights. The court affirmed the judgment and upheld the constitutionality of the statute. It was sufficient to say that the statute was not unreasonable in the light of legislative objectives and the statute was within the province of legislative power. The statute was not a restriction or condition of the right of access to divorce because it could have been used by the party who was without fault.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wrecking company and court appointed receiver entered into two contracts for the demolition of two buildings located on two separate parcels of land. The company obtained two orders in which the trial court found that the buildings had been demolished and ordered the receiver to execute two trust deeds to secure payment. After learning of problems with the fill material used, the receiver's certificates were not paid. Thereafter, the company filed suit seeking a foreclosure of each trust deed. The trial court rejected the receiver's affirmative defenses and ordered foreclosure and sale of the two parcels of real estate. The receiver sought review contending, inter alia, that the company's action was time-barred. Reversing the trial court's judgment, the court held that the limitation period did not apply to receiver's certificates issued prior to August 5, 1965. The court held that despite the court order that authorized him to execute trust deeds, the receiver could not convey and warrant legal title to the parcels that the wrecking company sued to foreclose.

The complaint charged defendant with knowingly and unlawfully selling a quantity of amobarbital and secobarbital otherwise than as authorized in the Drug Abuse Control Act and in violation of Ill.

The trial court found no unequivocal language in the Act that compelled compels a depressant or stimulant drug as statutorily defined to be dispensed by a pharmacy pursuant to a written prescription. It found that if the legislature had meant for a pharmacy to first secure a prescription, it could have said so with ease. On review, the court recited the pertinent statutory provisions of the Act and found that the complaint did state an offense against defendant as a &quot;person&quot; under the Act. It held that defendant's license as an apprentice pharmacist did not exempt him from a violation of the Act because he was not acting in the ordinary or authorized course of his business, profession, occupation or employment and had not received a valid prescription.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners claimed that a real estate tax assessment was void because the property was exempt by reason of condemnation proceedings, the affidavit in support of the deed as false, there was a recorded and existing mortgage, petitioners had no notice of the tax proceedings, and the certificate of forfeiture was not properly filed and recorded under the Torrens System. The trial court sustained the purchasers' motion to strike and dismiss the amended petition. On appeal, petitioners contended that the trial court erred in dismissing the amended petition because issues of fact relating to the trial court's lack of jurisdiction were presented by the pleadings. The court held that the trial court acquired jurisdiction over the land in the original application for judgment and order of sale; therefore, the trial court had jurisdiction to enter an order finding that all required notices had been given, that all provisions of the law had been complied with, and that a tax deed had issued. Because the tax deed judgment was not appealed, it was incontestable by petitioners.</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged that his arrest was unlawful and that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence of the knife. The court held that the arrest was lawful because the officer identified defendant by the first victim's description. Because the arrest was lawful, the search was lawful. Defendant alleged that he did not knowingly and understandingly waive his right to a jury trial. The court held that defendant knowingly waived his right to a jury trial.

He argued that during his service he compiled an exemplary record for attendance, punctuality and efficiency, that he received two commendations for outstanding performance in duty, and that he had never been suspended, except for the six-day suspension that formed the basis of his complaint. The court reversed the judgment because it was unable to create a cause of action for full judicial review of suspensions under seven days when suspensions for more than seven days only entitled the alleged injured party to a hearing before the Civil Service Commission. The court found that internal discipline was necessary for the efficient and effective administration of government.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant municipality sought review of an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which found that Village of Glencoe, Ill., Amended Zoning Ordinance, art. VI, &sect; 4 (1959) was unconstitutional as applied to plaintiff landowner's property and granted a variance to the landowner, in the landowner's declaratory judgment action to have the ordinance declared null and void as applied to her property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The municipality appealed from the trial court's judgment declaring that a zoning ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to the landowner's property, in the landowner's declaratory judgment action. The ordinance required 5 foot sideyards on the property, in the event of a construction of a residence. The property measured 25 feet in width. The trial court's order enabled the landowner to construct a residence 19 feet wide with sideyards of 3 feet. On appeal, the court noted that the trial court's conclusion that the amended ordinance did not apply to the landowner's lot because it was platted and recorded prior to enactment of the ordinance was erroneous. The court noted that a landowner did not acquire an irrevocable right simply by virtue of the plat's recordation under the Plat Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 109, para. 1 et seq. (1965). However, the court held that the trial court properly found that ordinance was arbitrary, discriminatory, and unreasonable as applied to the landowner's property. Thus, the court affirmed, after modifying the trial court's order to restrict the landowner from constructing a house directly adjacent to a house located immediately to the east.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, business operator, challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Rock Island County (Illinois) upholding the validity of the liquor ordinance enacted by defendant City, as Moline, Ill., Liquor Control Ordinance, and rendering judgment for the City. The City filed a motion to dismiss the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The business operator had filed a declaratory action alleging that her business was licensed to sell food and beverage and did not sell liquor at retail. The complaint further alleged that the business operator was notified that she was to comply with the ordinance or face charges for violating it. She asserted that the ordinance was beyond the scope of the City's police power and was an unconstitutional deprivation of property with due process. On appeal, the court dismissed the appeal for mootness. It reasoned that the City had enacted a new ordinance that dealt with alcoholic beverages and repealed the old ordinance and that the business operator's questions were moot. Moline, Ill., Code &sect; 5-38 specifically provided for the sale and dispensing of liquor at retail and included the pouring of liquor and the providing of set-ups that contained alcoholic liquor. The new ordinance was more carefully drawn and the questions raised by the business operator would no longer exist. Since the existence of a real controversy was a prerequisite to appellate jurisdiction, the court dismissed the appeal when it had notice of facts that only showed mere abstract propositions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the motion and dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver was involved in a one car accident. As he drove his vehicle, the driver's car fell into an unmarked rut on a public street. As a result, the car was caused to strike a pillar beacon in the middle of the road and the driver sustained personal injuries. The driver filed a lawsuit against the street commissioner and deputy commission for the city in which he sought to recover for the personal injuries he sustained. After the driver amended his complaint, defendants filed a motion to strike his complaint and dismiss the his cause of action. The trial court granted defendants' motion. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and held that defendants were immune from liability. The court noted that if every rut, hole or blemish in a city street created the possibility of personal liability against one or more employees of the Illinois State Highway Department that it would be impossible to find employees willing to serve under these conditions. Although the statute which provided immunity for public officials had not yet been enacted at the time of the driver's accident, the court stated that under the common law, defendants were still afforded immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that a conviction for battery could not have stood where the only evidence for the state was the testimony of complainant, who was himself facing a battery charge, and that it was unconstitutional for a black defendant to be tried by a jury which included one black juror. Defendant argued that that his conviction should have been set aside because he was arrested, charged, and tried without any prior judicial or quasi-judicial determination that there was probable cause against him and not against the alleged victim, and because the state had knowingly and intentionally refrained from prosecuting the victim. Defendant also argued that the overall conduct of defendant's trial was so unfair and prejudicial as to warrant reversal. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that when there was the slightest difference in the evidence as between two persons jointly tried, the trier of facts could have weighed the evidence and made allowance for such difference, and when that was done and one was acquitted and the other convicted, the fact that the evidence involved the acquitted person to some extent would not have required the exoneration of the other.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted plaintiffs a temporary restraining order.

His parents were divorced and he had lived with several different families. He had been previously convicted for contributing to the delinquency of a minor for which he served a two-week sentence. Two state investigators and a police officer agreed to use an informer in an attempt to purchase marijuana from defendant. Defendant was arrested and charged with possession and sale of marijuana after the transaction. On appeal, defendant asserted that the trial court erred in denying his pretrial motion for a list of last known residence addresses of state witnesses when there was no showing that the lives of the witnesses or their families had been threatened by defendant. The court agreed that the denial was error, but held that it was not prejudicial error and, thus, not reversible. Defendant next asserted that his entrapment instruction should have been given. While the court agreed that an instruction regarding a defense should be given where there was slight evidence upon a specific theory, it did not agree that there was such evidence in the case.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, the People of the State of Illinois, appealed the order of the Circuit Court of Kankakee County (Illinois), which granted defendant's motion to dismiss the charges of armed robbery and aggravated battery lodged against him and ordered defendant discharged because he was not brought to trial with in 120 days under a speedy trial statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 103--5 (1969).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sheriff of Kankakee County asked that another county detain defendant until the sheriff could pick him up on charges of armed robbery and aggravated battery. Defendant was being held in the other county on an armed robbery charge. Defendant alleged that his right to a speedy trial was violated because the People did not bring him to trial in Kankakee County within the 120 days prescribed by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 103-5 (1969). The trial court dismissed the charges and discharged defendant. On appeal, the court reversed the order of the trial court and remanded the case. The question specifically before the Court was when, and under what circumstances, did the statutory period of 120 days begin to run. The court held that there was no abuse of detention and concluded that defendant was not placed &quot;in custody&quot; on the Kankakee County charge on the date the complaint and warrant were sent to the other county. The commencement of the period of 120 days began when the Kankakee County authorities took defendant from the other county on the complaint and warrant. When that was done, defendant was in custody on the Kankakee County charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the decision of the Municipal Division of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted him of disorderly conduct in violation of Chicago, Ill., Mun. Ct. R. 193-1(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a 19-year old student, was arrested at the scene of a riot, which involved a mob of 600 people. Defendant asserted that he was there only to take pictures. At trial, defendant was the only witness on his behalf. Defendant argued that the disorderly conduct statute was constitutionally vague and that the complaint was legally insufficient. The court affirmed his conviction. Although the question of the constitutionality of the ordinance and the legal sufficiency of the complaint was not raised by defendant at the trial or in a motion for new trial, the court nevertheless held that the ordinance was constitutional. The disorderly conduct ordinance adequately advised defendant of the nature of the offense he was charged with and was adequate to enable him to prepare a defense. There was sufficient evidence to support his conviction because he was a part of the general confusion when the trouble began, and his presence in the rampaging mob lent aid to those bent on destruction by limiting the ability of the police to restore order. The court determined that defendant was guilty of disorderly conduct by a clear preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed because the amended complaint failed to establish that the decisions issued by the board in any way affected the districts in which the objector resided. The allegations that the proceedings of a committee included the intent of detaching further territory from school districts causing tax losses were far too vague and conjectural to establish the right to bring the suit.

Stat. ch. 75, &sect; 19 (1967), a prisoner was not liable for the cost of his maintenance and medical care. Furthermore, &sect; 10-4 and &sect; 11-1 of the Mental Health Code suggested that the Code did not apply to persons charged with a felony. Therefore, the court concluded that the same rules that governed the liability of a prisoner for his medical care were also applicable to a person held in custody after being charged with a felony. For that reason, the Department was not entitled to seek reimbursement from the conservator.</SPAN></P>

Following a hearing as to aggravation and mitigation, the trial court sentenced defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the record did not support defendant's arguments that his counsel misrepresented the length of the sentence he would receive on a guilty plea, that his trial counsel was inadequate, and that he was not adequately advised with reference to his plea of guilty. The court further held that the hearing in mitigation and aggravation was sufficient to enable the trial court to arrive at an intelligent determination concerning sentencing, noting that the trial court considered the moral character, life, family, occupation, and criminal record of the defendant, as well as the fact that he had killed his wife, the mother of three children, even though there had not been any argument between them. The court also held that Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff had been actively engaged as a practicing psychologist since 1953 and he had completed 32 hours of post-graduate studies at approved schools by 1954. Plaintiff did not receive a Master's degree because he failed to intern at a state hospital for one year. After the Act was enacted, plaintiff was notified that he would be arrested if he continued to practice psychology without a Master's degree in violation of the Act. Plaintiff was also informed that in order to receive a Master's degree he would have to retake all of his post-graduate courses. Plaintiff filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and writ of injunction. The court held that the requirement that plaintiff possess a Master's degree to qualify for registration was unreasonable, arbitrary, and denied him due process of law because it effectively excluded him from continuing to practice without providing an alternative method for evaluating his ability. However, the court reversed the order that a writ of injunction be issued compelling defendants to issue to plaintiff the requisite certificate and remanded for evaluation of plaintiff's qualifications by the Department of Registration and Education.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">No one objected to the bank's application for a variance to erect two floors on its building, but the Board denied it. The bank appealed. The trial court found that the evidence sustained the finding of practical difficulties and unique hardship in that the property, by reasons of unique circumstances, could not yield a reasonable return under the limitations imposed, and that the requested variance would not alter the essential character of the area. The trial court also found that the denial of variance was arbitrary, unreasonable, and against the manifest weight of the evidence, that the bank would suffer irreparable damage and that the ordinance, as directed to the described property, was unconstitutional as not reasonably related to public health, safety, or welfare. The court affirmed. The court stated that the bank produced substantial, positive evidence of facts that justified the trial court in finding that the bank had met the statutory test and that the Board had abused its discretion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The motorist applied for registration of his vehicle and for the privilege of operating it on public highways in the state during 1952 and was given notice that additional taxes based on an amendment to the Motor Vehicle Act might be due if a tax increase held invalid by the circuit court was sustained on appeal. After the amendment was held constitutional, the state commenced an action against the motorist in 1955 to collect the tax. Service of summons was not effected on the motorist until 1967. The trial court granted the motorist's motion to dismiss based on lack of diligence in serving process pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 4. On appeal, the court reversed and ruled that the state was not bound by the procedural requirement of reasonable diligence in obtaining service of process because actions could be dismissed with prejudice for lack of due diligence only after the applicable statute of limitations ran and no statute of limitations applied against the state for the collection of taxes. The court also ruled that the record was devoid of facts on which the court could base a finding that the equities strongly favored the application of the doctrine of estoppel.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 111 2/3, &sect; 27(c) (1969) did not confer jurisdiction on the commerce commission to control the railroad's disposition of real estate if such disposition was neither necessary nor useful to the public.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court granted the railroad's motion for summary judgment, finding that &sect; 27 did not apply to real estate. The trial court also concluded that &sect; 27 provided no standards and, therefore, violated Ill. Const. art. 3. The commission and the attorney general filed a notice of appeal with the supreme court and the supreme court transferred the case to the court on the ground that it had no jurisdiction on direct appeal. The basis of the direct appeal was that the case involved constitutional questions. The court first determined that it would be improper to presume any substantive ruling by the supreme court from the mere fact of a transfer which provided no instruction and said nothing more than that in the supreme court's opinion no direct appeal jurisdiction existed. The court held that constitutional issues should not be considered unless necessary to the disposition of the case. The court then determined that precedent required that &sect; 27 be interpreted as applying to real estate. Finally, the court concluded that the term &quot;reasonably&quot; in the statute provided sufficient guidelines and that the grant of power was not an unconstitutional delegation of authority.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the pertinent zoning ordinance as applied to the corporation's property was invalid and ordered the county to issue the special-use permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation argued that the trial court properly ordered the issuance of the special-use permit. The corporation challenged the constitutionality of the underlying zoning classification as applied to its property. Finding no error in the trial court's judgment, the court affirmed. In deciding whether the ordinance was constitutional, the court considered the character of the surrounding neighborhood. There were at least five gravel pits in the vicinity of the subject property. There were a few scattered residences within a few miles. The corporation contended that there was a great shortage of sand and gravel in the area. Testimony was predominately that there presently was, or there would be in the future, need to have sand and gravel removed for construction needs of the public. If its removal was denied, then the aggregate will be lost to both the owner and the public. The court held that the corporation had sustained its burden of proving that the county's action in denying the special-use permit was arbitrary and unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant alleged that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the substance in question was marijuana, that the trial court erred in not submitting an instruction defining marijuana in accordance with the statutory requirements, and that the statute classifying marijuana as a narcotic was unconstitutional. In denying defendant's petition for rehearing, the court ruled that a crime laboratory analyst's testimony identifying the substance found in the possession of defendant as marijuana was sufficient. The court also disagreed with defendant's argument that possession of marijuana was not a criminal offense unless it was of the specific quality and kind defined by the law. The court ruled that all cannabis was subject to the law, excluding the specific exceptions listed in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, &sect;&sect; 22-44 (1967). The proof was sufficient to sustain the guilty finding, and defendant did not bring himself within the statutory exceptions. Since no issue was raised disputing the nature of the drugs involved, no further instruction was needed. The constitutionality of the law defining marijuana as a narcotic drug was not open for the court's consideration.</SPAN></P>

Respondents challenged certain evidentiary rulings and claimed that the statute authorizing petitioner to condemn land for a fee-based golf course was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondents claimed that petitioner's experts impermissibly based their opinions of value on negative factors in the area, like the lack of transportation, shopping, sewer and water. Respondents were not allowed to ask those experts, hypothetically, if they would have valued the land differently if they knew that all 41 parcels were under common ownership. Respondents were also prevented from asking whether the experts had considered the probability of rezoning in their valuations, and as a sanction for failure to provide opposing counsel with the appraisals of their experts, the trial court excluded one of respondents' experts. The court found no taint on the constitutionality of the statutory authorization to charge a fee for the use of a public facility because public funds were to be used to acquire the subject land. It held that petitioner's experts considered the factors normally relevant to proving market value, including negative and positive elements, and that respondents' questions to those experts were properly limited. The court agreed with the trial court's sanction and held that the verdict was not the result of passion, prejudice, or a clear and palpable mistake.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The temporary injunction prohibited defendants from advocating or inducing the union membership to strike. After the union went on strike, the parties resolved their contract dispute. The board then filed a motion to dissolve the injunction. The trial court refused to grant the motion. Instead, it issued a rule to show cause and appointed amicus curiae to investigate the violation of the injunction. It found defendants in contempt. Defendants argued that the contempt was civil in nature and was moot at the time of its prosecution. The court affirmed the judgment of contempt and the sentence. The court held that the trial judge did not err in issuing the rule to show cause, in appointing the amicus curiae, and in entering the contempt judgment. The court stated that under no theory could a party which obtained an injunction bind the issuing court with condonation of contemptuous or illegal acts of those who violated the court's order. To give effect to such a theory would usurp the highest function of the courts.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also argued that the trial court applied an irrational presumption which denied him due process of law when it ruled he should have produced evidence as to purchase or acquisition within 10 days of his arrest for failure to register. Defendant also assailed the validity of &sect; 7 by contending that the city lacked power to enact the legislation. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction because defendant failed to preserve his self-incrimination argument for appeal, once defendant's possession was established the trial court was correct in inferring that defendant had purchased or otherwise acquired the firearm from someone other than a licensed dealer, and &sect; 7 was a valid exercise of the city's police power.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was taken to a hospital and, while there, an officer inquired defendant of his need for care. In replying to such query, defendant volunteered that he had shot his wife. Defendant had not been given Miranda warnings prior to the statement. Defendant's statement was admissible: he was not in custody when it was made; there was no evidence other than that defendant spoke spontaneously and; there were no questions asked of defendant concerning incriminating facts. Further, because quarrelsome words did not constitute such provocation as to make homicide voluntary manslaughter, the prosecutor's argument to the jury was proper. The indictment, which stated that defendant killed his wife without lawful justification by shooting her with a gun, knowing that such action created a strong probability of death or great bodily harm, was properly worded under Ill.

The judge did not ask defendant on the record whether he wanted to waive that right; the judge told defendant to sign the form if he wished to waive trial by jury. The waiver was not read to defendant, and there was no indication that he read it himself or understood it. On appeal, defendant contended that he did not expressly and understandingly waive his right to a jury trial. The court held that the record was insufficient to prove that defendant's waiver was understandingly made. Although it could be inferred from the presence of counsel and the fact that defense counsel had discussed the waiver of a jury with defendant and his parents that defendant knew and understood what he was doing by signing the printed waiver, the fact that no express statement of understanding of the waiver was made on the record was enough to justify reversal of the conviction.

The substance was, in fact, non-narcotic. He was convicted of selling a non-narcotic substance after agreeing to sell narcotic drugs, in violation of Ill Rev Stats. ch. 38, para. 22-40 (1967). He claimed there was no proof adduced he knew the substance was a non-narcotic, that evidence admitted as to his prior sales of narcotics deprived him of a fair trial, and the provisions of the Ill Rev Stats. ch. 38, art. 22 were unconstitutional. The court rejected all these arguments and affirmed his conviction and sentence.

Because an adjudication of unconstitutionality would have permitted the elector to be eligible for service on the commission, the case provided for an immediate determination of legal rights of the parties in an adversary proceeding and, therefore, warranted application of the Declaratory Judgment Act. The ordinance also presented a continuing controversy which, unless resolved, would have been capable of repetition, but evading review. Moreover, the elector had standing. The elector would have been eligible to hold office on the commission but for the ordinance. Because persons could not be barred from holding public office by criteria forbidden by the Constitution, he had a constitutional right to vindication and a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court dismissing the elector's complaint against the village and remanded the cause with directions to reinstate the complaint and consider the merits of the constitutional issues presented.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The complaint alleged that the director, at the offices of the board and in the presence of other persons, made a slanderous statement against the employee. The board and the director brought a motion to strike the complaint and dismiss the action, asserting that the action was expressly barred by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 85, para. 2-107 (1967) and Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 85, para. 2-201 (1967). The trial court granted the motion to strike and dismissed the action. The employee contended for the first time on appeal that &sect;&sect; 2-107, 2-201 of the Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 85, paras. 2-107, 2-201(1967), were unconstitutional. The court held that constitutional questions were not reviewable by it under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 302(a) and that a transfer under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 365(b) was futile because the question was raised for the first time on appeal. Because Ill. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty to three charges of unlawful possession of narcotic drugs and was sentenced to two to four years on each charge, to be served concurrently. Defendant argued that he was not given a mitigation hearing and that the sentences should be vacated and the causes remanded with directions that he be given an opportunity to offer evidence in mitigation prior to being resentenced. The court observed that the burden of presenting mitigating circumstances fell upon a defendant and that it was he who had to make a substantial showing in order to justify a reduction of sentence on review. It was incumbent upon a defendant to request a hearing, and failure to do so constituted a waiver. When an accused was present in court and represented by competent counsel, he was bound by the actions and concessions of counsel, and even constitutional right could be waived. When the trial court called the hearing for sentencing, defendant was present in the trial court with his attorney. Both defendant and his attorney remained silent and made no offer of any evidence in mitigation. This was an express waiver by defendant of his right to be heard at the mitigation hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant, who worked for several years in Illinois as a dental technician, had attended a foreign dental school. The dental licensing department denied the applicant's application to take the dental licensing examination after finding that the dental school he attended was not reputable as defined in Rules V-A and V-B of the dental section of the Department of Registration and Education of the State of Illinois. The rules based a school's reputability upon approval by the American Dental Association or a curriculum equivalent to that of the state university's dental school. Experts testified the school the applicant attended was reputable but he was denied the opportunity to take the licensing examination. On appeal, the court affirmed the order in the applicant's favor, finding that the rules under which he was denied admission to the examination were invalid because they arbitrarily and unreasonable delegated the licensing department's power to determine the reputability of a foreign dental school. Since the applicant established through expert testimony that the school he attended was reputable, the court held that he was entitled to take the licensing examination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 624 (1957), the case should not have been assigned to a magistrate since the maximum penalty for the offense charged exceeded that which magistrates were entitled to hear. However, no objection was made to the assignment before the trial began. The magistrate, as a full judicial officer, had the power to hear cases, with the consent of defendant. By failing to object, defendant waived any right to have the case heard by a judicial officer other than a magistrate. Defendant then argued that his motion to suppress should have been allowed. The court found that the officer, who witnessed defendant make five transactions within a 25-minute period, had sufficient probable cause to make the arrest. Thus, the motion to suppress was properly denied. Finally, defendant was bound by the jury waiver understandingly made through his attorney. Defendant was present; there was no indication that he was illiterate; and he remained silent while the attorney made the waiver.

A suitcase in defendant's bedroom and the paper bag that defendant dropped contained a crushed green plant substance that was determined to be marijuana. On appeal, the court found that the term possession used in the indictment implicitly meant knowing possession, so that the indictment was valid although it did not expressly allege that defendant had knowledge of the marijuana found within his control.

On appeal, defendant's central theme was that he should not have been convicted for acts that were compelled by his narcotics addiction. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held (1) the conviction was proper because defendant was not convicted for being an addict, but for selling and possessing narcotics; (2) defendant was not entrapped because he was not induced to commit a crime, and, when afforded the opportunity to do so, he did not hesitate; (3) the trial court was not obligated to give more than one instruction on entrapment because the instruction given adequately covered the law, was fair to both sides, and enabled the jury to accept either defendant's or the State's version of the transaction; (4) based on the evidence surrounding the sale, the things defendant did and said, and the testimony of a psychiatrist, the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was not insane at the time of the offense; and (5) an improper argument by the State did not require reversal because it did not substantially prejudice defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In order to induce the broker to stop soliciting real estate deals, the association initiated a program of picketing and leaflet distribution in the areas near the broker's home.

I and XIV. The court found that the trial court correctly determined that the association's activities invaded the broker's right to privacy. Furthermore, the court determined that the injunction was not overbroad. The public policy of the state strongly favored protection of privacy of home and family from encroachments of the nature of the association's activities.

The buyers also appealed the order which dismissed their action against defendant escrowee for refusing to return their earnest money. The seller moved for a new trial in the event that the trial court's judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to a purchase contract, the buyers deposited earnest money with the escrowee. When the seller failed to perform two conditions of the contract, the buyers rescinded the contract and demanded return of the earnest money. The escrowee refused to return it. The buyers filed suit. The trial court ordered the escrowee to deposit the earnest money with the court clerk and dismissed the action against him. The jury found for the buyers as against the seller. The trial court, however, entered a judgment notwithstanding verdict (jnov). On appeal, the court reversed the jnov and denied the seller's motion for a new trial. Because the escrowee admittedly had no claim to the money, the order allowing him to deposit the money with the clerk disposed of him, as to any claim by the buyers for the return of the money, and he was properly dismissed from the case. Once the seller argued waiver to the jury, the position that the affirmative allegations of its answer stood admitted by the buyers' failure to deny the same was abandoned. There was substantial evidence to support the jury's verdict. There was no abuse of discretion in denying the seller's motion for a continuance.</SPAN></P>

The park brought an action for mandamus and for an injunction. The trial court granted the city's motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint in mandamus. The court held that mandamus was an extraordinary remedy for which a petitioner must show a clear and undoubted right to the relief demanded. The court reversed the dismissal of the injunction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation and its principal stockholder owned three lots of property, designated lots 12, 13, and 14. Thereafter, the stockholder purchased lot 16 and obtained an option to purchase lot 15. The stockholder then filed a petition to rezone lots 12-16 to a commercial use. In the alternative, the stockholder sought a use variance. The city denied the stockholder's request for reclassification. Thereafter, the city council adopted a new zoning ordinance, wherein the area around and the stockholder's lots were designated a historical district. In his complaint, the stockholder argued that the new zoning ordinance was invalid and constituted a confiscation of the stockholder's property. The trial court found that, as to lots 12, 13, 14, the historical zoning classification was arbitrary and unreasonable. Moreover, the trial court found that, as to lot 15 and 16, the historical district regulations were unconstitutional. The court held that pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-48.2-1 (1967) and its police powers, the city had the right to pass an ordinance preserving its historical areas.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The individuals had also sought to have the ordinance declared void as applicable to their land. The individuals had filed a petition with the village trustees, which requested that a property classification be changed from B-1, retail business, to B-2, service business. The reclassification of the property had been denied. The individuals argued that the zoning classifications should have been held unconstitutional as being arbitrary and capricious and actually designed to control the kind and number of businesses so as to create an area monopoly. The court stated that the retail business classification purported to limit service activity to that performed indoors or under cover, but the service business classification permitted service activity without such limitation. On appeal, the court held that while the designation of particular businesses as retail or service might produce some differing views, there was nothing inherently arbitrary in such a classification. The court held that where there was a reasonable ground for difference of opinion as to the basis of a classification, the legislative judgment expressed in the ordinance would be sustained.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded the trial court's order. The court found no valid basis for limiting the standing to object to the zoning given to the another's property, beyond the requirement that the landowners had to allege and prove that by reason of the zoning they suffered a special damage, different from that suffered by the general public. The court held that the owners referred to in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, &sect; 11-13-14 (1967), were not limited to those within the municipality, and that there was no reason for reading such limitation into the statute. The court noted that the desired orderly growth of the municipality and the protection of the party that sought the zoning change were adequately safeguarded by the requirement that the landowners had to allege and show a special damage in order to challenge the zoning change.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court reversed and remanded the judgment of the trial court. In adopting the zoning ordinance classifying all subsequently annexed property to the city as &quot;A&quot; Residential, the city did not exercise any extraterritorial zoning powers upon the subject property but rather exercised its zoning powers upon that property only subsequent to its annexation to the city. It was proper for the city, pursuant to an ordinance to automatically zone subsequently annexed property as &quot;A&quot; Residential without following the requirements of the state enabling statute, other than at the time the original ordinance was adopted. The use of the property by the landowners' predecessors constituted a legal nonconforming use. The landowners acquired the property and shortly thereafter applied for a restaurant remodeling permit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The administrator's original inventory was filed and approved. The United States filed a claim for income and social security taxes due from the decedent for a certain tax year. The claim was allowed in full but was subsequently reduced after a challenge by the administrator. In the interim, the administrator had filed supplemental inventories that listed assets of an additional value. The circuit court granted leave to the United States to file a supplemental claim and allowed the claim against previously inventoried assets. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the claim was not barred by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 3, &sect; 204 even though it was filed after the expiration of the claim date in the publication notice. 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 191 created a preference for the United States even when contrary to state statutes that classified claims. The court determined that &sect; 191 was constitutional. The court also found that Congress intended that federal taxes were to be collected regardless of strict time limitations of state statutes. The court further rejected the administrator's contention that the probate judge lacked jurisdiction to allow the claim against previously inventoried assets.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested after the complaining witness reported to police that defendant had stood over him with a gun and had threatened to kill him. The complaining witness identified defendant as his assailant at the police station. Defendant was indicted for the offense of armed violation. At trial, defendant denied having had any weapon. A jury found defendant guilty as charged. Defendant was sentenced to the penitentiary for a term of two years. The court held that the evidence in the record was clearly sufficient to support defendant's conviction. Further, a prosecutor's comments during his rebuttal closing argument did not constitute reversible error because defense counsel opened the door to the issue of defendant's credibility by addressing whose testimony the jury was to believe. Moreover, the penalty provision for armed violence, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, &sect; 33A-3 (1967), was constitutional. However, defendant's two year sentence exceeded the reservation of &sect; 33A-3 by being more than the maximum provided for the primary offense of aggravated assault, which was a misdemeanor and carried no more than a maximum of one year in a penal institution other than a penitentiary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The developer sought approval of a plat to develop a tract of land into 44 home sites. The developer incorporated the city's recommendations, but approval was denied on the ground that the area was flood prone and the development would exacerbate the problem. The developer brought an action against the city and its officials for a writ of mandamus to compel approval of the plat on the ground that the denial amounted to an appropriation of the property without compensation. The trial court granted mandamus and the city and its officials sought review. The court held that: (1) pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, &sect; 11-12-8 (1967), the city had authority to require that the proposed plat conform to the official city map and all applicable municipal regulations, including regulations concerning water drainage; (2) a city ordinance required that a subdivision be provided with a drainage system adequate to serve the area being platted; (3) mandamus could not be used to force the city to exercise its discretion unless that discretion had been abused; and (4) the public gain in the avoidance of flooding outweighed the developer's interest in economic gain.</SPAN></P>

The charges arose out of an incident in which a car struck two pedestrians, killing one of them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Several witnesses testified that they saw defendant's car run a red light and strike the pedestrians, carrying them 50 feet on its hood. They also testified that defendant's car left the scene at a high rate of speed. Two witnesses testified that they chased defendant several blocks until a police officer stopped him. Defendant produced an invalid driver's license. On review, the court held that defendant was proven guilty of reckless homicide beyond a reasonable doubt. A person committed the crime of reckless homicide if he killed a person while driving a motor vehicle and the acts that caused death were such as were likely to cause death or great bodily harm, and he performed them recklessly. The fact that defendant ran a red light, when considered together with his conduct after he struck the pedestrians, demonstrated recklessness. The court held that Counts I and III of the indictment stated sufficient facts to eliminate any prospect of double jeopardy. However, Count IV was unconstitutionally vague. Finally, it held the counts of the indictment were properly joined pursuant to section 111(4)(a) of the Criminal Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 111(4)(a) (1967).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed defendant's conviction for negligent driving and affirmed his convictions on all other counts of the indictment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue was whether the ordinance bore any real and substantial relation to the public health, safety or welfare when it denied permission to operate a sanitary landfill upon the property and a special permit had been refused. The zoning board denied the application on the grounds of the present adequacy of disposal facilities in the area, and the dangers to aircraft at a naval air base, posed by the United States Government, but later withdrawn. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court and found it was beyond the power of zoning authorities to deny a legitimate use solely on the ground that other sites were available where such use might be made. The physical situation as outlined with reference to the distance of the property from other residential property, the existence of natural protective barriers, amply justified the trial court's finding that the proposed use would not adversely affect the use or value of properties in the immediate vicinity and the general surrounding areas. The injunctive portion of the judgment was drafted to fully protect the public from nuisance, which might arise from an improper operation of the proposed sanitary landfill use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment creditor obtained a judgment against the county and a writ of mandamus directing the county to pay the judgment. Based on the writ of mandamus, the judgment creditor moved for the execution of a garnishment against the bank holding the county's general fund. The trial court dismissed the garnishment on the grounds that the county was immune from a garnishment procedure under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 34, &sect; 604. The court reversed the dismissal of the garnishment and remanded with directions. The court noted that under &sect; 604, execution could not issue against the property of the county, but that when a judgment was rendered against the county, the county board had to direct the payment of the judgment. The court construed &sect; 604 to mean that the county had to pay the judgment unless a lack of funds required the county to appropriate funds under &sect; 604A or pay in installments under &sect; 604B. Although the judgment creditor should have brought a contempt proceeding instead of a garnishment, the court concluded that the county was not prejudiced by the garnishment procedure and that the garnishment should have been permitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An ordinance was presented to the trustees that would abolish the office of village attorney. Four trustee voted for the ordinance, one voted against it, and the president voted against it. The president vetoed the ordinance. The trustees voted to override the veto. The president declared that the veto stood. The trustees sought a declaratory judgment. The trial court ruled for the president and officials. The court held that the ordinance was properly adopted under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, &sect; 3-7-1, and the veto was properly overridden under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, &sect; 3-11-19. The mayor had no vote on the ordinance under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, &sect; 3-7-1. The note to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, &sect; 3-11-19 explained that because of confusion under previous statutes, there the word &quot;alderman&quot; was substituted for the word &quot;mayor&quot; because that made it clear that the mayor did not have a vote. The ordinance was valid but did not go into effect prior to the end of the village's fiscal year. When the aldermen or trustees were again in session with a veto message before them, they were again considering the same ordinance. There did not have to be a vote to reconsider.</SPAN></P>

However, the decedent and administratrix were residents of and the estate was pending in Illinois. In addition, the potential witnesses, defendants, and the next of kin were in Illinois. The administratrix brought the instant wrongful death action against the driver of the car in which the decedent died, charging him under Iowa Code &sect; 321.494 with reckless operation of a car by driving on the frozen surface of the river and driving while intoxicated. The complaint also charged the father with liability for the son's acts under &sect; 321.493. The trial court dismissed the action because the complaint alleged an action under the laws of Iowa, and the trial court thought that Illinois law applied. The court affirmed, finding that Illinois had the most significant relationship with the occurrence and with the parties, while the only contact with Iowa was the alleged situs of the decedent's death. The court further found that the application of the Illinois Wrongful Death Act with reference to its residents would not offend the comity of interstate relationships between the states of Illinois and Iowa.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court determined that there was no constitutional issue and remanded the cases to the court. The court consolidated the cases and reversed the orders of the circuit court. The court determined that the order of the county board of school trustees setting aside the annexation to plaintiff school district and the disconnection from the outlying district of which the territory formerly was a part, was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court found that no testimony was produced to meet the consideration and test of the educational welfare of the pupils because there were no students residing in the areas involved.

On a vacant parcel of land between the tavern and the owner's building, the operator secured a building permit and constructed a one-room addition to his tavern. The owner claimed that the tavern was a nonconforming use and could not be expanded or changed.

As a conforming use, the tavern could be expanded in the same manner as any other conforming use could be expanded. The court held that, to the extent that the ordinance delineating the antique center business center attempted to exclude the establishment of other taverns in the district, &sect; VI(B)(2) was unconstitutional.

Arguing that the complaint, which challenged enforcement of an ordinance regulating the use of barbed wire, was not substantially insufficient as held by the circuit court, the landowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner sued the city in connection with its efforts to enforce an ordinance governing the use of barbed wire enclosures within municipal boundaries. The landowner claimed that he was arrested for violating the ordinance which, in his view, the city had no right to enforce and that the city had denied him equal protection, was enforcing a void ordinance, and had damaged the landowner. The city claimed that the complaint was insufficient as a matter of law because the city was performing a governmental function for which it had tort immunity and the engineer, as an employee thereof, was exercising discretionary and quasi-judicial powers for which he also enjoyed tort immunity. The court agreed with the circuit court that the complaint was insufficient and upheld the dismissal order. It held that the complaint did not state a cause of action but rather stated conclusion, noting that a complaint that asserted a cause of action based upon a wilful tort had to allege with particularity the facts giving rise to the claim. Nor did an order dismissing the insufficient complaint violate any of the landowner's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the circuit court's order dismissing the landowner's complaint against the city based on an ordinance regulating the use of barbed wire within city limits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff individual, as the representative of a class of allegedly injured parties, appealed an order from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that dismissed his class action suit against defendants, Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County and County Treasurer (officials), challenging the validity of the County Law Library Act and the collection of a library fee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">To maintain county law libraries under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 18, &sect; 881 (1963), the courts collected a one dollar library fee from defendants who filed appearances in civil cases. After a suit was filed against the individual, he paid the library fee and sued the officials. Reversing, the court said that each member of the class had an identical interest in the fund after having paid in the dollar for each appearance as a defendant in a civil suit. The complaint asked for a declaratory judgment to stop a continuing violation of rights held in common. There was a common origin of claim and a fund from which common recovery for the class could be had. Neither the statutory scheme nor the Act's wording justified the officials' position that the legislature contemplated that each litigant would bear an equal burden with all others in meeting the expenses of a county law library. The Act provided that library fees were to be assessed as costs. The burden was thus borne by losing litigants only. As to equality of burden, an unsuccessful litigant in a two-party suit had to pay two dollars, but the loser in a multiple-party action had to pay much more.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment that dismissed the suit and remanded for the trial court to order an accounting of the library fees collected from the officials, to supervise a refund to the persons entitled a refund, to issue an appropriate injunction.</SPAN></P>

The board found each guilty and ordered them discharged. They appealed, and the circuit court affirmed the decision and the discharge. The policemen appealed again, arguing that their refusal to sign a waiver of immunity was used against them, which violated their constitutional rights. The board moved to dismiss the appeals, which were consolidated, and the court granted the motion with respect to one policeman, whose administrative review action was not commenced within the required statutory period. The court noted that the refusal to sign a waiver of immunity, standing alone, could not constitute grounds for dismissal, but there were other grounds upon which the board determined that the policemen should be discharged. The court found that the actions of the policemen violated state statutes, general orders, and the rules and regulations of the state police department. The court held that the findings of the board were not arbitrary or capricious, or contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff policeman was suspended for 30 days without pay by order of defendant Superintendent of the Illinois State Highway Police, pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121, para. 307.13 (1967) and Rule 9 of the Merit Board of the Illinois State Highway Police. The policeman sought a declaratory judgment that the statute and rule were unconstitutional. The Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois) dismissed the complaint. The policeman appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The policeman contended that Rule 9 and Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121, para. 307.13 (1967) violated the Illinois and federal constitutional requirements of due process in that notice and a hearing were not required prior to making an order of suspension. He argued that the suspension was a punitive measure and deprived him of a property right. Affirming the trial court's order, the court found that the legislature intended, through Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121, para. 307.14 (1967), to provide for notice and hearing prior to discharge, demotion, or suspension for more than 30 days, but recognized in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121, para. 307.13 (1967) that there were occasions for discipline by administrative suspension for 30 days or less. The court noted that such legislative determination had continued for many years and was unable to find that it was not a rational basis for internal administration. The court rejected the policeman's concerns about administrative abuse because there was no statutory authority for repeated suspensions upon the same charge. The court held that para. 307.13 authorized suspension without pay because the status of being &quot;without pay&quot; was an incident of suspension.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled the record submitted by the master in chancery and found that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional. It ordered that the lot owners be allowed to improve their property with a three-story building containing 30 dwelling units despite the property being zoned only for single and two-family dwellings. On appeal, the court held that evidence failed to show that the judgment of the zoning authorities was arbitrary and unreasonable when they decided that the highest and best use of the subject property was for single and two-family dwellings.</SPAN></P>

The driver had brought a cause of action under &sect; 14 of Article VI of the Liquor Control Act, Ill Rev Stat. ch. 43, para. 135 (1965) and a common law negligence cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A patron who purchased liquor from three taverns became intoxicated and was in a car accident with another driver. Illinois was the place of residence of the injured driver, the intoxicated driver, and the tavern owners. The car accident, however, occurred over the state line in Wisconsin. The injured driver filed a dram shop statutory action as well as a common law negligence action against the tavern owners. The trial court dismissed the complaint. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court rejected the application of the lex loci delicti and held it would give extraterritorial effect to the dram shop act. The wrong contemplated by the dram shop act was the sale of liquor that caused the intoxication of the buyer; the location of any injury caused by the intoxication was irrelevant. The court applied the nine policy factors in an analysis of choice-influencing considerations. The important contacts of the transaction occurred in Illinois, the parties were all from Illinois, and there was no good reason not to apply Illinois law. Wisconsin's only contact with the case was fortuitous. The court affirmed the dismissal of the common law cause of action.</SPAN></P>

The court found that neither the language nor purpose of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 22-40(2) were so vague as to fail to inform defendant of what behavior would have been unlawful. No confessions by either man implicating his codefendant were introduced. Therefore, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying defendant's motion for a severance. The trial judge did not err in withholding his ruling on defendant's objections to the admission of evidence of his codefendant's earlier sales. The facts conclusively established that defendant had actively participated in a planned violation of &sect; 22-40.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff village sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Lake County, Nineteenth Judicial Circuit (Illinois), which found in favor of defendant county and upheld the county's zoning amendment. The appeal involved an interpretation of &sect; 5 of the Illinois County Zoning Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 34, para. 3158 (1965), which conferred upon counties the power to amend their zoning districts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The village sought to have the amendment declared void and to have para. 3158 declared unconstitutional as interpreted by the county. Defendant business filed a petition with the county zoning board of appeals, seeking to rezone adjoining tracts of land. The village filed a written protest. The county board of supervisors rezoned the property except for a westerly portion of it. Under the amendment, the property described in the petition and notice was reclassified. The board of supervisors directed the zoning board to conduct a public hearing on the petition originally filed to consider a reclassification. The publication notice of the hearing did not contain the complete legal description as set forth in the original petition and in the earlier resolution. Because the last publication notice did not include the westerly portion, that property was not properly before the zoning board at the final hearing. The board of supervisors rezoned all of one tract when it had no jurisdiction over the westerly portion of that tract. Thus, the action with reference to that tract was invalid. The court did not reach the constitutional issues raised by the village.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation and individuals argued that the statute, which was the basis of the denial of their administrative review, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121, para. 6-315a (1965), was unconstitutional and void. The court found that the corporation and individuals incorrectly assumed that a determination had been made that they suffered no damage by reason of the closing of the road and that such determination was final as to them if they did not pursue the remedy of administrative review. The court held that the statute did not authorize a county superintendent of highways to ascertain or determine damages in the absence of an agreement. Where land was in fact taken, the superintendent was required to institute condemnation. Where a highway was vacated without the taking of land, the statute did not provide for the determination of damages. The court held that there was nothing in the decision of the superintendent of highways which specifically purported to determine damages except as to adjoining owners. Since the corporation and individuals could not obtain the relief sought in the administrative review proceeding, the judgment of the circuit court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The question for determination on appeal was whether a recent decision was limited to incidents occurring after the date it was handed down. In the decision, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 105, para. 12-1 (1963) was declared unconstitutional. The statute abolished the doctrine of sovereign immunity in the State. The court found that the decision was concerned solely with the constitutionality of statutes. When a statute was declared to be unconstitutional it was considered to be void as of the date of its enactment. No rights could be predicated upon it, nor could it afford protection to anyone who had acted under it.

When the case was redocketed, defendant filed a motion to dismiss. The trial court granted the motion. The court reversed the trial court. It held that the question specifically posed was whether a petition for leave to appeal from an order granting a new trial deprived the trial court of jurisdiction of the case when the petition was filed or whether the trial court lost jurisdiction of the case when the leave to appeal was granted. The court held that the denial of the petition for leave to appeal the order granting the new trial by the appellate court did not at any time deprive the trial court of jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners originally brought suit on the ground that the city's zoning of their property for office and research use bore no substantial relationship to the public welfare. The trial court agreed and ordered the city to permit the property to be used for multiple family dwellings. On appeal from that decision, the court held that the trial court did not have the power to rezone the property but only to state that the specific use sought by the owner was reasonable and could be permitted. While a petition for rehearing was pending, the city rezoned the property to a single-family classification. In affirming the trial court's invalidation of that ordinance and decree permitting the owner's contemplated use on remand, the court held that jurisdiction was retained under Ill. Const. art. 6, &sect; 9 until all issues of fact and law were determined. The city's rezoning of the property was not authorized by the separation of governmental powers. The trial court had no choice on remand than to enter a supplemental decree in accordance with the court's mandate.

The court concluded that: (1) defendant's argument that his arrest was illegal could not be raised for the first time on appeal; (2) reference at the trial to a police photograph was not improper because the picture was not introduced into evidence and the witness did not refer to defendant's criminal record; and (3) the eyewitness testimony of one identification witness was sufficient for the State to sustain its burden of proof in cases involving a weak alibi as a defense coupled with strong identification testimony.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) held that the standards of the ordinance were unconstitutional as applied to the property owners, amounting to a taking of their property without due process of law, and enjoined the village from enforcing the ordinance against the property owners. The village appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In their action, the property owners sought an adjudication of their right to construct a single-family dwelling upon an individual parcel of property held by them in joint tenancy, which parcel, subsequent to its acceptance as part of an overall plat of subdivision in 1924, was rendered inadequate by the 1946 ordinance as to both the width and total area minimum standards made requisite for the construction of a single-family dwelling. On appeal, the issue was whether a subsequently enacted zoning ordinance, which purported to restrict the construction of residential structures to property sites meeting certain minimum space requirements, could have overridden or superseded the width and area specifications of a previously accepted and recorded plat of subdivision, to the detriment of one who claimed by it. Upon review, the court held that the zoning ordinance overrode and superseded the width and area specifications of the previously accepted and recorded plat of subdivision. The ordinance's substantial and rational relationship to the legitimate objectives of restrictive zoning necessitated, as applied to the property owners' lot, the upholding of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trustee of a land trust sought to have the zoning ordinance declared unconstitutional so the land could be sold to an oil company. The court held that the evidence fell short of overcoming the presumptive validity of the ordinance. A covenant restricting the ownership and use of two of the lots to Caucasians was meaningless because it was unenforceable. A covenant declaring that the realty should be known as business lots was not a restriction on the property because it was too vague. The Village's comprehensive use plan, while entitled to consideration but was not controlling, because Ill. Rev. Stats. ch. 24, &sect; 11-12-6 (1965) provided that such plans were advisory only. The court determined that the fact that the property's value would be enhanced if a gasoline station was permitted did not make the ordinance confiscatory. The court reasoned that industrial complexes and a manufacturing plant were so far away that they did not infringe upon the residential complexion of the neighborhood, near-by nonconforming uses had little effect upon the land at issue, and the trustee's testified that the land could be developed for residential use, although that was not be the best use.</SPAN></P>
