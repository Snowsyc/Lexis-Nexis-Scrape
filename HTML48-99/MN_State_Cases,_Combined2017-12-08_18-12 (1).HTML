</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was serving two concurrent sentences. He was given release dates that represented his sentence lengths less the maximum good-time credit he could earn, calculated as one day for every two days served, or one-third the sentence length. He filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus contending that the good-time statute, Minn. Stat. &sect; 244 (1986), should have been construed to provide separate a good-time deduction to be served on supervised release. The district court denied his petition without an evidentiary hearing and the inmate appealed. The court affirmed. The court found that earned good time, which entitled an inmate only to serve his time on supervised release rather than in prison, was &quot;used up&quot; once the inmate obtain supervised release. Minn. Stat. &sect; 244 was not unconstitutionally vague because it clearly provided that good time would accrue to the period of supervised release, Minn. Stat. &sect; 244.04, subd. 1 (1986). Because an inmate was entitled to an evidentiary hearing only if a factual dispute was shown, the inmate's petition was properly denied without a hearing because it presented a purely legal question involving construction of a statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner claimed that &sect; 244.04, subd. 1 was unconstitutional on grounds that it abrogated his liberty interest of earned goodtime by subjecting him to conditions of supervised release upon his earned goodtime in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America. The essence of the petition was that &sect; 244.04, subd. 1 was unconstitutional because it made the prisoner subject to supervised release after his good time has &quot;vested&quot; and that such supervised release effectively denied him credit for his good time. The trial court denied the petition without a hearing. On appeal, the court affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision from the District Court, Hennepin County (Minnesota), which convicted him of one count of assault in the first degree in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.221 and three counts of second degree assault under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.222 based on an attack by a pit bull terrier.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to convict him and argued that the jury did not presume him to be innocent. The court found that under the doctrine of transferred intent, the fact that defendant brought a dog and intended it to attack one victim, did not relieve him from criminal liability for each victim the dog attacked thereafter. Defendant argued that the transferred intent doctrine created a presumption of intent, which unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof to defendant. The court found the doctrine did not apply because the dog actually bit the intended victim. The court found no error in instructing the jury that in order to convict defendant, the jury had to find that defendant assaulted each specific victim. The transferred intent doctrine allowed the State to prove only that defendant intended to harm someone and that the statutory definition of intent required for assault was broad enough to account for the use of the transferred intent doctrine. The court also found no rational basis to include an instruction on a lesser included offense.</SPAN></P>

The trial court, Minnesota, affirmed the assessment for street widening and resurfacing but set aside the assessment for water and sewer replacement. The homeowners appealed the assessment for street widening and resurfacing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1978, the city adopted a policy of assessing improvement costs against benefitted property whenever possible. In 1985, the city undertook an improvement project along homeowners' street. The project replaced existing sewer and water main lines and widened the street. The city then adopted an assessment against the homeowners' properties. The trial court found that the homeowners' properties were benefitted and that the market value increased because of the street improvements. The court noted that a special assessment was an unconstitutional taking if it exceeded the benefit received from the improvement. The court found that the evidence supported the trial court's conclusion. Appraisers for each party testified about the properties' market values. The city's appraiser compared two pairs of properties that sold and resold in 1985 and 1986. Each pair involved one property on the homeowners' street and a comparable property nearby. The city's appraiser found that property on the homeowners' street increased in value by almost seven percent. The trial court adopted the city appraiser's method and results and was in the best position to judge the witnesses' credibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a property owner and others, disputed an issuance of a temporary injunction by the Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota) prohibiting the use of the property for nude or semi-nude dancing or any other adult use as classified by St. Paul, Minn., Legislative Code &sect; 60.201-A without first obtaining a special condition use permit. The main issues were whether the activity was an &quot;adult use&quot; and whether the ordinance was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was undisputed that the activity featured exotic dancers who performed in the nude, openly displaying and manipulating their genitals and breasts and generally performing in an erotic fashion. The trial court had found that: without the temporary injunction the owner could continue operating his establishment in violation of the ordinances of respondent City of St. Paul, Minnesota; with the temporary injunction, appellants would merely be required to use the property in a manner authorized by the ordinances; and the City was likely to prevail on the merits. Inherent in the trial court's order was that the administrative burden of enforcing the injunction was acceptable and that enforcement of the City's ordinances was in the public interest. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's findings were supported by the record and its issuance of the temporary injunction was not a clear abuse of discretion. The court rejected appellants' arguments that the activity was not an adult use and that the issuance of the injunction constituted a taking prohibited by U.S. Const. amend. V. That appellants admitted minors did not prevent the activity from being an adult use.</SPAN></P>

He asked defendant's name and learned that there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest. Defendant was then arrested. The officer picked up defendant's jacket, searched it, and found a vial of cocaine. The court found that the seized cocaine was properly admitted. Exigent circumstances existed when the officer arrived at the apartment. The Fourth Amendment was not violated when defendant was asked to identify himself. The warrant check was justified and the results gave probable cause for an arrest. The officer could search defendant, his clothing, and the area immediately within his control incident to the lawful arrest.

On review, the court affirmed the judgment finding that the employer was liable for wage and overtime payments. In reaching its conclusion, the court held that, as to the case at issue, the employer failed to overcome the strong presumption of constitutionality accorded to the statute. Specifically, the court rejected the employer's claim that the statute violated a constitutional provision prohibiting laws embracing more than one subject by liberally construing the restriction. The court also held that the fact that the employer was unaware of the passage of the amendment did not insulate it from liability under the law. Additionally, the court held that the employer could not claim that it was immune from liability by acting in good faith on information provided by the Minnesota Job Service because the employer was obligated to determine what hours and duties the employees were suited for under state law.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 115.071, subd. 2b (1986) and negligent disposal of hazardous wastes under Minn. Stat. &sect; 115.071, subd. 2a(a) (1986). The trial court dismissed the charges on the ground that the statutory definition of &quot;hazardous waste&quot; was void for vagueness. On appeal, the court found that the order was appealable. Next, the court ruled that the sludge was hazardous waste under Minn. Stat. &sect; 116.06, subd. 13 (1986) and that the statute was not void for vagueness, as applied to the facts of the case. Because the statute clearly applied to the substance dumped into the ditch, and there was probable cause to believe defendant committed the offense, the court reversed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The father challenged the discount provision of the Tort Reform Act, Minn. Stat. &sect; 604.07 (1986).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The son, who was two and one-half, was killed when the car driven by his mother collided with the garbage truck driven by the truck driver as the truck backed out of a driveway into a highway. The father brought the wrongful death action. The jury returned a verdict for past and future damages. The trial court reduced the future damages to a present value. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for a new trial on the issue of damages. The court found that Minn. Stat. &sect; 604.07, subd. 2 required that damage awards for future damages had to be discounted to the present value. The court found that the issue of whether the jury should be advised of the discount was an issue of first impression. The court concluded that unless the jury was informed of the discount to present value, the jury might make its own reduction to the present value of the award. The court found that a jury instruction regarding the discount could be carefully worded so that it would not violate Minn. R. Civ. P. 49.01. The court found that the trial court, rather than the jury, could apportion the damages between the kin and over time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of the parties' dissolution negotiation after 29 years of marriage, the parties signed a stipulation on property division and spousal maintenance. The trial court adopted its major provisions under which the husband was required to pay the wife spousal maintenance for 10 years. Each party waived receiving other spousal maintenance. The wife later brought a motion in the trial court to change the maintenance award from temporary to permanent. In the years following the parties' divorce, the husband's income grew. The husband moved to dismiss. The trial court held that it had jurisdiction to modify the maintenance provisions and awarded the wife permanent maintenance based on her inability to obtain employment in the same field she had before and awarded her attorney fees. The husband appealed. The court noted that the parties' initial stipulation was governed by statute, not contract, thus the court had jurisdiction to modify the maintenance award. Since the wife's amended maintenance exceeded her needs, there was no abuse of discretion in making the award nor in awarding her only a portion of the attorney fees that she had requested. The trial court judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tab charged with a misdemeanor violation of Minn.

The district court dismissed the action, concluding that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, significantly impinging on First Amendment rights to freedom of speech. The State appealed and the court affirmed. The court found that the phrase &quot;interferes with a peace officer&quot; was overly broad because the term &quot;interferes&quot; reached a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. Verbal conduct could interfere but would not generally be considered an obstruction or a hindrance to the performance of the officer's duties. Because the district court did not address severability of the unconstitutional portion of the statute as a separate issue, the court did not determine whether only the constitutional portion of the statute was being relied upon for prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Acting only on an anonymous tip that a described vehicle was being driven by an intoxicated male, a police officer followed the motorist, but observed no erratic driving. The officer saw the motorist's vehicle stop for three or four seconds about three car lengths back from an intersection, and the officer stopped the vehicle. The motorist was arrested when the officer observed indicia of intoxication. The trial court concluded that the officer had no reasonable and articulable suspicion that the motorist was violating a law, and that the initial stop of the motorist was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. It held that where the dispatch contained no specific facts regarding erratic driving, or other criminal activity, the unknown attendant's use of the term &quot;intoxicated driver,&quot; standing alone, was insufficient to justify a stop. The court further held that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in finding as a fact that the stop made by the motorist at the intersection was not erratic, was not a traffic hazard, and that the arresting officer did not have a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the motorist was violating the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant disputed a judgment of the trial court, Kanabec County, (Minnesota), which, on an award of the maximum amount of damages permissible under Minn. Stat. &sect; 3.736, subd. 4(a) (1978) against respondent State of Minnesota as a result of an accident, denied him interest. The State appealed award of costs to appellant. The main issue was the effect of &sect; 3.736, subd. 4(a) (1978) on an award of costs and interest against the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court had ruled that costs were not intended to be included within the damage limitations of &sect; 3.736, subd. 4(a) but that interest was derivative of a tort claim and recovery of interest was, therefore, limited. Appellant argued that interest and costs were separable from damages and he was entitled to such pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 549.04 (1978) and Minn. Stat. &sect; 549.09 (Supp. 1979). On appeal, the court held that there was nothing in &sect;&sect; 549.04, 549.09 that indicated that any liability could be imposed upon the State for costs and interest. The State could be held liable to appellant for costs and interest only if those items were recoverable under the Tort Claims Act. Further, the court held that the legislature intended the $ 100,000 maximum limits in &sect; 3.736, subd. 4(a) to apply to recovery from the cause of action as a whole, regardless of the various categories or components in that recovery. The court also rejected appellant's argument that, given the court's interpretations, the damage limitation violated the Equal Protection Clause. Section 3.736, subd. 4(a) furthered the legitimate legislative purposes of protecting public funds and aiding budget planning.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the award of costs against the State and otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner received approval for emergency and temporary-use permits to place a manufactured home on her property after a fire destroyed the original farm residence. The county sought an injunction for removal of the home after the temporary permit expired because it did not meet the county's standards of minimum width and minimum roof pitch for mobile homes. The property owner counterclaimed, alleging that Wright County, Minn., Ordinances &sect;&sect; 302(73), 302(76) and 740 (1985) were unconstitutional and contrary to state law.The trial court rejected her claims. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, finding that the county's zoning ordinances discriminated against manufactured homes in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 394.25, subd. 3 (1985) because the width restrictions and certain other provisions did not apply equally to all homes. The court affirmed the trial court's determination that no constitutional violations existed.

On review, the court found that the provisions of the reporting statute,&nbsp;Minn.

The court rejected the arguments of the psychologist as to why he did not report the abuse in a timely manner. The court also rejected the arguments of the psychologist that the reporting statute was unconstitutional. The court concluded that the psychologist could not assert his clients' rights to privacy and that even if he could, the right would have to yield to the state's more compelling interest in identifying and protecting victims of child abuse.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of operating a daycare facility without a license. Defendant stipulated to the violation and moved to dismiss the charges against her on the ground that the statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 245.803, subd. 1 (1986), was unconstitutional. Defendant appealed. The court permitted discretionary review though the appeal had not been properly taken. Defendant contended that the daycare licensing statute denied defendant equal protection of the laws. Defendant stipulated to distinctions in the daycare facility law for providers who were related to the children they cared for and those not related to the children who they cared for and to the State's interest in ensuring minimum levels of care for the health, safety, and development of children. However, defendant contended that the legislative classifications were not reasonably related to the goals to be achieved since there was no distinction between day care, care provided by relatives, and babysitting. The court disagreed, reasoning that parents were presumed caretakers of their children and that the statute provided remedies for child protection in relation to the degree of supervision by the parents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the record supported the patient's commitment as mentally ill and dangerous and as having a psychopathic personality. Further, no inappropriate application of the psychopathic personality statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 526.09, was demonstrated. The patient had a lengthy history of incarceration and institutionalization. The trial court found that testimony by two doctors and the social worker supported a finding that appellant suffered from organic brain syndrome. There was sufficient evidence in the record to support this finding. The trial court also determined that the patient had a substantial psychiatric disorder, and this determination was also supported by the record. The court held that the trial court was in the best position to evaluate the credibility of evidence. The statute defining a person as mentally ill and dangerous to the public included within its definition a person committed as a psychopathic personality, as defined in Minn. Stat. &sect; 526.09 (1986). When evidence as to the existence of a psychopathic personality was in conflict, the question was one of fact to be determined by the trial court upon all the evidence.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff argued that &sect; 604.07 was unconstitutional. The trial court discounted the award for future damages on an annuity basis. The court affirmed the trial court's decision and found that the trial court did not err using the annuity method to discount the award because that method provided for a more even distribution of the award while a lump sum method resulted in substantial under compensation. The court also found that the &sect; 604.07 did not deprive plaintiff of due process of law because the statute was rationally related to achieving the legitimate state objectives of achieving certainty, preventing overcompensation, and lowering the cost of damage awards to reduce the cost of insurance. The court also found that in the absence of evidence that the damages were unevenly distributed, plaintiff failed to prove that &sect; 604.07 denied her a certain and complete remedy in violation of Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Home notified the veterans that they were going to be transferred or discharged from the Home due to a determination by the Commissioner that there was a shortage of space and increasing demand for nursing home care that required the conversion of the Home from domiciliary to nursing care.

The Commissioner appealed the award of attorney's fees. The court held that the trial court erred in ordering an award of attorney's fees because the veterans' claim was based solely on a state statutory procedural due process issue. Also, the court concluded that the veterans' pleading was insufficient to notify the state that it was defending a &sect; 1983 claim. The court found that the pleading made no mention &sect; 1983, the veterans did not cite &sect; 1983 and did not attempt to prove that the hearings they received did not meet federal constitutional due process.

The trial court entered a jury verdict in favor of plaintiff but reduced the award. Plaintiff's motion for a new trial was denied and he sought review.

Stat. &sect; 604.07 (1986), apportioning the award between past and future damages, and reducing the amount by plaintiff's comparative negligence. The trial court then reduced plaintiff's damages by the amount of workers' compensation he received, as required by Minn. Stat. &sect; 548.36 (1986). The court held that: (1) &sect; 604.07 was not unconstitutionally vague or uncertain; (2) although &sect; 604.07 applied only to personal injury cases, it had a rational basis and was not an impermissible classification in violation of the Equal Protection Clause; (3) the trial court properly apportioned the jury's award based on the total ratio of past to future damages and the workers' compensation benefits plaintiff received were properly deducted from the award; and (4) there was ample basis for the jury to find that plaintiff's failure to wear eye goggles was negligence.</SPAN></P>

R. &sect; 9500.0080, subpt. 1, for only 52.4 hours during that month. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the district court. The court held that Congress designed the AFDC-UP program to encourage recipients to find jobs.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employees sought review of the judgment of the Dakota County District Court (Minnesota), which imposed a temporary injunction against the employees requiring them to deposit certain funds with the trial court in an action by appellee employer to recover commissions that were allegedly paid improperly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees worked for the employer when one of the employees sought to set up a competing business. That employee was subsequently fired and the other two employees left to join the new business. The employer issued a check to the employees for commissions and was immediately granted an injunction prohibiting the employees from spending the money and requiring them to deposit such money with the trial court pending its action to recover the funds. The court held that the trial court erred in granting the temporary injunction, reasoning that the employer had failed to show that it lacked an adequate legal remedy in the attachment statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 570.01-.14 (1986) or that it would suffer irreparable injury absent injunctive relief. The court reasoned that although the employees were moving out of state, the employer could have utilized the attachment statute to prevent the removal of assets from the state pending its action. The court concluded that the employer could not obtain an injunction merely as security for a possible recovery, noting that the employees' spending the funds in question would not necessarily mean that a judgment would be uncollectable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had not obtained a permit for depositing sand on his property, which was on a reservoir. The State concluded that the fill was within public waters and had changed the cross current of the reservoir. After the jury was selected, but before opening statements, the State informed the trial court of its intent to introduce evidence of defendant's previous prosecution for a similar violation. The court affirmed the judgment except on the narrow issue of defendant's ability to pay the prosecution costs. The court stated that defendant could not argue that the topographical measurements obtained as a result of search and seizure of his land violated his Fourth Amendment rights because defendant could not show a proprietary or possessory interest in the area where the topographical studies were conducted because they were under the direct control of a government agency. In addition, he could have had no reasonable expectation of privacy in this area because he was previously informed that his filling on this land was conducted in public waters. The court held that introduction of defendant's prior prosecution was an exception to the notice requirement of Minn. R. Crim. P. 7.02.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent had worked for the convict and was murdered after he left his employment with the convict to start his own business. The convict contended that &sect; 573.02 deprived him of due process of law by reviving the widow's time-barred wrongful death action, that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion for a new trial, and that the trial court erred in submitting the issue of punitive damages to the jury. The court held that &sect; 573.02, which was enacted after the murder and provided that wrongful death actions on the basis of murder could not be time-barred, did not violate the principles of due process. The court reasoned that the expiration of the statute of limitation that had existed prior to the passage of &sect; 573.02 did not vest a constitutionally protected right with the convict. The motion for new trial was properly denied because the convict failed to show that he was denied a fair trial, as he did not allege the trial judge attempted to communicate to the jury any feelings he had about the merits of the case. The issue of punitive damages was properly submitted because there was relevant evidence regarding the convict's financial status.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Part of a storm sewer system had been completed for the city with general funds to be used to pay for the project. An addition to the system was contemplated. The city council's membership changed, and the new council resolved to impose a special levy to retire the debt from the old project. A feasibility hearing was held, and construction contracts were awarded for the addition to the system. Prior to that date the council made several unnoticed project additions which affected, for the first time, the property of the landowners. The court held that at a time when feasibility of the project was still an issue, the city undeniably stated that general financing would be used. Subsequently, after the construction contracts had been awarded and the project completed, the city contradicted itself and specially assessed the improvement. The court held that the city was estopped from specially assessing the project after initially deciding to generally finance the improvement. The court further held that the feasibility hearing could not remedy due process deficiencies concerning the extension project and its add-ons because the construction contracts had already been awarded.</SPAN></P>

The first shareholder filed the initial action and the second shareholders filed an action two years later.

The shareholders' counsel did not file a certificate and the actions were dismissed. They filed a motion for reinstatement which was denied. The shareholders appealed to the court. The court held that the dismissal of the second shareholders' case was not an abuse of discretion because they did not serve the complaint again after the initial dismissal four years prior.

Stat. &sect; 617.23 (1986). The trial court concluded that the dancers were not guilty, but before the dancers' dismissal motions were granted, the owners instituted the instant action claiming that the ordinance and the statute were unconstitutional. On the owners' appeal of the denial of injunctive relief, the court concluded that the owners' conduct was not constitutionally protected. Minneapolis had a substantial and legitimate interest in regulating the public exhibition of lewd, lascivious, or immoral conduct. The dancers' performances were neither expressive nor artistic and therefore were not entitled to First Amendment protection.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Water often drained off of the farm owners' land into a railroad ditch and flowed west onto the brothers' land. As a result, the brothers' land was often flooded, causing extensive damage to their crops. Subsequently, the brothers sought and obtained a permit to install a culvert in the railroad ditch to prevent the flooding on its property. The brothers installed a culvert surrounded by a dike. The farm owners sought an injunction directing recission of the permit and removal of the culvert, but the district court found in favor of the brothers. The court affirmed. Specifically, the court held that the Watershed Act, Minn. Stat. &sect; 112.88, subd. 1 (1986), recognized that the Watershed District was able to authorize the installation of the culvert by granting a permit rather than requiring the brothers to file a petition. Furthermore, the court found that although the record showed that there was intermittent flooding of the farm owners' lands, and the installation of the brothers' culvert would likely exacerbate the flooding, the record did not establish that the intermittent flooding would be of sufficient &quot;frequency, regularity, and permanency&quot; to constitute a taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant assaulted his mother and pregnant girlfriend. He kicked his girlfriend in the abdomen with steel-toed boots. The child was dead when delivered by emergency C-section on the day of the beatings. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the State to amend the indictment to charge criminal abortion. The court ruled that defendant's conduct came within the criminal abortion statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 145.412, subd. 1. The abortion was not performed in a hospital. The court ruled that &sect; 145.412, subd. 1, required only general intent. The court ruled that the evidence did not support the contention that the hospital's negligence was an intervening cause. The court concluded that severe aggravating circumstances justified a sentence two-and-one-half times greater than the presumptive sentence. Aggravating factors included the vulnerability of the pregnant victim, the 20-minute length of the assault, continuation of the assault despite defendant's mother's pleas and the girlfriend's complaint of abdominal cramps, and the presence of the girlfriend's three-year old son during the assault.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, Minnesota's Commissioner of Public Safety, sought review of a judgment from the Dakota County District Court (Minn.), which determined that exclusion of respondent driver's Class C license for the limited license privileges granted by Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver refused alcohol concentration testing and the Minnesota Commissioner of Public Safety revoked his Class C driver's license for one year. The driver filed a petition for reinstatement and obtained a district court order for a temporary limited license for work-related purposes. The trial court held that the exclusion of Class C licenses from the limited license privileges granted by Minn. Stat. &sect; 171.30, subd. 3 (1984), violated the state and federal constitutions. The trial court continued the order granting the driver a limited work-related license, pending his eligibility for reinstatement to full driving privileges. The court held that the exclusion of Class C licenses from the statute did not violate equal protection. The court determined that because the license revocation proceedings were civil matters, and suspension and revocation of licenses were not punishment, but an exercise of police power for the protection of the public. The court noted that the requirement that a second-time offender should not be issued a limited license until one-half of the revocation period has expired was well within that statutory authority.</SPAN></P>

The landowners knew of the zoning problems when they purchased Lot 6. The landowners applied to the town zoning board for a variance from the sale or development ordinance, which was denied. The county board also denied a subsequent request. The court held that the town and county zoning boards did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in denying the request because the landowners did not show undue hardship to justify the variance under Minn. Stat. &sect; 462.357, subd. 6 (1986). In affirming the decisions the court held that because the landowners knew of the problems with zoning when they purchased the lot, the hardship was &quot;created by the landowner&quot; and he was not eligible for a variance under Minn.

Defendant had to rip the pocket to get the stereo to fit, and he was caught outside the store with the stereo. Defendant pled guilty to theft, but argued that the charge of possession of shoplifting gear was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The trial court denied his motion to dismiss the charge, and defendant was convicted following a trial in which defendant presented an intoxication defense to the jury. The court affirmed the judgment and held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.521 was not unconstitutionally vague. The statute put individuals on notice of the prohibited conduct, possession of gear specially designed to assist in shoplifting. The language was clear and understandable by an ordinary person. To prosecute defendant for possessing an item used as shoplifting gear, the State had to prove that defendant had intent to use the same to shoplift and thereby commit theft. The limiting language was sufficient to overcome defendant's overbreadth objection. The double requirement of &quot;specially designed&quot; and &quot;intent to shoplift&quot; took ordinary clothing out of the suspect category.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed he was entitled to an instruction on &quot;carding,&quot; and on the defense of having made a bona fide and careful investigation of the age of the purchaser. The court rejected those claims. The &quot;carding&quot; and bona fide and careful investigation defenses had been abolished with the repeal of Minn. Stat. &sect; 340.942 (1984) (repealed in 1985 Minn. Laws ch. 305, Art. 13, &sect; 1). The trial court could not ignore the explicit repeal and had no option but to submit the case without an instruction embodying the &quot;carding defense.&quot; The addition of a subdivision that specified the way age could be proved did not render the statute ambiguous. The court was sympathetic to defendant's claim that Minn. Stat. &sect; 340A.503, subd. 2 (1) was unreasonable and unfair, but concluded that it was for the legislature to remedy.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and held that the trooper's reconstruction of the accident from the marks on the roadway showed defendant's vehicle was on the wrong side of the road at the time of the accident. At least one of the headlights on the oncoming vehicle, that was struck head-on by defendant, was illuminated at the time of the accident, indicating that the car was visible to defendant. Also, defendant drove the vehicle knowing that it had mechanical problems that impaired its operation. Defendant also claimed that there was not sufficient evidence to prove he had a blood alcohol concentration over .10 because the State failed to prove that the blood sample analyzed was in fact defendant's blood.

On appeal, the court reversed finding that failure to administer the test within two hours did not prevent the officer from having probable cause because the officer observed defendant's glassy, bloodshot eyes, smelled a faint odor of alcohol on his person, and observed him swaying while he dressed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first-degree assault in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.221 (1984). He appealed and the court affirmed the judgment, finding that &sect; 609.221 was not unconstitutionally vague. In challenging the statute defendant had the burden of showing that it lacked specificity as to his own behavior and not as to some hypothetical situation. The record indicated that one type of &quot;great bodily harm&quot; as contemplated by the statute was permanent disfigurement and the evidence established that the victims were permanently disfigured as the result of defendant's whipping them with extension cords. The court concluded that the language of the statute was sufficiently definite for defendant to have understood that his conduct was prohibited. The evidence was sufficient to support the conviction based upon the testimony concerning the incident and the medical testimony corroborating the injuries.

The mother moved for dismissal based on the three-year statute of limitations for non-presumed fathers pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 257.58 (1980) and for attorney's fees. The trial court dismissed the father's action, finding that it was barred by the statute of limitations, because the father lived in a group home setting and he did not meet the standards for presumption of fatherhood under Minn. Stat. &sect; 257.55, subd. 1(d), of receiving the child into his home. The mother's request for attorney's fees was denied. The father appealed. On appeal, the court reversed in part and affirmed in part, and ruled that the father was the presumed father as a matter of law. He was the biological father of the child, he held the child out as his natural child, and he met the threshold standard under &sect; 257.55, subd. 1(d), by physically accepting the child into his home to the extent possible under the circumstances. Thus, the court remanded for an adjudication of paternity.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother challenged the judgment of the District Court, Stearns County (Minnesota), which granted judgment to the guardian ad litem and respondent father, adjudicating him to be the father of the parties' child, and which denied her motions to dismiss the father's petition and to vacate the appointment of the guardian ad litem. The father brought the paternity action under Minn. Stat. &sect; 257.57, subd. 3 (1984).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother admitted the father's paternity but claimed that he joined the Navy when he learned she was pregnant and that he was an alcoholic who had never supported or shown an interest in the nine-year-old child. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The father's petition was untimely under Minn. Stat. &sect; 257.58 (1984), and the trial court erred by not dismissing it. The untimely petition, however, did not divest the court of jurisdiction to appoint a guardian ad litem for the child, and the trial court properly denied the mother's motion to vacate the appointment. Finally, the adjudication of paternity based on the guardian's motion was error because he failed to consider whether establishing paternity was in the child's best interests. He never interviewed the child, the mother, or the father. He never considered the facts of the case. He merely gave his opinion that present sociological and legal trends allowing children to discover their heritage compelled the conclusion that a parental adjudication should always be made and could be accomplished unemotionally without contacting the child. He clearly violated his duty to act on behalf of the child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment denying the mother's motion to vacate the appointment of the guardian ad litem.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Minnesota appealed an order from the District Court of Cass County (Minnesota) granting post-conviction relief to defendant. After holding Minn. Stat. &sect; 590.01, subd. 3 (1984), unconstitutional, the post-conviction court resentenced defendant, even though it was unable to make the requisite statutory findings that his early release would not present a danger to the public and would not be incompatible with the welfare of society.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to kidnapping and sexually assaulting two juvenile females. While out on bail, he allegedly committed another assault. The evidence showed that defendant had a long criminal history of violent crimes. In spite of its inability to make the requisite statutory findings, the post-conviction court nevertheless resentenced defendant because it found that the burden placed on him by &sect; 590.01, subd. 3, denied him equal protection. Defendant was sentenced 12 days before the guidelines became effective. He argued that the burden placed on him to justify resentencing under the guidelines created a sentencing disparity between himself and a person committing the same crime after the guidelines became effective, resulting in a denial of equal protection. The court found that defendant had not been treated differently than an individual who had been sentenced under the guidelines. Both had the same burden and had to meet the same criteria for resentencing. Nor was it a denial of equal protection to impose upon him a sentence that was longer under the determinate sentencing scheme than under the guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the post-conviction court's decision resentencing defendant and reinstated the prior sentence.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 115.071, subd. 2a to the gross misdemeanor of negligent disposal of hazardous waste in lieu of the charge of unlawfully disposing of the waste under &sect; 115.071, subd. 2b.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the State argued that the trial court erred in accepting defendants' pleas under Minn. R. Crim.

In reversing the trial court's decision, the court found &sect; 115.071, subd. 2b to be constitutional and found that the trial court erred in accepting defendants' pleas even if the statute had been unconstitutional, as the appropriate response if a defendant were being prosecuted under an unconstitutional statute was to make a definitive ruling on the statute's constitutionality and then dismiss the complaint. However, &sect; 115.071, subd. 2b was not constitutionally vague as it required knowledge that certain substances were hazardous and such knowledge was possessed by persons in the hazardous waste business. Finally, the State was not required to exhaust available civil remedies prior to criminal prosecution and it was allowed discretion in deciding whether to prosecute upon the presentation of evidence establishing probable cause that an offense was committed.</SPAN></P>

Among the contractors' contentions was that the damages were excessive.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence supported the jury's award of damages. The employee still had pain, had not worked since he was injured, did not receive retraining from the federal government, and a vocational specialist testified that the worker was effectively unable to work. The trial court committed reversible error when it instructed the jury that an unexcused violation of a federal job safety manual, which required that ladders were to be secured, constituted negligence per se. The manual was not enacted as a regulation or a statute; hence, it lacked the force and effect of law. Therefore, a new trial was required on the issue of negligence and causation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues were: whether the insurer class satisfied the requirements, contained in Minn. R. Civ. P. 23, for class action certification; whether the trial court erred in dismissing the insurers, against who the insureds had no cause of action; and whether the insured class satisfied the requirements for class action certification. The court held that the trial court properly decertified the class of insurers for failing to satisfy the threshold requirements of typicality and representivity. It was not error to dismiss those joined insurers against who the individual insured had no cause of action. The individual insured's cause of action was against the insurer, and the individual insured could adequately protect the interests of only those persons who had a similar action against the same insurer. The individual insured could not accomplish indirectly through joinder what she could not achieve through a class action. With the insurer as the sole defendant, only those persons insured by that insurer had a cause of action against it for retroactive benefits. The permanent certification of the class of insureds was proper because it satisfied certification prerequisites.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a husband and wife, sued for injuries sustained by the husband in a fall at respondent bank. The complaint alleged that the bank, and respondents, an architect, and a builder, carelessly and negligently designed, constructed, and maintained an exit and failed to warn of a dangerous and unsafe condition. The District Court, Brown County (Minnesota) granted summary judgment for respondents, and appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank's facility had a curb just outside an exit door, and the husband was injured when he fell while exiting. The court noted that since the bank building's completion, there was no sign warning customers leaving the bank of the step outside the exit door, nor was there a marking on the curb to draw attention to the step where the husband fell. The question on appeal what whether the statute of limitations for claims arising from improvements to real property barred a claim alleging negligent failure to warn of a dangerous and unsafe condition. The court held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.051, subd. 1 (1980) did not relieve the owner or possessor of a property improvement from the duty to warn of dangerous and unsafe conditions on the premises. Because appellants' complaint included an allegation of negligence in the failure to warn persons using the premises of a dangerous and unsafe condition, the claim was not time-barred by Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.051, subd. 1 (1980). Hence, the general six-year statute of limitations for tort actions, Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.05 (1980), was controlling, and summary judgment was improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband sought review of the judgment of the County Court, Brown County (Minnesota), which denied the husband's post decree motion requesting vacation of the decree provision adjudicating paternity of a minor child, denied the husband's request for blood tests, granted summary judgment to respondents, county, and father, and dismissed the proceedings against respondent wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband contended on appeal that the trial court erred in not vacating the paternity provision of the divorce decree between the husband and wife, that genuine issues of material fact existed as to the husband's paternity over the minor child, and that the husband was entitled to seek indemnity or contribution from the father of the child for child support. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court holding that the husband and wife were married at the time the minor child was born and that pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 257.55 (1984), the husband was presumed the natural father. The court found that the husband never appealed the divorce decree even though issues of paternity existed at that time and that the husband stipulated to parentage of the minor child prior to entry of the divorce decree. The court held that the doctrine of res judicata prevented the husband from raising the issue of paternity any further in a post decree motion. The court also held that public policy prohibited contribution from the father and that the husband's claim for contribution for child support was without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that &sect; 169.121, subd. 1(e) was unconstitutionally overbroad, and impermissibly shifted the burden of proof from the State to the defense. At oral argument, defendant acknowledged that an appeal previously filed with the court in another case raised the identical issue and agreed that the decision in the other case would control the outcome of defendant's case. In the other case, the court held that &sect; 169.121, subd. 1(e) was not overly broad or void for vagueness. The State had a legitimate interest in enacting DWI laws and the court could find no authority for the proposition that driving while under the influence of alcohol was constitutionally protected conduct. The language of the statute applied to the accused's conduct. The court also rejected the accused's contention that &sect; 169.121, subd. 1(e) created an irrebuttable presumption of guilt and impermissibly shifted the burden of proof. The State was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the blood alcohol concentration was .10 or more. Accordingly, the court held that Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court decided that the City's denial was reasonable because it was based on the findings that allowing a home to be built on such a small lot would have adversely affected the citizens' health and welfare and that the developer did not establish undue hardship as defined by Minn. Stat. &sect; 462.357, subd. 6(2) (1984) and the City's municipal code. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, concluding that the denial of the request for the variances was reasonable and constitutional. The court reasoned that the concern as to the proposed piggyback septic system was valid because the proposed system did not conform to standard construction practice and its design posed specific problems. The court also found that much of the testimony described the City's history of septic system problems that resulted from its high groundwater table and its soil composition. The court further determined that any hardship was self-created and did not constitute undue hardship as defined by Minn. Stat. &sect; 462.357, subd. 6(2) (1984) because the developer bought the property with actual notice that it was undersize.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father contended that the trial court erred in determining the appropriate amount of past and future support. Because Minn. Stat. &sect; 257.66, subd. 4 (1984), a provision of the Parentage Act, referred to expenses incurred in the two years immediately preceding the commencement of the action, the father claimed that he could not be required to pay for expenses incurred before temporary support was ordered but after the action began 15 months earlier. The court rejected the notion that the legislature established a past support right to offset older but not more current expenses, that is, those incurred after an action was commenced. The court determined that expenses justifying a past support award included those incurred before or after the date an action was commenced, so long as they were not incurred more than two years before that date. Thus, the trial court correctly considered expenses incurred during a period of time that did not precede the commencement of the action by more than two years. Because there were no findings on the needs of the parties or the child relevant either to past or future support, the court remanded the cause for further consideration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for violating a city sign ordinance that prohibited the placement of off-premises advertising signs. Defendant had placed an off-premises sign on a building he leased in order to advertise his business. Defendant claimed that the ordinance was unconstitutional on its face because it placed an impermissible burden on noncommercial speech protected by the First Amendment. Defendant's motion to dismiss based upon the unconstitutionality of the ordinance was denied by the trial court and the court affirmed. The court found that defendant had standing to challenge the ordinance even though he admitted that his commercial speech was properly prohibited. The court reasoned that the &quot;overbreadth&quot; doctrine was an exception to the general rule that a person to who a statute was constitutionally applied could not challenge its constitutionality to others. However, the court found that the ordinance was constitutional. The court reasoned that the ordinance did not reach commercial speech because it allowed for the posting of on premise signs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After making improvements to a building, a fire was caused by a defect in the ballast of the installed light fixtures. The insurer brought a products liability action based on its subrogation rights. The manufacturer contended that the action arose out of a defective and unsafe condition of an improvement to real property and that it was time-barred. The insurer contended that a four-year statute applied. The sole issue on appeal was whether the manufacturer and the electric company were persons furnishing materials of construction under &sect; 541.051. The court affirmed the determination. The installation of the light fixtures and ballasts constituted an improvement to real property. The court determined that in light of the broad view of &sect; 541.051 given by the state supreme court and the express language of the statute, the manufacturer and the electric company were considered suppliers of materials which were used in the construction of an improvement to real property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant spoke and understood little English. Two police officers interviewed him and a third officer acted as interpreter. That officer spoke with defendant off-the-record, informed him of his Miranda rights in Spanish, and identified himself and the other officers as police. When defendant agreed to give a written statement, the two officers asked question in English and the interpreter translated them into Spanish. Defendant then responded in Spanish and the interpreter translated the responses into English. The interpreter read the entire statement to defendant who took an oath that it was true and signed it. Defendant subsequently testified that the statement did not accurately reflect his conversation with the interpreter and the court ruled that admission of the statement was error because no oath was taken by the police officer before he began to translate defendant's confession. Additionally, the court found that the interpreter, who was actively working on the case, had a built-in conflict of interest. The court suppressed the statement and held that the interpreter could not testify to what defendant told him or use the statement to refresh his recollection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver challenged an order of the Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota), which dismissed his petition for issuance of a limited Class A license permitting him to operate all motor vehicles owned by his employer. The driver's privileges were revoked by respondent Minnesota Commissioner of Public Safety pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.123 (1984) and indefinitely denied under Minn. Stat. &sect; 171.04(8) (1984).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner issued a limited license to the driver for work purposes, but the driver claimed that a limited license issued under Minn. Stat. &sect; 171.30, subd. 3 allowed a driver with a Class A license to drive any vehicle for employment purposes. The court disagreed. The driver argued that the law as applied was unconstitutional and denied him equal protection. The court found that the purpose of &sect; 171.30, subd. 3 was to allow drivers who had violated a traffic law in their private passenger motor vehicle to obtain a limited license to drive vehicles that could be driven only with a Class A or B license. Those included vehicles over 26,000 pounds gross vehicle weight and buses. Those vehicles were most likely be limited to employment purposes, when the driver was more likely to be regulated and supervised. Minn. Stat. &sect; 171.30, subd. 1, gave the Commissioner the discretion to authorize a limited license for certain purposes, i.e., work, school, and chemical dependency rehabilitation. The court found a reasonable basis for the distinction in the law, and that the classification was relevant to the purpose of the law. Thus, the driver was not denied equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from an indictment and conviction in the District Court of Nobles County (Minnesota) of conspiring to rig bids, alleging error in the admission of evidence of another bid rigging incident, inadequate corroboration of accomplice testimony, abuse of discretion at sentencing, an unfair trial, and ambiguity in the indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed the conviction of conspiracy to rig bids. The court found the admission of another bid rigging incident was not an abuse of discretion. The incident established intent and common scheme by clear and convincing evidence, was relevant and material to the state's case, and was highly probative. The record as a whole contained sufficient corroborative evidence to permit the conspirators to testify against defendants. The sentence imposed was a presumptive sentence, not an upward departure from the guidelines. The indictment was upheld for it was within the four-year statute of limitations applicable to the state antitrust statute, which was more specific than the Sherman Act and therefore not vague. The multi-county grand jury was appropriate as the conspiracy covered the several counties. No reversible error was found in failing to sequester the jury when defendants consented, and there was no evidence the jury was pressured into an ill-considered verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was affirmed because defendants were properly indicted and received a fair trial. There was no abuse of discretion in admitting evidence of another rigged bidding incident through accomplice testimony because the accomplice testimony was sufficiently corroborated. The presumptive sentencing was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

After a public hearing, the planning commission voted to approve the permit. After a second hearing, the city council denied the permit. The council found that: (1) the group home would require increased police supervision thereby depriving the remainder of the city; (2) new individuals would be detrimental to the neighborhood crime watch program; (3) community fear; and (4) the group home is a business-for-profit possessing general business purposes and needs. First, the court clarified that it would consider the case, rather than send it to the district court, in the interests of judicial economy. The court held that the city council's denial of the permit was arbitrary and capricious. The court noted that the runaway rate was only two or three individuals a year who would leave the county. The evidence did not support claims of additional police calls or any detriment to the neighborhood watch program. The court further stated that community fear and the commercial nature of the home were not legally sufficient reasons for denial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Municipal Court, Hennepin County (Minnesota), which convicted her upon a jury verdict of disorderly conduct in violation of Minneapolis, Minn., City Code &sect; 385.90 (1981) and of interfering with a police officer in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.50 (1984). The trial court merged the two convictions under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.035 (1984) and sentenced defendant to a stayed term of 60 days and a fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Undercover patrol officers followed defendant's nephew to defendant's house after observing the nephew driving a scooter at a high rate of speed. The officers placed the nephew under arrest when they discovered that he did not have a required motorcycle endorsement on his license. Defendant drew a crowd when she began yelling vulgarities at the officers. The court affirmed the trial court's finding that Minneapolis, Minn., City Code &sect; 385.90 was not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court construed &sect; 385.90 to refer only to &quot;fighting words&quot; and determined that, under the circumstances, defendant's vulgar denunciation of the police officers constituted &quot;fighting words.&quot; Although the court held that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to dismiss the charges solely because she had not requested a written complaint, the court found that the error was harmless because her constitutional arguments were preserved for appeal. Finally, the court concluded that the trial court erred in failing to conduct an in camera inspection of subpoenaed documents prior to its denial of defendant's motion to compel discovery of police department internal affairs division files.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to dismiss the charges. The court, however, remanded the action for a determination of whether any of the subpoenaed information tended to negate evidence of defendant's guilt, for a determination of whether there was a reasonable probability that the material was necessary for a fair trial, and for a determination of whether defendant was entitled to a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred by disregarding the Minnesota Supreme Court's ruling on the constitutionality of a virtually identical ordinance, stating that compared to another issue in that case, the issue of vagueness was &quot;probably relatively insignificant.&quot; Whether or not the first issue was more important, the fact remained that an almost identical ordinance was found constitutional. The trial court could not refuse to follow the Supreme Court's clear holding merely because the case contained another issue. Following the prior decision, the court found the city ordinance constitutional. The two ordinances both prohibited &quot;unnecessary exhibition of speed,&quot; which included unreasonable squealing or screeching sounds emitted by a vehicle's tires or the throwing of sand or gravel by tires. Although reasonable people might differ in applying the ordinance, people of common intelligence did not have to guess at the ordinance's meaning and would not differ as to its application in most instances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners made employment decisions based their religious fundamentalist beliefs and claimed in part that compliance with the order would result in their eternal damnation. In a previous proceeding, the supreme court ruled that an administrative law judge's (ALJ) order finding that the owners' conduct violated the Act, had not violated the owners' rights of free speech, free exercise of religion, or freedom of association. The trial court's order was issued to enforce the ALJ's order. On appeal, owners argued in part that: the order unconstitutionally deprived them of various fundamental rights; they could not be held in contempt for violating an unlawful order; evidence that they had violated the order was insufficient; the prohibited conduct was not clearly specified in the order; and the daily fine violated the contempt statute. The court affirmed, observing that the owners' testified that they continued to discriminate despite the order to cease. The court ruled that imposition of daily fines until compliance was achieved did not violate Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents were the mother and father of 11-week-old twins. One of the twins was taken to an emergency room following an incident where she stopped breathing while in her father's care.

A dependency petition was filed in the trial court, and the trial court concluded that the twins were dependent children within the meaning of Minn. Stat. &sect; 260.015, subd. 6(d) (1984) because they were without proper parental care due to the emotional disability and state of immaturity of their parents. The trial court further concluded that the children were at risk of further injury if returned to their parents without intervention. In affirming that judgment, the court held that the evidence was clear that the children were repeatedly abused and that one or both of the parents were responsible for the children's injuries.

Stat. &sect; 169.121, subds.1(e) (1984). Defendant claimed that &sect; 169.121, subd. 1(e) was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not challenge the constitutionality of Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.121, subd. 1(e) in any pretrial proceeding. In its ruling following a new trial hearing, the trial court concluded that he had waived the issue by not raising it before trial. The court agreed, but decided to briefly discuss the merits of the issue raised by defendant. Defendant argued, among other things, that &sect; 169.121, subd. 1(e), made innocent activity illegal. The court held, however, that the State had a legitimate interest in enacting driving while intoxicated laws. Defendant cited no authority for the proposition that driving while under the influence of alcohol was constitutionally protected conduct. The court further held that &sect; 169.121, subd. 1(e), did not violate defendant's right to due process because it was not overly broad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for driving while intoxicated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Farmer Lender Mediation Act applied retroactively to the bank's foreclosure proceedings against the borrowers. The act was passed to address the emergent circumstances in the agricultural economy. Construing the act to exclude all debtors already subject to foreclosure, as suggested by the bank, was entirely inconsistent with the legislative intent. The contemporaneous legislative history indicated concern for farmers who were already suffering the effects of a critical agricultural economy. Furthermore, under the plain language of the act, any debtor who had not received a mediation notice and who was subject to a proceeding of a creditor could request mediation. Granting such a stay in order to allow mediation did not impair the bank's contract on the debt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his passenger unsuccessfully tried to climb a sand pile with defendant's four-wheel drive vehicle. Defendant was convicted for reckless driving, a violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.13, subd. 1 (1984). The court affirmed. Defendant was subject to the reckless driving statute,&nbsp;&sect; 169.13, subd. 1 (1984), even though he was driving on private property, as nothing in the statute limited its application to the operation of a vehicle on a public road. Further, Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.02, subd. 1 (1984) expressly provided that the reckless driving statute applied to reckless driving that occurred anywhere within the state and did not limit reckless driving to a public road. Because Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 169.13, subd. 1, 169.02, subd. 1, were free from ambiguity, the court could only enforce the statutes literally as they were read. The prosecutor's conduct in admitting into evidence photographs that did not accurately depict the area where the incident occurred was not so prejudicial as to require a new trial. Defendant's passenger and the sheriff testified that the photographs accurately represented the scene of the incident and the shifting of the sand was only a minor issue at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court determined that the rule in question was a reasonable restriction on the political activities of county employees. The trial court denied the county employee's claimed entitlement to back wages that accrued during her unsuccessful candidacy and dismissed her constitutional claims with prejudice. The union contended that the employee had a property interest in her continued employment and held that the rule in question operated to deprive her of that right without due process of law. The court found that the county elected to confer a property right in continued employment upon non-probationary county employees. Whit it acted to place a senior employee on a mandatory leave of absence, that right was effected and could not have been so properly without due process of law. The court further determined that the administrative burden of providing a pre-suspension conflict hearing was minimal compared to the interest at stake and the risk of erroneous deprivation under the county's current rules. Accordingly, the county's rule was invalid and the county employee was entitled to back wages.</SPAN></P>

The officers received detailed factual information from a private citizen that defendant had been drinking and was &quot;throwing people around.&quot; They arrived at the home only minutes after the call, and no one responded to their knocking or yelling although the lights and television were on. The disordered state of the front room was consistent with the officers' information that a fight had occurred.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When a relatively new home caught fire and the general belief was that the fireplace was defective, the homeowner filed an action for negligent design and construction against the subcontractor who installed the fireplace.

The homeowners attempted to join the general contractor as a defendant but the trial court denied the motion as being barred by the two-year statute of limitations. A jury awarded damages against the subcontractor and the trial court determined that the general contractor would contribute 40 percent. The trial court also awarded prejudgment interest. The general contractor appealed, arguing that the contribution action was barred by the two-year statute of limitations and the subcontractor sought review of the assessment of prejudgment interest. The court held that: (1) the action for contribution was not barred because time did not start running until the subcontractor had been sued; and (2) the subcontractor was liable for prejudgment interest because its offer was not closer to the jury's award than the homeowner's counter offer.</SPAN></P>

After it received the kettles, the food company discovered that they were not properly tested as represented, and filed its action against the equipment company. The equipment company filed a motion to dismiss based on lack of personal jurisdiction, which was denied. On appeal, the court reversed. The court reviewed the quantity, nature, and quality of the contacts, the source and connection of the contacts to the action, Minnesota's interest in the action, and the convenience of the parties, and held that sufficient minimum contacts did not exist between the equipment company and Minnesota to justify asserting personal jurisdiction. The court emphasized that even if a state's interest was compelling, the primary focus must have been on the nonresident's interests and contacts with the forum state, not on the resident's interest in having the case decided in its home state.</SPAN></P>

The court held that (1) the Commissioner did not err by selecting a water level not advocated by either party because the water level recommended by the administrative law judge was supported by a preponderance of the evidence; (2) the Commissioner did not incorrectly apply &sect; 105.37, subd. 16 by considering evidence dating over a 150 year span because the 150 year span was a period within which reliable evidence of the ordinary high water level had been left in the area surrounding the water; and (3) the Commissioner's determination did not constitute a taking of private property because he merely determined which elevation constituted the highest water level which had been maintained for a sufficient period of time to leave evidence upon the landscape.</SPAN></P>

Appellant did not assert any dissenter's rights or accept payment of the conversion price for his shares under the merger plan. Appellant filed suit to set aside the merger and recover damages. The trial court granted respondent's motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. On appeal, the court affirmed. It held that the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, Minn.

On appeal, defendant contended that the admission of the out-of-court statements was error and that there was not sufficient evidence to support the conviction. In affirming the judgment, the court held that the hearsay statements to the medical doctor were properly admitted because sexual assault upon children did result in injuries requiring medical investigation and diagnosis. The court held that the admission of the statements pursuant to Minn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator nursing home sought review of a decision of the Department of Economic Security Court (Minnesota). The action challenged the constitutionality of a statute requiring its experience rating account to be charged in part for unemployment compensation benefits paid to respondent worker. Respondent commissioner of economic security had upheld the statute but declined to consider the constitutional challenge due to lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the court was whether the application of Minn. Stat. &sect; 268.06, subd. 5 (1984), requiring a nursing home's experience rating account to be charged for a portion of the worker's unemployment compensation benefits, violated the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution. The nursing home had argued that the statute impermissibly discriminated between employers who employed part-time workers on a weekly basis and those who employed part-time workers regularly but not weekly. The court held that to charge, or, in effect to specially assess, the nursing home's account for a portion of the worker's unemployment compensation benefits as a result of another employer's actions and due to no fault of the nursing home, while not imposing that same burden under similar circumstances on an employer who provided weekly, part-time employment, violated the constitutional mandate requiring that those who were similarly situated be treated alike. The court held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 268.06, subd. 5 (1984), as applied, violated the nursing home's right to equal protection under the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that &sect; 169.872, subd. 1 did not violate the due process clause of the state or federal constitutions. Appellant again sought the court's review. The court held that where first amendment freedoms were not involved, vagueness challenges had to be examined in light of the defendant's actual conduct. He had to show that the statute lacked specificity as to his own behavior and not as to a hypothetical situation. Here, appellant did not even try to comply with &sect; 169.872, subd. 1, and his violation of &sect; 169.872, subd. 1 appeared to be a result of business considerations, not an inability to understand it. Further, &sect; 169.872, subd. 1 adequately warned appellant that failure to attempt to record all the required information was a criminal offense.

The court found that the employee was fired when the manager told him &quot;you're through&quot; and that the firing was the result of discrimination based on the employee's marital status because he refused to marry his live-in girlfriend. The court concluded that the fact that the employee was required to live in a trailer near the manager's home as a condition of employment did not make him a domestic servant or alter the prohibition against discrimination in employment.

The court held that the Board's decision was not rendered invalid by its failure to include its findings and conclusions because the Board simply adopted the ALJ's findings and conclusions and was not required to restate them. The six-year revocation was not an abuse of discretion because the Board had suspended the chiropractor twice before and then found that he continued to engage in prohibited practices. The Board did not err in imposing costs under Minn. Stat. &sect; 148.10, subd. 3(c) (1984) because requiring payment for the services of the ALJ and a court reporter was not an abuse of discretion. Nor was Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by a city with operating an automobile racetrack without a license in violation of a city ordinance. The track attracted as many as 3,000 spectators, about 10 times the city's population. The ordinance required the obtainment of a license in order to operate or maintain a speedway, racetrack, or dragstrip. A fee was required to be paid in order to obtain a license. Defendant was charged after it refused to pay the license fee. Defendant's motion to dismiss the charge was denied. The trial court subsequently found defendant guilty of operating a racetrack without a license in violation of the city's ordinance. On appeal, the court determined that the trial courts did not err in denying the motion to dismiss and in ordering the entry of a judgment of conviction. The court found that the city's ordinance was a valid exercise of its police power. The court pointed out that there was evidence of several incidents per year requiring police protection from the city that were a direct result of the racetrack operation. Accordingly, the court found that the city could assess a portion of its police protection costs as part of a racetrack license.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. XII, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer instituted an action based on 1984 Minn. Laws ch. 502, art. 13, &sect; 15, which ordered the State to convey to the taxpayer 27 acres of land he forfeited for nonpayment of taxes. The trial court held that the legislation void and refused to compel the conveyance on the ground that the act was a special law remitting a forfeiture and granting an exclusive privilege to an individual in violation of Minn. Const. art. XII, &sect; 1. Five days later, the legislature retroactively repealed the act upon which the action was based. The court dismissed the appeal on the basis that the taxpayer's claim was moot because the legislature validly repealed the act upon which it was based. The court noted that the taxpayer improperly contended that the passage of the act gave him a contractual right to the property, and that the repealer was therefore an unconstitutional impairment of his contract right. The court further noted that there was nothing in the language or in the circumstances of the act's passage evincing a legislative intent to prohibit its later revision or repeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated actions, appellant juvenile offenders challenged the judgment of District Court of Hennepin County (Minnesota), which convicted them of truancy under Minn. Stat. &sect; 120.10 (1984). The issues included whether the admission of school attendance records violated the juveniles' right of confrontation and whether or not the absences were excused was an element to be proved by the State or an affirmative defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juveniles were convicted of being habitually truant, and they appealed. The juveniles argued that the admission of school attendance records as complete proof of truancy was legally insufficient and unconstitutional. The court held that first, truancy required a showing that someone, either a parent or child, was at &quot;fault&quot; for the non-attendance. The attendance records by themselves did not do that and were insufficient evidence. Second, the absence had to be &quot;without lawful excuse&quot; to be a truancy and again, by themselves the records, did not do that. Any &quot;legal conclusions&quot; as to whether the absences were excused or not, as noted by an attendance clerk or other school personnel, were not admissible under the business or official record exception to the hearsay rule and thus the juveniles' right to confrontation was violated. Finally, the trial court erred in holding that a showing that the absences were legally excused was an affirmative defense for the juveniles to prove. The State had to prove that the absences were not legally excused, which again the attendance records did not do on their own.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was 42 years old and was profoundly retarded; he did not speak and had epilepsy. He was aggressive towards staff and other residents and frequently injured himself. The patient, who was committed to a state hospital for an indeterminate time period as a mentally retarded person, required constant supervision, but could feed himself and wash his hands with prompting. His attorney filed motions challenging the constitutionality of indeterminate commitment, and sought a specific period for continued commitment or, in the alternative, for appointment of a guardian ad litem. The trial court denied the motions. The court affirmed and certified the case to the state supreme court. The court held that patients had a substantial liberty interest in not being confined unnecessarily, yet it determined that the numerous administrative and statutory safeguards already in effect protected mentally retarded patients from unnecessarily prolonged institutionalization. The court declined to address the constitutional equal protection contentions, because the issue was being reviewed by the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of criminal sexual conduct involving four children. Two of the children were found competent to testify and another was found not competent. The State did not call the youngest child. Hearsay statements from all four were introduced. Defendant contended that the trial court abused its discretion when it found the two children competent to testify without examining them on the substance of their trial testimony. The appellate court held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 595.02, subd. 1(f) (1984) contemplated only that the child be able to relate facts truthfully when examined and that a trial court should not elicit the anticipated testimony. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in admitting hearsay statements. As to the children who testified, the appellate court found the statements were properly admitted because their trial testimony was largely consistent with their earlier statements and defendant had an opportunity to cross-examine them. As to the children who did not testify, the court found the hearsay statements did not bear sufficient indicia of reliability. Since two counts relied on those statements, those convictions were reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vendor argued that the ordinance irreconcilably conflicted with Minn.

Affirming the conviction, the court held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 28A.065 authorized municipalities to enact privilege license requirements and that the ordinance thus did not conflict with the statute; that the ordinance was not preempted where the subject matter was not one requiring preemption and where the legislature had not clearly manifested preemptive intent. It held that the ordinance was not invalid merely because it used the term &quot;permit&quot; and applied only to food vendors; that the ordinance was not invalid for vagueness where it clearly stated that it was unlawful to conduct or operate a food establishment without obtaining a license; and that although the City did delegate some authority to the organization, the City was ultimately responsible for issuing the permits and thus there was no unlawful delegation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee contended that the claims processor injured him by continuing to adjust his benefits for inflation on October 1st of each year after the applicable statute was amended to provide for an annual adjustment on the anniversary date of his injury, which was September 4th. He cited a violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.82 (1984), which created a civil action for damages against any person who intentionally obstructed an employee seeking worker's compensation benefits. The circuit court dismissed the employee's action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, concluding that &sect; 176.82 did not apply to the employee's claim against the processor and that the employee's sole recourse was an administrative claim for penalties under Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.255 (1984). The court upheld the dismissal on the ground that the processor had a plausible interpretation of the amendment that did not amount to an intentional obstruction of the employee's claim under Minn.

The court stated that the &sect; 253B.18 had not impermissibly delegated legislative power to the review board without adequate safeguards. The court found that the decisions made by the board and the Commissioner were quasi-judicial and not legislative. The statutory scheme had adequately protected the due process rights of patients that had petitioned for discharge. The protections afforded to the individual in his petition for discharge included right to counsel and the presence of witnesses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issue was whether Minn.

The probate court found that although &sect; 256B.15 created a separate class of persons for different treatment based on age, the classification passed the rational basis test under the Equal Protection Clause. The court found that Minnesota legislature could have concluded that the State would receive recoupment of its medical assistance payments from recipients under 65 through alternative means, including tax withholdings when those recipients requiring medical assistance returned to full time employment. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment because the trial court properly allowed the claim made by the human services department, but certified the issue to the Minnesota Supreme Court based on the constitutional issue involved.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the ordinances were invalid without reaching the issue of whether they were void for vagueness. The court examined the Act and found that it prohibited local governments from setting standards of air quality that were more stringent than those set by the state pollution control agency. The court agreed with the trial court that the ordinances in issue conflicted with the Act because there was no quantifiable measurement set forth in the ordinances to determine whether their air quality standards were more stringent than the ambient air quality standards set forth in the Act. Because a person could be prosecuted under the ordinances for acts that were in compliance with the Act, the ordinances were invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed an order from the District Court, Hennepin County (Minnesota), which denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. He claimed that his mandatory life sentence under Minn. Stat. &sect; 244.05, subd. 4 deprived him of certain constitutional rights, including equal protection. The inmate was convicted of first degree murder in 1982 and was given a mandatory life sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Earlier statutes allowed inmates without a prior felony record convicted of first degree murder were eligible for supervised release after about 14 years imprisonment. Subsequent legislation abolished that sentencing and adopted determinate sentencing. Inmates convicted of first degree murder had to serve a minimum term of 17 years imprisonment prior to being eligible for supervised release. The inmate sought the lower supervised release date. He claimed that Minn. Stat. &sect; 244.05 was unconstitutional because it &quot;excluded&quot; first degree murder from the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines. That issue was never raised in the trial court. The court would not consider an issue on appeal, which was not raised at the trial court. However, first degree murder was not excluded from the sentencing guidelines law under Minn. Stat. &sect; 244.05, subd. 4. Those inmates were treated differently for sentencing because they had a mandatory life sentence under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.185 (1984), as opposed to a fixed sentence. Release authority for these inmates rested with the Commissioner of Corrections, subject to the mandatory minimum sentence imposed under Minn. Stat. &sect; 244.05, subd. 4.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, contending the prosecutor improperly referred to his criminal record, that the trial court improperly coerced a verdict denying him his right to a hung jury, that the trial court erred in its instructions, and that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's car was described to police after an attempted burglary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted under a city ordinance that required an owner of property that was zoned Rural Residential II to secure a special use permit for cattle. Defendant's appellate brief was not timely filed, but the court determined that dismissal of the appeal was an inappropriate sanction.

Defendant had actual notice of the ordinance and its provisions. The ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting photographs that showed cows on defendant's property as evidence. Further, defendant admitted that he had cattle, and he testified, with no objection from defense counsel, that a structure was on his property, and he used the structure to store hay and as a shelter for the cattle. Although the trial court erred in comments that it made to the jury, the error was harmless.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of conviction and the order of the District Court, Scott County (Minnesota) that denied his motion to dismiss the charges, and from an order denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea to two of twelve charged counts. Defendant, an high school assistant vice principal, was convicted of misconduct of a public employee, violating Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.43(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with misconduct of a public employee under Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 609.43(2), based on alleged sexual contact with students and former students, all of the age of consent. Defendant claimed that the acts alleged in the complaint did not come within the scope of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.43(2). The court agreed. Although defendant was a public employee, the mere fact that he was on duty at the time of some of the alleged acts did not alone transform the questioned act into acts done &quot;in his official capacity.&quot; Although the allegations against defendant were morally reprehensible and offensive, the State could not point to any criminal law specifically forbidding school teachers to have sexual contact with students of the age of consent. The court found nothing in Minnesota statutes or case law indicating a legislative intent to criminalize consensual sexual relations between persons of the age of consent merely because one of the participants happened to be a public employee. Therefore, the trial court erred in finding the State properly alleged criminal activity under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.43(2). The court did not address the claim that the plea bargain was violated.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that he could petition the West German guardianship court, pursuant to &sect; 1711 Nr. 4 BGB, to permit visitation with his daughter if would serve her welfare. Further, the court found that Minn. Stat. &sect; 518A.03 (1984) did not permit a Minnesota court to take jurisdiction over visitation rights of this non-resident child simply because the father was participating in a URESA proceeding.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the injured workers' claim was barred by Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.051 (1980), which imposed a two-year statute of limitations on actions brought in regard to improvements to real property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor designed, sold, and installed a dust collection system in the elevator. Four years after the explosion, the injured workers filed a motion to amend their complaint to include the contractor as additional defendant after an unidentified expert concluded that defects in the dust control systems caused excessive levels of dust, contributing in part to the explosion. The contractor filed a motion to dismiss, contending that &sect; 541.051 imposed a two-year statute of limitations. The trial court granted the motion. On appeal, the court held that because the statute was enacted before the explosion, but not effective until after the explosion, did not evince a clear intent toward retroactive applicability. Therefore, the trial court erred by dismissing the injured workers' action against the contractor. Further, the court held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 645.21 (1984), requiring such clear intent did not differentiate between procedural and substantive statutes and, therefore, &sect; 541.051 did not apply retroactively. The court finally held that the six-year statute of limitations applied, reversing the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. Specifically, the court held that the Council's decision was not arbitrary and capricious where the corporation's owner had improperly failed to withhold federal and state income taxes for employees, the corporation's employees had previously allowed the open use of marijuana at a certain bar, and the owner had failed to disclose contingent liabilities and pending litigation in which he and the corporation were defendants.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient, who was also blind, was committed as a mentally retarded person to the hospital, where he required 24-hour supervision and was awaiting community placement. After his initial six-month commitment, treatment reports were filed. Based on those reports, the district court found that the patient continued to be mentally retarded, that he required involuntary commitment for his own protection, and that he was unable to care for himself. The patient argued that Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.13, subd. 2, which provided for indeterminate commitment of mentally retarded patients without annual court review was discriminatory because under Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.13, subds. 1, 3, mentally ill and chemically dependant persons could not be committed for more than one year without the filing of a new petition for commitment. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 253B.13, subd. 2, was constitutional. Because mentally ill and chemically dependant patients recovered with treatment, and mentally retarded patients, whose conditions were permanent, did not, there was a rational basis for the disparate treatment which was related to the state's legitimate interest in caring for mentally retarded patients.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the trial court must have allowed defendant to stipulate to the prior revocation of his driver's license unless the prejudicial effect of that evidence was outweighed by its probative value to some disputed issue and that the trial court's error was not harmless because there was reasonable doubt that the erroneously admitted evidence contributed to the verdict. Because proof of a violation of aggravated violations under Minn.

The club appealed, contending, among other things, that the imposition of sanctions under the Minneapolis ordinance was unconstitutional because it infringed on the free exercise of a religious commitment. On appeal, the court affirmed the commission's order with a modification of the compensatory award. The court held that the evidence supported the commission's findings. The court further held that the health club had no standing to assert free-exercise rights as matters of defense because the club had no institutional free-exercise rights or derivative free-exercise rights.

The trustee had sued the homeowners after her elderly decedent died after falling down the stairs in the homeowner's residence, in which he lived.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent had lived with the homeowners for seven years at the time he fell down the stairs in the middle of the night. His trustee sued for negligence after the decedent died as a result of his injuries, but the jury returned a defense verdict, from which the trustee appealed. The court affirmed. It found no error by the district court in its refusal to incorporate the language of Minn. Stat. &sect; 504.18 (1982) into the jury charge because that statute did not impose a new standard of care on the homeowners in their alleged role as &quot;landlords&quot; to the decedent. The court also ruled that the district court correctly refused to instruct the jury that there was a common law presumption that the decedent was exercising due care because such a presumption only operated, if at all, when there was no evidence of negligence on the part of the decedent and the court found that in fact there was evidence in the record that suggested that decedent had been negligent. The court approved of the district court's handling of testimonial issues including the proposed impeachment of one of the homeowners, and agreed that the trustee was not entitled to a new trial or a judgment n.o.v.</SPAN></P>

The Public Employees Labor Relation Act, Minn. Stat. &sect; 179.61-.76 (1982), was amended to expand the definition of permanent employee. The board found that the statute did not affect an existing contract. The union disagreed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A county hired a part-time, temporary employee to work for 100 days under an existing labor agreement. The employee had worked for less than 67 days when the legislature amended the Public Employees Labor Relation Act, Minn. Stat. &sect; 179.61- .76 (1982), to make an employee permanent after the 68th day of employment. The employee worked for 93 days, and the union claimed the position as part of its bargaining unit. Under the contract that existed at the time the employee was hired, an employee did not become permanent until after 100 days. The court held that although the Commerce Clause of both the federal and state constitutions restricted the government from interfering with an existing contract, the instant action fell within well-defined exceptions to the restriction. The court found that after the statute became effective, the county had the option of firing the employee before her 68th day of employment. There was no substantial impairment of the contract relationship. There was no unconstitutional impairment to the collective bargaining agreement.</SPAN></P>

In answers to interrogatories, the jury found the city liable to the owner for emotional distress for damages totaling $ 30,000. When the trial court ruled for the city, the owner appealed. Reversing as to the inverse condemnation claim, the court said that there had been a taking, without a decision on the useful life of the improvement, and that the trial court erred as a matter of law in refusing the owner an award of damages. Affirming for the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, the court said that the owner did not present facts rising to that tort. The facts were not the extreme and outrageous facts that constituted that tort. The owner had claimed a cause of action under federal law as an alternative to his claim of a taking under state law.

The court held that the three indictments were valid because they could have been based on evidence heard at the grand jury hearing. The court also held that the trial court did not err in consolidating the three indictments because all three related to defendant's illegal use of authority or her disorderly conduct. The court concluded that defendant's overbreadth challenge was unavailing because she had failed to show that &sect; 609.43(2) could be applied to constitutionally protected conduct. The court also concluded that defendant's vagueness challenge failed because &sect; 609.43(2) conveyed a sufficient warning as to the proscribed conduct. Finally, the court held that viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the jury could have reasonably found that defendant knowingly committed an act in excess of her authority or knowingly committed an illegal act.

On appeal, the trustee contended that the grant of immunity to the City under Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.03, subd. 2 (1984) violated the equal protection guarantees of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Minn.

The Commissioner applied the more specific provision of the economic security statute,&nbsp;Minn.

The court reversed, holding that, interpreting the provisions of &sect; 268.08, subd. 3(2) consistent with the whole of the economic security act, the employees were ineligible to receive unemployment compensation for the period of time during lay-off in which they received vacation pay. Minn. Stat. &sect; 645.26 required that general and specific provisions of law be construed to give effect to both.

After perfecting his interest in the land, the developer discovered that he could not build a dwelling on the land without three variances. The developer applied to the city for the requisite variances, but the city denied the application. The trial court declared that the denial was not arbitrary or unreasonable, a deprivation of equal protection, or a deprivation of the use and enjoyment of the land without compensation. On appeal, the developer contended that the denial of the variances constituted an undue hardship and an unconstitutional taking of the land. Upon review, the court affirmed, holding that the city had legally sufficient reasons and a factual basis for denying the developer's request for variances and that the city's action was not unreasonable, capricious, or beyond its legal powers.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 609.02, subd. 6 (1982) was unconstitutional because it was vague and diluted the State's burden of proof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly struck a victim on the face, legs, and arms with a four-foot metal floor lamp having a large metal base. After the trial court found that the victim suffered no substantial harm, it dismissed the charge brought against defendant and held that &sect; 609.02, subd. 6, was unconstitutionally vague and diluted the State's burden of proof. The court reversed, holding that the trial court erred when it found that the lamp could not be a dangerous weapon unless it caused great or substantial bodily harm. The argument was contrary to the valid legislative intent supporting the specific statutory definitions of a dangerous weapon and second-degree assault. The assaultive conduct while using an object capable of inflicting great bodily harm was proscribed regardless of whether bodily harm was actually incurred. If the trial court determined that the State's burden of proof was diluted, the remedy was to give a jury an instruction that informed it of the substance of the statute without using the confusing language.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer found a sum of money outside a home when responding to a burglary call.

Stat. &sect; 423.73(c) (1982). On review, the court held that, by accepting and retaining employment as a police officer with the city, the officer was contractually obligated to follow the rules in the Manual. When read together, the Manual and Minn. Stat. &sect; 423.73(c) (1982) indicated that a city police officer was contractually barred through his employment contract with the city from asserting a claim to money he allegedly found during the course of his official duties. Further, pursuant to &sect; 473.73(c), the officer, through his contractual obligations to the MPRA, waived any common law right to the money in favor of the MPRA. There also were strong public policy considerations against allowing an officer to assert title to unclaimed money or other property found by him during the course and scope of his employment.</SPAN></P>

When the telephone company petitioned the Commission for a general rate increase, the citizen's group and the citizen intervened opposing the proposed rate increase.

It recommended that the telephone company be required to provide low cost or free telecommunications devices for the deaf (TDD). The Commission found that the citizens group had the burden of proving its proposals were reasonable and that its proposals were not supported by evidence in the record. Specifically, the Commission found it could not determine whether the proposals were feasible or cost prohibitive. The trial court affirmed the Commission's action. The trial court determined that the citizen was accorded his full procedural rights in the proceeding. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. The citizens group had the burden of proof, in accordance with Minn. R. Civ. P. 1400.7300, subpt. 5, to show that its proposals were reasonable.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 573.02 (1976).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Wrongful Death Act, &sect; 573.02 provided a three-year statute of limitations. Six years was allowed within which to bring a personal injury action. The limitation period in &sect; 573.02 was contended to be an unconstitutional denial of equal protection. Section 573.02 in effect at the date of the victim's death in 1976 was controlling. Determination of a reasonable amount of time to commence an action was generally a matter for the legislature, and three years was not so short a limitation period as to work a denial of justice. The three-year period was a claimed denial of equal protection because personal injury claimants were allowed six years and wrongful death claimants were &quot;similarly situated&quot; to personal injury claimants. The personal injury claim included compensation for pain and suffering. The wrongful death claim was to compensate decedent's dependents for the economic harm they suffered. The recoveries were meant to compensate for two different losses. Also, the two classes of claimants were not similarly situated; therefore the different limitations periods did not provide dissimilar treatment to similarly situated persons and were not a denial of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The case proceeded to trial, and a jury found her guilty. She moved for a new trial, alleging evidentiary error and error in refusing to give a requested jury instruction. The trial court denied the motion, and she appealed. The court held that prostitution was not protected under privacy for commercial speech provisions of the state or federal constitutions. The court reversed the conviction because the trial court erred in refusing to give an entrapment instruction, which is a defense to prostitution, and in refusing to admit for the purposes of impeachment the arresting officer's prior inconsistent statements. The court determined that the trial court did not err in refusing to admit expert testimony on the ineffectiveness of withdrawal as a method of birth control because it would have been confusing to the jury or in admitting evidence of defendant's ownership and control of a health club because it relevant for those purposes.</SPAN></P>

In the alternative, defendant contended that it was entitled to reallocation or common law contribution from the settling defendants. The court determined that the releases that were executed by plaintiff and the settling defendants did not eliminate joint liability. The indemnification provisions of the releases merely shifted the financial responsibility for the settling defendants to plaintiff so that he stood in the shoes of the settling defendants with respect to defendant's contribution claims. The court concluded that defendant was entitled to contribution from plaintiff for the amount of the bankrupt defendant's portion of the award because plaintiff accepted the risks associated with his piecemeal litigation when he settled with some defendants and continued to trial against others.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 252A.13, subd. 4 (1982). Petitioners contended the statute as applied violated her right to due process and equal protection of the law by invading her fundamental right to privacy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 252A.13, subd. 4 (1982), empowered respondent State to consent to a ward's sterilization and included a judicial procedure for determining whether the sterilization was in the best interest of the ward. Petitioners argued that &sect; 252A.13, subd. 4 denied the woman due process of law. The State argued that the woman was very affectionate, was vulnerable to being seduced, and was not supervised 24-hours a day. The woman had been taking oral contraceptives but had stopped; she stated that she did not have sexual intercourse and did not intend to in the future and that she believed she should have the operation because everyone said she should. The court stated that the statute did not provide a burden of proof and held that the State was constitutionally required to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the procedure was in her best interest, which it had not done. The governmental imposition of a surgical procedure that terminated the capacity to have children was a substantial intrusion in the area of a fundamental right. The court held that the best interest standard required, at minimum, a showing that the woman was likely to engage in intercourse.</SPAN></P>

R. 9510.0470, subpt. 4.B. permitted only nursing homes with 65 percent welfare patient days to obtain a waiver, and that the Commissioner had no jurisdiction to determine if a rule was arbitrary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nursing home contended that because it experienced a material decrease in occupancy, a per diem method rather than the gross dollar method used by the Department of Human Services (DHS) should have been employed in calculating Medicaid paybacks. The court affirmed the order, finding that the practice of using the per diem method constituted an impermissible interpretation of Minn. R. 9510.0030, subpt. 3.J. Calculations made using the per diem method could not be enforced because the per diem method was a rule that had not been promulgated in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. The nursing home contended that the failure of DHS to promulgate a new rule for nursing homes constituted a breach of its statutory duty under Minn. Stat. &sect; 256B.04, subd. 2 (1982) because the payback rule was unreasonable as applied. The court rejected the contention, finding that the nursing home cited no authority granting an administrative law judge the authority to consider the issue. Finally, the court determined that the rule prohibiting the use of the per diem method was not unreasonably applied because the rule was rationally related to the end sought to be achieved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the complainant, who was shopping with her infant child, bent over to look at merchandise on a lower shelf, she felt one or two hands rub up her upper thigh and over each side of her buttocks. She described the touch as a &quot;deliberate grab.&quot; The complainant stood up, turned around, and saw defendant very near her in the aisle. As defendant walked down the aisle, the complainant followed him until he entered another aisle and looked at her &quot;with a smirk on his face.&quot; The store manager later indicated to police that he had earlier observed defendant in the store following two women shoppers, staring at their buttocks. The court found that defendant did not raise an overbreadth challenge to Minn. Stat. &sect; 617.23 (1984) because he did not identify any conduct protected under the First Amendment which the statute purported to regulate. The court held that &sect; 617.23 was not unconstitutionally vague because defendant could have had no reasonable doubt that his actions in fondling a woman's thigh and buttocks were &quot;open or gross lewdness or lascivious behavior&quot; or a &quot;public indecency.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The motorist argued the trial court erred in finding the city immune under Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.03, subd. 2 (1982) since the statute violated equal protection under Minn. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist was injured after her car collided with a bent metal sign post in the median of the street. The motorist was privately employed and was acting in the scope of her employment at the time of the accident. The motorist received workers' compensation benefits for medical expenses and temporary total and permanent partial disabilities. The motorist sued the city and alleged negligence in the design and maintenance of the street. The trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment based on Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.03, subd. 2 (1982), which created a statutory exception to the abolishment of municipal immunity in cases where the injured party was covered by worker's compensation laws. The motorist appealed and contended that the statute violated the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 by distinguishing between tort claims against the state and tort claims against municipalities, and by distinguishing between victims of municipal torts who were eligible for workers' compensation and those who were not.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent town board and appellant, board member with an interest in the action, sought review of a judgment of the District Court for Olmstead County (Minnesota) that issued a mandamus order requiring the board to reconsider respondent bar's application to renew its liquor license without the board member's participation and denied a summary judgment motion to dismiss the bar's action to renew its license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bar argued that Minn. Stat. &sect; 340.14, subd. 3(7) (1982), which provided that no intoxicating liquor license could be issued to a location within 1500 feet of a public school location outside a municipality did not apply because the entire area was a municipality as defined by Minn. Stat. &sect; 340.07, subd. 11. The bar further argued that its right to a license was not affected by the statutory 1500 foot statutory prohibition because its license was in effect before enactment of the statutory prohibition. The bar also argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and amounted to a denial of equal protection. The court rejected the bar's arguments. The court found that the statute was sufficiently clear and that it did not violate the bar's equal protection rights. The court also found that a denial of the liquor establishment's license would not be an unconstitutional confiscation of a vested property interest. However, the court found that the trial court had made no findings as to whether the school was a public school within the meaning of the statute and whether it was within any municipality so as to make the statute applicable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the case to the trial court with directions to deny the bar's license renewal if it found that the school was a public school within the meaning of the statute and it was located outside a municipality. If the trial court found it was not a school or was within a municipality so that the statute was not applicable then the trial court was to determine if the board's decision to deny the license was arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the order, finding that &sect; 571.41 was replete with procedural safeguards that protected the rights of both parties and did not deny any due process of law. The individual debtor represented himself as a partner in the business debtor, which estopped either from denying that the individual debtor was a partner in the business debtor.

The state did not introduce a certified copy of the California conviction. However, Minn. R. Evid. 1005 permitted the use of oral testimony as evidence of the contents of official records. A probation officer testified that he established defendant's 1975 arrest for forgery from a federal presentence investigation. He testified that the Los Angeles Probation Department's card file indicated defendant had pled guilty to possession of a forged check and received three years probation, a felony sentence. Such testimony was sufficient to establish the California conviction. The court found there was evidence that defendant's federal sentence for an unrelated crime had been extended. Thus, the trial court properly assigned him a custody status point. The trial court did not err in allowing the prosecution to argue against a stay of execution. The stay of execution was not a part of the plea agreement in this case. Further, defendant did not reasonably understand the state sentence would run concurrently with any federal sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant spent the day drinking and driving at high speeds, ultimately engaging in a high speed chase that resulted in the death of another driver. On appeal, defendant argued that his actions could not be found as evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life, under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.195 (1982). The court reviewed the record and held that the jury's verdict was based upon sufficient evidence. The court also found that defendant failed to preserve the alleged error regarding the giving of an improper jury instruction, and there was no evidence of plain error affecting substantial rights or error in fundamental law in the jury instructions. Further, defendant's contention that Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.205 (1982) was unconstitutional was meritless. The trial court had the discretion to exclude expert testimony concerning post-traumatic stress syndrome, and the admission of expert testimony concerning the speeds of the vehicles at the time of impact was within the broad discretion of the trial court under Minn.

The court held that Minnesota did not recognize conditional pleas and that the effect of defendant's plea was to preclude a record upon which the court could decide the constitutional issues.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under &sect; 256B.48 subd. 1(a), the nursing home was not eligible to receive medical assistance (MA) payments unless it charged an equal rate to private and MA patients. The nursing home asked the DPW's approval for creation of two separate nursing homes within its building, by removing part of its unit from the MA program and seeking MA certification only for the other unit. The DPW rejected the nursing home's proposal and determined that certifying only part of the facility did not negate the effect of the law. The court affirmed the trial court's decision affirming the DPW's decision. The court held that &sect; 256B.48 subd. 1(a) had to be applied to a nursing home in its entirety. The equalization law's purpose was to reduce discrimination against MA recipients, alleviate the stigma attached to receiving MA benefits, promote fairness, and ease the resentment of private pay patients directed toward MA recipients. If the nursing home was allowed to charge private pay patients more, there was an increased likelihood that the private pay patients would receive better services.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother was in prison with four years left to serve for murdering her infant daughter, who died of massive head injuries and showed evidence of other beatings. The mother had three other children, but only her four-year-old was the subject of the proceeding to terminate her parental rights. The foster parents testified that the child's generally loving behavior would change significantly for the worse after a visit with his mother in prison. Additionally, the child was developmentally delayed, but had made some progress in his two years in foster care. Experts claimed that the mother was psychologically disturbed. The court held that, based on such evidence, the trial court correctly determined that the mother was palpably unfit to be party to the parent and child relationship. Minn. Stat. &sect; 260.221(b)(4) was not void for vagueness. Based on the setbacks the child experienced after visits with his mother in prison, her incarceration was a condition that rendered her palpably unfit. Most important, however, to her characterization as palpably unfit were her conviction that she was indeed a good parent and her unwillingness to view proposed therapy as necessary or helpful.</SPAN></P>

The petition alleged that the mother had left her two-year-old child with the child's maternal grandmother, and that she had provided the grandmother with no information concerning her future plans or when she would return to pick up her child. A social worker testified that the mother had not met the conditions of her rehabilitation plan. The mother testified at another hearing that she had a conflict with authority, didn't feel she should have to prove her love for her child, and didn't think there was anything wrong in the beginning. The court held that the evidence and findings of fact supported the trial court's termination of the mother's parental rights. The mother's visitation of her child was infrequent, and her inability to properly care for her child would continue in the future. The mother was not likely to change her behavior in the foreseeable future. The adversarial nature of the termination proceedings was not statutorily authorized.

The trial court denied the chiropractor's summary judgment motion, concluding that the patient's cause was subject to the six-year statute of limitations under Minn.

The court held that the term &quot;physicians&quot; in Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.07 (1980) did not include chiropractors. Chiropractic malpractice was, therefore, subject to a six-year limitation period for causes of action accruing prior to March 23, 1982. Because the patient's cause of action arose prior to that date, it was governed by the six-year period under Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.05 (1980).</SPAN></P>

On the basis of that information, the detective obtained a warrant to search defendant's apartment. From seized photographs, several other abused boys were identified. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized from his apartment. The court found no error in the denial of the motion to suppress, concluding that the information, although two years old, was not too stale to establish probable cause for the search. The court observed that a person engaged in ongoing criminal sexual conduct might reasonably be expected to keep pornographic pictures and magazines for several years. Moreover, there was evidence of a continuous course of conduct by defendant in abusing boys. Although the complaint did not state the exact dates on which the abuse occurred, the court found it sufficient.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the dismissal of the action for lack of personal jurisdiction. The manufacturer did not have sufficient minimum contacts with Minnesota to permit constitutional exercise of personal jurisdiction. Although telephone and mail negotiations and discussions occurred between the parties, the manufacturer's only real contact with the state was the sale and delivery of the trailers. Further, the nature and quality of the contacts were in sufficient to support jurisdiction, as the manufacturer never advertised or solicited business in Minnesota. Further, the buyer initiated both the initial contact in Florida and the change of delivery terms to Minnesota. The small number of contacts and relatively isolated nature of the transaction rendered jurisdiction over the manufacturer unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 525.145(3) (1982).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent received medical assistance benefits from the county from an illness in 1979 until her death on April 1, 1983. On appeal, the personal representative contended that the effective date of the amendment of Minn. Stat. &sect; 525.145(3) (1982) that eliminated the homestead exemption was August 1, 1982 and that allowing the county's total claim constituted an impermissible retroactive application of the statute. On review, the court held that the trial court properly applied &sect; 525.145(3) in granting the county's claim for the value of medical assistance benefits to be assessed in full against the decedent's homestead because at the time of the decedent's death, &sect; 525.145(3), as amended by 1982 Minn. Laws ch. 621, &sect; 3(3) and 1982 Minn. Laws ch. 641, &sect; 21 was in effect. The statute as amended increased the pool of assets from which medical assistance benefits could be recovered to include the homestead from and after April 1, 1982. There was nothing retroactive either in the claim or in the availability of the homestead asset. Further, when the homestead exemption was eliminated, no vested right of the decedent's heirs was impaired because they had only an expectancy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department of public welfare had issued a final order that disallowed certain costs for the care of the nursing homes' medical assistance patients for the years 1975 through 1980. The four nursing homes then filed a writ of certiorari that sought a review of the DPW's final order. The nursing homes contended that by not allowing the costs and offsets for &quot;efficiencies&quot;, the rates that could be charged by the nursing homes were adversely affected. They also contend that their due process rights were violated and that DPW had applied an unpromulgated rule when it required a nursing home to meet a burden of proof. The court rejected these arguments. The court reasoned that when there was an ambiguity in the unpromulgated rules of the DPW, the court could properly defer to the DPW's interpretation of those rules. Further, the court noted that substantial evidence had supported the DPW's findings with regards to the disallowance of the costs at issue. The court affirmed the DPW's final order that disallowed the costs at issue. However, the court made one modification by allowing the nursing homes a 15 percent known cost increase.</SPAN></P>

Further, defendant's claim that the State destroyed possibly exculpatory evidence when it failed to save his breathalyzer test and the reference ampoules had no merit. The court held that the test ampoule itself was immaterial because the ampoule could not be retested. Further, defendant made no showing that there was any apparent exculpatory value in the reference ampoule. The court pointed out that other avenues were available to obtain comparable evidence. Defendant could have obtained an independent test, or could have cross-examined the officer about the condition of the reference ampoule.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Colorado corporation provided medical care in Colorado.

Thereafter, the Colorado corporation engaged a physician. Plaintiff sued defendants to collect the recruiting fee. Plaintiff served process on defendants in Colorado. The Colorado corporation's motion to dismiss the claim for lack of personal jurisdiction was denied. On appeal, the issue was whether the Colorado corporation's conduct provided sufficient minimum contacts with Minnesota to permit Minnesota's exercise of personal jurisdiction over it. The court found the Colorado corporation's contacts with Minnesota were not significant enough to provide &quot;minimum contacts.&quot; Therefore, service of process on the Colorado corporation under Minnesota's long arm statute was an unconstitutional extension of the state's personal jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An inmate complained that his punishment was cruel and unusual in violation of his rights under U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The inmate believed the guards failed to enforce rules against assault and disorderly conduct. He recited four incidents of slapping, grabbing, pushing, and threatening, all allegedly seen and ignored by guards, but all upon inmates other than himself. Consequently, the complaints were unrelated to the inmate's conditions of confinement and they were not a basis for his requested relief. The heart of the inmate's petition dealt with an accusation that he was subjected to stress, humiliation, and degradation after he protested when other prisoners spat on the floors in the dining room and in the cellblocks. His protests inspired a threat or threats by others, prompting prison officials to place the inmate in a protective custody unit. The court held that this complaint failed to support a claim that defendant was hurt or degraded. The petition failed to make a prima facie showing of cruel or unusual conditions of confinement.

On review, the court reversed the trial court's judgment of conviction. In reaching its decision, the court held that the trial court committed reversible error by including the unconstitutional statutory language of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.341(11) (1980) in the jury instructions. The court next considered the trial court's exclusion of defendant and his counsel from the trial court's competency examination of two child witnesses. The court held that it was permissible for the trial court to exclude defendant from such an examination, but that it was impermissible for the trial court to exclude defendant's counsel unless the trial court found that defense counsel's presence was likely to intimate the child witnesses or interfere with their ability to freely communicate. The court remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was convicted in state court for aggravated assault. He was convicted at the same time on a federal charge of possessing an explosive device. A federal district court sentenced him to imprisonment for a term of 10 years. The Minnesota court sentenced him to a prison term of three to 10 years. The Minnesota sentence was ordered to be concurrent with federal imprisonment. Two years later, a detainer was filed on the Warrant of Commitment issued by the state court. The prisoner was scheduled for release from his Minnesota sentence on April 10, 1987. He was to be released from the federal prison on December 14, 1985. The district court denied the habeas corpus petition. On appeal, the court found that the Minnesota sentence was in the form of a commitment to the Minnesota Commissioner of Corrections. The sentencing judge did not limit the effects of the Minnesota sentence. The prisoner's expectation on sentencings was not &quot;legitimate&quot; and could not interfere with his lawful sentence. The actions of Minnesota officials did not constitute a waiver of their rights for his custody. Upon release by federal authorities, the prisoner had to be imprisoned in Minnesota.</SPAN></P>

Upon respondent's motion, a writ of attachment was issued and property attached. Summary judgment was entered in favor of respondent. Appellant's motion to vacate the writ was denied. No appeal was taken, and appellant later filed a second motion to vacate, which the District Court, Marshall County (Minnesota) denied. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The second motion to vacate the writ of attachment was brought after the right to appeal from the denial of appellant's first motion to vacate the writ of attachment had expired. Appellant argued in the second motion that the writ was issued pursuant to a statute that had been declared unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment denying the motion. Where the right to appeal from an un-vacated appealable order had expired, the right of appeal was not revived by a negative order on a second motion for the same relief. However, a party might appeal from a second motion upon grounds not asserted in the first motion. Because appellant argued that the statute had been declared unconstitutional, it was appealable. The attachment statute under which the writ had issued, Minn. Stat. &sect; 570.02 (1980), was amended and that amendment, Minn. Stat. &sect; 570.02, subd. 2(b)(2)(ii) (1981), was declared unconstitutional because it was overbroad. However, appellant's contention that this declaration also declared Minn.

The insurer paid the passenger's medical and wage-loss benefits, but refused to pay uninsured motorists benefits. In granting summary judgment in favor of the insurer, the trial court held that &sect; 65B.63 only required payment of economic loss benefits. The passenger argued that assigned claims plan requires an assignee to pay all benefits. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment, holding that claimant under the assigned claims plan were not really &quot;insureds.&quot; The court held that the legislature, having determined as a matter of social policy that certain minimum benefits should be available to all accident victims, was not obligated to extend the coverage it chose to provide uninsured victims to include all the benefits for which insureds were required to pay.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the parents' eight children were neglected under Minn. Stat. &sect; 260.015, subd. 10(b), (e) (1982). The trial court transferred legal custody of three children to the county welfare board and placed the other five children in their parents' home under protective supervision.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ultimately determined that all eight children were neglected. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The record supported the finding that four children had been neglected, including the adoptive daughters. As the parents conceded, the evidence was sufficient to show that the father failed to provide parental care. The record was also sufficient to support that finding with respect to the mother. The record showed that the mother played an active role in one incident, that she was aware of and approved another incident, and that she ignored a third incident. The neglected children's welfare could not be guaranteed by the mother in light of her passive acceptance of her husband's conduct. However, the record did not support the trial court's finding that the remaining children were neglected and in particular that the boys were without proper parental care or otherwise neglected. The boys were not neglected simply because the father was a harsh disciplinarian.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the utility continued to charge three of its large-volume customers' rates deemed by the Commission to be discriminatory during the entire 13-month rate proceeding. The court opined that in doing so, the utility deliberately circumvented the Commission's order and delayed implementing a uniform rate as long as possible. Under such circumstances, the court found that the authority to order the refund was by fair implication and intendment incident to and included in the authority expressly conferred for the purpose of carrying out and accomplishing the objects for which the Commission was created as contained in &sect; 216B.16.

(3) Is the statute unconstitutional in effect and application to a defendant who is less at fault than the deceased victim? (4) Is being less at fault than the deceased victim a defense under the statute?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While traveling along a highway, defendant crossed the centerline, striking and killing decedent, who had been lying unconscious on the roadway. Blood alcohol tests revealed that both defendant and the victim were intoxicated, with defendant having a blood alcohol concentration of .11 percent and the victim having a blood alcohol concentration of at least .24 percent. Defendant was charged with criminal vehicular operation in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.21, subd. 1 (1983). Defendant moved to dismiss, contending that the statute was vague and overbroad. After the trial court denied defendant's motion, it certified four questions for consideration. On review, the court concluded that the statute was not impermissibly vague; use of the term &quot;negligent&quot; gave fair notice of the type of conduct prohibited. Further, defendant's overbreadth claim failed because she pointed to no constitutionally protected activity that the statute impinged upon. Defendant's equal protection claim likewise failed because the statute's singling out of drunk drivers was reasonably and rationally related to the purposes of the law. Lastly, the fault of the victim was not a defense under the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board sought access to the landowners' property to conduct electrical resistivity tests to obtain soil permeability information. The Board planned to use the information to conduct an environmental impact study. The landowners denied repeated requests for access, and the Board brought an action.

Further, the court found that electrical resistivity testing, like surveying, involved only a temporary intrusion which did not substantially interfere with property rights or cause a measurable decline in market value. Therefore, it did not rise to the level of a constitutional taking. The Board did not impermissibly delegate the determination of necessity to its staff. The record established that the Board, acting upon staff recommendations, deemed electrical resistivity testing at the site to be necessary, and reliance upon staff recommendations did not constitute illegal rulemaking.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and driving with an alcohol concentration of .10 or more. The complaint charged each count as a gross misdemeanor because of a prior misdemeanor conviction. Defendant served written notice of a motion to dismiss on the basis that the prior conviction was an uncounseled guilty plea that could not be used for enhancement purposes because it violated her Sixth Amendment rights. The district court dismissed, holding that defendant's prior conviction could not be used as a basis to charge the counts as gross misdemeanors because the State did not adequately meet its required showing that her prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction was obtained in a manner consistent with constitutional requirements. The State appealed, and the court affirmed. The court found that there was no record of defendant's guilty plea and conviction, that neither the form nor the procedure used to relate to defendant her rights to counsel before pleading guilty were sufficient, and that defendant had properly challenged the constitutional validity of the misdemeanor as a basis for the gross misdemeanor charge under Minn. R. Crim. P. 10.04.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During his divorce, a husband claimed that he had no partnership assets. After the divorce, he sued his partner to recover them. The wife then filed a successful action in the district court to attach the husband's share of the partnership assets. The husband filed a motion to vacate the attachment order on the ground that it did not meet the statute's requirements. The district court denied the motion. The state supreme court then held that the attachment statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 570.02(2)(b)(2)(ii) (1982), was unconstitutional. The husband's second motion to vacate was denied. On appeal, the court first explained that the husband could bring the appeal, although the 30-day period had expired, because it contained new grounds. The court then examined the attachment statute. The new principle of law created by the supreme court's decision was deemed to have retroactive application, because it would be inequitable to allow unconstitutional attachments to continue. However, Minn. Stat. &sect; 570.02(4) (1980), the act that had preceded the invalid statute, was constitutional. The writ of attachment in this case met the requirements of &sect; 570.02(4) and was upheld. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed action contesting the valuation of its contaminated property. The parties filed cross-motions for partial summary judgment regarding whether property market value, without contamination, could be reduced by the stigma of the property, which was the loss in value due to the lack of marketability and mortgageability occasioned by the contamination. Petitioner argued stigma was not subject to contamination tax provisions, Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 270.91-98, and that stigma and costs to cure the property were separate. The court held stigma was not covered by the contamination tax provisions based on the plain meaning of the statute. Thus, stigma could reduce the unimpaired value of the property (the value of the property without contamination). Any value reduction amount for stigma was not subject to the contamination tax. Stigma was separate and distinct from contamination and clean up costs.</SPAN></P>

The court stood by its order to allow the law firm to file a brief amicus curiae, finding that it would be helpful to hear all possible arguments on the issue.

When the taxpayer failed to do so, the Commissioner began collection efforts against his former wife, who in turn notified the Commissioner of the marriage dissolution and sought to reduce her liability to a portion of the tax. The Commissioner reviewed income and deduction figures submitted by both parties, allocated a portion of the unpaid tax to each party based upon that review and issued divorced spouse determination orders. On appeal, the taxpayer asserted that the orders impaired his right to contract in violation of Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The court held that there could not be an impairment of a party's right to contract if no contract existed. The taxpayer also asserted that the Commissioner did not properly allocate monies spent by the parties on dependent care during the years at issue. The court affirmed the orders of the Commissioner because it found that the dependent care expenses were not included in the parties' joint income and were properly excluded from the reallocation calculations.</SPAN></P>

The corporation alleged that it was entitled to the exemption because it was an institution of purely public charity. The county denied the application and classified the property as an apartment complex and sent property tax statements for taxes payable in 1996. The court held that the corporation was not an institution of purely public charity within the meaning of Minn. Const. art. X, &sect; 1. The court found that the majority of the corporation's considerable revenues were derived from rent charged to the residents and such revenues were not supported in whole or in part by donations. Also, the records showed that the revenues generated from the residents' rents nearly covered debt service, amortization and depreciation. As such, the corporation more closely resembled a commercial enterprise than a charity.

The taxpayers claimed that the tax discriminated against members of the same class in violation of Minn. Const. art. X, &sect; 1, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court found that the contamination tax created four new classes of property but did not treat members of the same class unequally. The taxpayers also asserted that the contamination tax was a confiscatory tax which violated Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, and U.S. Const. amend. V. The court disagreed, holding that the contamination tax was rationally related to a public purpose and was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious.

The taxpayer argued that there was no connection between Minnesota and the new company's gain, and if a connection was found, the income attributed to Minnesota was unfairly apportioned.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company bought what it contended was capital equipment prior to the enactment of the 1993 Amendment. By the time the company paid its taxes and sought a refund under the 1990 version, the effective date for the 1993 Amendment had gone into effect. Because the 1993 Amendment changed the definition of capital equipment, the commissioner denied the company' refund. The court held that it was a violation of due process to apply the 1993 Amendment. The court found although a statute of limitations could be altered without violating the guarantee of due process, a &quot;reasonable time&quot; had to be accorded within which those with accrued causes of action could comply. A reasonable time could not be so brief as to amount to practical denial of opportunity to pursue the claim. Therefore, the 1993 Amendment could not be applied to the company's application for a refund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court considered what the consequences would be of its conclusion that the exemption statute discriminated against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause. The corporation urged the court to sever the language in the exemption statute that caused unconstitutional discrimination and to apply the exemption statute to all rents of flight training equipment. The Commissioner suggested that the court withdraw exemption from payers of tax under Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 270.071 to 270.079, the flight property tax. The court held that the legislature's intent to exempt flight property taxpayers from sales tax had been clear since the enactment of the sales and use tax in 1967. The court thus rejected the Commissioner's position, finding that to do so would negate the legislature's intent to benefit flight property taxpayers. The court instead severed the words &quot;taxed under the provisions of &sect;&sect; 270.071 to 270.079&quot; from the exemption statute. The court also reversed the Commissioner's order that imposed a sales tax on rents from leases of flight training equipment and the denial of the corporation's claim for a refund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">WCRA was not a state agency, but was established as a nonprofit association. The court held that the legislature did not intend to treat WCRA as a mutual property and casualty insurance company. Noting that Minn.

Stat. ch. 317A, by law it could not incorporate under Minn. Stat. ch. 300. The court rejected WCRA's argument that it operated in essence as a mutual insurance company. It stated that organizationally and operationally, WCRA, as governed by Minn. Stat. ch. 79, was significantly different from mutual companies governed by Minn. Stat. ch. 66A. Finally, the court rejected WCRA's argument that it should be taxed in the same manner as the State Fund Mutual Insurance Company, also created by the legislature. The court stated that it was clear that the legislature intended the State Fund to have the powers and responsibilities of a domestic mutual insurance company, and it was equally clear that the legislature did not create WCRA with the same powers and responsibilities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1981, Minnesota enacted an income tax credit for qualified research and experimental expenditures applicable to individuals who were shareholders in an S Corporation.

The law allowed the entire amount of the excess unused credit for the taxable year to be carried back to each of the three preceding years and then forward as a credit carryover to each of the 15 succeeding taxable years. In 1985, the legislature repealed the credit for individuals if acquired after December 31, 1984. When the taxpayers carried the credits forward by reporting them on their 1989 and 1990 returns as credits, the commissioner disallowed them on the basis that the credit had been eliminated by the 1985 repeal. On appeal, the court reversed except as to the 1985 return. The repeal of the research and development credit did not eliminate the credit that the taxpayers had already earned in 1983 and 1984, nor did it prevent them from carrying the credit forward. In the absence of any indication by the legislature that the repeal should have been applied retroactively to eliminate the 1983 and 1984 credit, the changes were prospective only.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By Minn. Stat. &sect; 349.212, subd. 6 (1989), the legislature imposed a graduated tax on the combined receipts of organizations engaged in lawful gambling. The Graduated Combined Receipts Tax established four classes based on the amount of an organization's gross receipts, and the tax was imposed at higher rates on the greater gross receipts, without deduction for the prize payouts. The statute had two objectives: to raise revenue and to protect smaller lawful gambling organizations that were being squeezed out of the market because patrons preferred lawful gambling organizations whose large gross receipts permitted larger payouts under the prior tax scheme, which imposed the tax on receipts after deduction of payouts. The court dismissed appeals by lawful gambling organizations that challenged the Graduated Combined Receipts Tax as a denial of equal protection guaranteed by Minn. Const. art. X, &sect; 1, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV to the federal Constitution. Raising revenue through taxes was a valid legislative objective and the graduated classification was based on genuine and substantial distinctions that were relevant to a valid legislative regulation of the lawful gambling industry.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer was in possession of valuation notices for 1990 and 1991 and filed his petition before a certain date, as required by the &sect; 278.01. The taxpayer was entitled to dismiss challenges to two parcels because each parcel at issue was valued separately by the assessor; thus, the assessor's valuations remained unchanged. The County's remedy as to those parcels, if they were incorrectly valued, was to correct the valuation in a future year. The classification of the real property did not affect the value of the real property, but its rate of tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the County's motion to dismiss the taxpayer's challenge to the 1991 assessed values of the taxpayer's real property. The court granted the taxpayer's motion to dismiss the petition with regard to two parcels. The county's motion to allow a challenge of classification was denied. The court rescheduled the matter for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property in question was the homeowners' farm, 19 acres of which was used for farmland, one acre of which was used as a home area. The court found that the farm acreage could enjoy Green Acres classification under &sect; 273.111, subd. 12, and that the acre on which the house sat was residential. In response to the county's motions, the homeowners argued that the county's motion for reconsideration or new trial involved issues not raised in the briefs. The court agreed and denied the motion. The court held that it had jurisdiction over the county's constitutional argument because the file had been transferred from the district court. The court held that transferring the file back was unnecessary. The court held that the application of the Green Acres classification to the property was proper. The court noted that almost all farms had homesteads. The court denied the motion for new trial, holding that the county did not point to any errors in the original judgment.</SPAN></P>

The fact that &sect; 60A.19, subd. 6 excluded a similar association assessment from the calculation did not mean that the legislature intended to also exclude the assessment under Minn.

The corporation collected the sales tax on the discounted price of the meals. The commissioner asserted that the corporation should have also collected a &quot;use&quot; tax on the discounted portion of the meals provided to the employees. The commissioner's tax on the discounted portion applied only to the restaurant and did not apply to other industries such as retail sales. The commissioner interpreted an amendment to Minn. Stat. &sect; 297A.01, subd. 3(c) (1987) to require the collection of the tax on the discounted portion of the meals. The court noted that although the statute did not specifically state that a tax had to be paid on the difference between the discounted price of the meal and its fair market value, the commissioner interpreted that it mandated the imposition of a use tax on the discounted portion. The court held that it was not the intent of the legislature to impose both a sales and a use tax on the discounted meals provided to restaurant employees, and that the commissioner's order imposing the tax was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The county argued that reassessment was permitted under Minn. Stat. &sect; 273.11, subd. 1 (1988) and that similar lots included only those on the same street as the owners' lot. In affirming the assessment, the court ruled that similarly situated property included other lots in the same subdivision, not necessarily fronting on the same street and that the &quot;same street&quot; requirement under &sect; 273.11, subd. 1 defined in part which lots were eligible for reassessment but did not necessarily limit the inquiry regarding equal treatment. The court further ruled that &sect; 273.11, subd. 1 was aimed at bringing newly plotted subdivisions up to market value without burdening the developer excessively and that there was a rational basis for valuing the lots that had sold at full market value even though the unsold lots remained at below-market levels. The court held that an unequal assessment inquiry was focused on the subject lot as compared to other lots that had been sold as of the assessment date, and there was no dissimilarity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer claimed that, because he had been criminally prosecuted for possessing the marijuana on which the tax and penalty was assessed under Minn.

After stipulating that the quantity of marijuana found in the taxpayer's possession was less than the quantity on which the assessment was based, the issue was submitted to the court on briefs. Presuming that the statute was constitutional and noting that its power to declare a statute unconstitutional was to be with caution, the court concluded that the taxpayer failed to meet his burden of proving that assessment of the tax and penalty violated either constitutional guaranty. The sentencing order that the taxpayer belatedly submitted with his reply brief to show a prior punishment for possession of the same marijuana bore a date after the tax was assessed, did not state the date or circumstances of the incident leading to the sentencing, and, thus, did not prove that the sentencing was a prior punishment for possessing the same marijuana.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer filed an action against the Commissioner, challenging the constitutionality of the assessment. The taxpayer did not dispute the facts upon which the assessment was based, but claimed that the application of the controlled substance tax to persons such as himself, who possessed large quantities of controlled substances for their own personal use rather than for sale to others, was a violation of the equal protection provisions of the state and federal constitutions. The Commissioner moved for summary judgment. The court found that the legislature's classification of those persons subject to the marijuana and controlled substances tax was not arbitrary and that it rested upon differences having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation. It was not unreasonable to tax heavy users as well as sellers because the sale itself was illegal and, therefore, not readily discovered or reported, unlike the sale of tobacco and liquor where the tax could readily be collected and monitored at the point of sale.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney represented the taxpayer in criminal proceedings in which the taxpayer entered a guilty plea for the sale of the marijuana that was the subject of the tax stamp assessment.

The attorney maintained the taxpayer's appeal but at trial offered no evidence to satisfy the taxpayer's burden of proving that the Commissioner's order was not valid or correctly determined, as required by Minn.

Under Minn.

After the purchase was completed, the county assessor placed an estimated market value on the property in an amount that exceeded the sale price. The taxpayers challenged the assessment. Following a hearing, the court ordered that the amount be reduced in the city and county records. The sale of the subject property at or near the assessment date was entitled to great weight in the determination of its value. The court rejected the argument that, because other agricultural property was assessed in excess of market value, the reduction of assessment at issue would create unconstitutional inequality in the taxing district. The owners of those other properties could have asked for a reduction, and their failure to exercise their statutory right under Minn. Stat. &sect; 278.01 could not act as a defense to the granting of relief to the taxpayers in exercising their statutory rights.</SPAN></P>

The commissioner found that there was no indicia to show that the tax on the cocaine had been paid, and imposed the tax in an amount based on the weight of the cocaine in the taxpayer's possession. The taxpayer challenged the assessment of the tax on the basis that the statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 297D, created a presumption that anyone in possession of more than 7 grams of cocaine had to be a dealer. The taxpayer claimed that he was not a dealer because he lacked the intent to distribute the cocaine. The court found that the taxpayer presented no facts to dispute that he possessed 56 grams of cocaine, or that tax stamps were not affixed to the cocaine. The court found that the taxpayer attempted to rewrite the legislature's definition of &quot;dealer&quot; found in Minn. Stat. &sect; 297D.01, subd. 3. The court found that the legislature was clear in its definition, and held that there was no requirement that intent be found before one could be considered a dealer.

The basis for the appeal consisted of the word &quot;unconstitutional.&quot; The constitutionality of the statute upon which the tax and penalty were based was pending in the courts at the time of the filing of the notice of appeal. The statute was subsequently held to be constitutional. Counsel for the Commissioner asserted that the taxpayer was later advised of an error in the calculation and that the correct tax that was due was actually higher than that which was originally assessed. The court granted the Commissioner's motion for summary judgment in the amount of the original tax assessment. The court held that the reason that was stated for the appeal had no validity because the Minnesota Supreme Court had held that the statute that was at issue was constitutional. Further, the court held that the order of the Commissioner was, by Minn. Stat. &sect; 271.06, subd. 6, accorded prima facie validity. Finally, the court noted that there was no indication that the correction notice was in the form of an appealable order. Thus, the court held that entering an order for the higher amount would have violated due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer appealed the decision of the commissioner that denied a refund for dividends from mutual funds that were invested in government securities. The court reversed the decision of the commissioner to disallow the deduction on government securities. The court affirmed the commissioner's ruling that certain interest from investments that were only guaranteed by the federal government were not tax-exempt. The court held that the tax on dividends attributable to interest on U.S. government securities violated 31 U.S.C.S. 3124(a) and was prohibited by the United States Constitution. The &quot;dividends&quot; here were quite different from the discretionary dividends declared by the board of directors of a business corporation. The court noted that mutual funds were passive investment vehicles only -- a pooling of shareholders' funds that allowed diverse holdings and professional investment management. They were not operating business corporations. The mutual funds simply passed tax-exempt income through to the shareholders. The court held that, unlike government securities, stocks that were simply guaranteed by the government were not tax-exempt.</SPAN></P>

The county challenged the constitutionality of the exemption of the taxpayers' property from taxation. The taxpayers owned a stadium that was leased to professional sports teams. The court rejected the county's assertion that it lacked jurisdiction and noted that, while it might have lacked jurisdiction to previously rule on constitutional issues raised in a prior action, the jurisdictional defect had been cured, and the court had jurisdiction over all the files related to the action. The court held that the assessor's oath to uphold the constitution did not confer standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute that exempted property from taxation. The court held that there was no public interest in the challenge, and the assessor was merely performing his ministerial duties. The court found no public interest in the county's challenge and found that the county confused public interest with the public purpose behind the publicly supported construction of the stadium.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner claimed that 1988 Minn. Laws 719 was unconstitutional in that it violated the uniformity clause by assessing property with the same tax value, within the same tax district, at different tax rates. The property owner claimed that there was no rational basis for the taxing scheme and that the reduction aid was paid without regard to the level of local government services provided to the citizenry. The court held that the disparity reduction aid provided by 1988 Minn. Laws 719 was constitutional. The court held the Legislature's use of unique taxing jurisdictions (UTJs) to meet the funding needs of the State's political subdivisions was a legitimate exercise of the State's power to levy property taxes, even though it resulted in disparate payment of taxes by those that were seemingly similarly situated. The court found that the law bore a rational relationship to a legitimate government purpose, in part by targeting tax relief where it would most likely reduce disparities in overall tax burdens. The court did not find that the law was invalidated by procedural errors and found that the law had been reported on three separate days as required.</SPAN></P>

The county also filed a motion for summary judgment. Both motions were consolidated for the hearing. Pursuant to the public property leased to private entities statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 473.556, subd. 3 (1977), the county contended that the Commission and baseball team could be assessed taxes for the part of the stadium that they exclusively used. The Commission and the baseball team contended that the county did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the 1985 amendment to the statute. The court held that there was not a genuine issue of material fact and granted summary judgment in favor of the Commission and the baseball team. The court concluded that the subject property of the Commission, which was leased to the baseball team, was exempt from real property taxes in the 1986 and 1987 assessments.</SPAN></P>

The Commissioner denied his request on the grounds that he filed his claim outside of the required statutory period. The taxpayer appealed. In affirming the Commissioner's order, the court held that the taxpayer did not have a vested right to the refund at the time he filed. The court found that the taxpayer lost his right to apply for the tax refund when the legislature changed the statute of limitations for requesting the refund from two years to one year. The court stated that it was within the legislature's power to make the changes and to make them retroactive because no vested right was created by the law being passed initially. The court determined that the taxpayer should have filed his request within the required time in order to claim his refund. The court found that the taxpayer's right to a refund would have become vested only when he actually made the claim and at the time he made his claim the statute of limitations had run.</SPAN></P>

The corporation computed its Minnesota income tax pursuant to Minn.

Thus, the court ruled the corporation's net operating loss deduction must have been apportioned because &sect; 290.095, subd. 3(c) required as much where the corporation conducted business inside and outside Minnesota and apportioned its income pursuant to &sect; 290.19. The court rejected the corporation's contention that &sect; 290.095, subd. 3(c) was inapplicable since the liquidated corporation's income was not apportionable to Minnesota because the state of that entity was liquidated in the carryover year.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner ordered the taxpayer to pay additional corporate franchise taxes. The taxpayer appealed. In affirming the Commissioner's order, the court concluded that the Commissioner correctly excluded the taxpayer's net sales, payroll, and property in calculating the taxpayer's apportionable income. The court found that the taxpayer failed to meet its burden of showing that the apportionment formula was constitutionally defective. The court noted that Minnesota was only taxing the taxpayer's actual intangible income it received by doing business in the state. The court held that the taxpayer's worldwide values of sales, property, and payroll were properly excluded from the Commissioner's apportionment factor because to have included that value would have distorted the apportionment formula in favor of the taxpayer. The court found there was no violation of the Due Process or Commerce Clauses in the Commissioner's method of apportionment used to assess the taxpayer's additional franchise taxes. The court concluded that it did not have the authority to rule on the constitutionality of Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.21(4) (1980) because the case was not transferred from the tax court.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the County's contention that newly discovered evidence indicated that while there were six sales listed in the revenue department's assessment/sales ratio study for a specified location, one of them should not have been included in the study given that it involved only some property in that location and, thus, the sale should not have been included. Given that the County had several years before trial to investigate the certificates of real estate value for the properties in the location, the court concluded that there was no newly discovered evidence that could not have been discovered with due diligence. The court also rejected the contention that a sample size of six or less was insufficient to sustain a finding of inequality in an assessment/sales ration case. Explaining, the court noted while the sales represented all of the arms-length sales as compiled by the department, these studies were not conclusive. No authority established that six sales were required to constitute a valid study.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the taxpayer was not entitled to the full homestead classification on the property. The court noted that Minn.

The policy was supported by the attorney general's opinions, affirmed by the courts, and acquiesced in by the legislature.

The Commissioner calculated the taxpayers' tax liability at the same rate as an in-state resident would pay with the same total income, pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.06 subd. 2c(c). The taxpayers appealed the order and contended that their total income should not have been used to determine their Minnesota tax liability because that resulted in taxing their out-of-state income twice. The taxpayers argued that the statute was unconstitutional as it violated equal protection principles. The court affirmed the Commissioner and held that the taxpayers' out-of-state income was not being taxed. The total income produced the tax rate to apply to the taxpayers' in-state taxable income, which was the same rate applied to the income of in-state residents having the same total income. This placed the taxpayers on an equal basis with residents with the same income.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers operated a wine wholesale distributorship. All of their wines were imported from outside the state. Minn. Stat. &sect; 340.436 (1984) mandated a lower tax for Minnesota produced wines. The taxpayers filed a claim with the Commissioner for the refund of excise taxes they had paid pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 340.47 over the rate assessed on Minnesota wines on sales for a certain time period. The Commissioner denied the claim. Later, the taxpayers withheld payment of the alleged excess taxes and filed an objection to excise taxes payable in a certain time period. By order, the Commissioner determined that the taxpayers were liable for the taxes that they had withheld. The taxpayers sought review. On appeal, the court upheld the order. The court ruled that Minn. Stat. &sect; 340.436 (1984) was unconstitutional and therefore invalid during the period in question. The court held however that the unconstitutionality of &sect; 340.436 did not affect the validity of Minn. Stat. &sect; 340.47. The court concluded that the excise taxes assessed against the taxpayers under &sect; 340.47 were valid and proper because the taxpayers failed to show an adverse impact on their business.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner issued an order assessing a telephone gross earnings tax against the taxpayer and including ENFIA payments received by the taxpayer in its gross earnings. On appeal, the court granted partial summary judgment affirming the order because Minn. Stat. &sect; 295.34 did not facially exclude ENFIA payments from gross earnings. Full summary judgment was not granted because the question of the dollar amounts to include was still at issue. The taxpayer filed a motion for a rehearing, asserting that it had new material to support its argument that a long-standing administrative interpretation of the telephone gross earnings statute existed, under which rents received by a gross earnings taxpayer from another gross earnings taxpayer were excluded from the recipient's gross earnings. The taxpayer also offered opinions of courts from other jurisdictions. The court denied the taxpayer's motion because &sect; 295.34 was clear on its face, and there was no need to look further for aid in its interpretation. The court granted the Commissioner's motion for full summary judgment because both parties agreed that the dispute regarding the amounts of the payments had been settled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer operated a crushed rock plant for the production of aggregate material. The county assessed an aggregate production tax, as provided by Minn. Stat. &sect; 298.75, on the taxpayer's production. The taxpayer filed a statement of objection, contending that the tax was unconstitutional. The court found that the taxpayer had shown beyond a reasonable doubt that &sect; 298.75 did not meet the requirements of uniformity and equal protection under either the Minnesota Constitution or the United States Constitution. There was no rational basis for the State of Minnesota to levy the aggregate production tax in 22 specific counties and to exempt the levy of the tax in the rest of the counties of the State. Aggregate and rock suitable for crushing were found broadly across the State. Accordingly, the court held that &sect; 298.75 violated the Uniformity Clause of the Minnesota Constitution and the Equal Protection Clauses of the Minnesota Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner property owner sought review of an assessment of fair market value of the owner's property by respondent County of Hennepin, Minnesota.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner introduced unadjusted assessment/sales ratio studies prepared by the Minnesota Department of Revenue indicating median ratios for commercial/industrial property in Minneapolis of 88.9 percent for 1983 and 84.6 percent for 1984. The County countered with assessment/sales ratio studies using essentially the same sales as used in the Department study, but adjusting the sale prices for cash equivalency and inflation. The adjustments raised the median ratios to 93.5 percent for 1983 and to 92.8 percent for 1984. The court found that the general level of assessment at which other properties were taxed was 93 percent of market value for both 1983 and 1984. The court determined that a 93 percent level of assessment did not constitute an unconstitutional denial of equal protection because there had to be a substantial disparity in assessment ratios before an equal protection violation was found. Thus, in the absence of evidence of arbitrary or systematic substantial undervaluation of other property within the same taxing district, the court concluded that the owner was not denied equal protection.</SPAN></P>
