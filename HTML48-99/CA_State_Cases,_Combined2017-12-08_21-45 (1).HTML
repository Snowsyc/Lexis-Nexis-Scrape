</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of two counts of indecent exposure under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 314, after he walked through a college campus building wearing nothing but tennis shoes, stopping to pose for two women. Appellant's prior felony convictions under &sect; 314 converted the offenses to felonies. Appellant sought review. The court reversed, finding that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of disorderly conduct because both offenses required &quot;lewd&quot; conduct in a public place. Evidence of similar incidents in which defendant was sighted nude was only relevant to the issue of sexual intent, not for the purposes of showing identity, characteristic method, or motive. Defendant had not contested the identity issue, evidence of other acts did not establish a motive on defendant's part, and the characteristic method issue was another way of describing identity. The recidivist provision of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 314 was still valid, and the proper punishment was under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 18.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant union organizers appealed a judgment from the municipal court (California) which convicted them of criminal trespass under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 602(n).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A municipal court jury found defendant union organizers guilty of violating Cal. Penal Code &sect; 602(n) by trespassing upon a farm labor camp leased to a farm labor contractor. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction of one defendant and reversed judgment as to the other. California's Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975 (ALRA), Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 1140 et seq., did not divest the municipal court of jurisdiction in this case, the court held, because the ALRA specifically excluded farm labor contractors from its coverage pursuant to Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 1140.4(c). Thus, the court concluded, the farm labor contractor was definitionally incapable of an unfair labor practice. Noting that the ALRA provided practicable alternative channels of communication, the court determined that union access to the labor contractor's camp was not necessary to the fulfillment of the inhabitants' rights under Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 1152. However, finding no evidence from which a jury could reasonably infer that any peace officer requested one of the defendants to leave the private property, the court reversed his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the state labor regulations did not preempt prosecution of defendant union organizers for criminal trespass. However, finding the evidence insufficient to support one the conviction as to one defendant, the court reversed the judgment as to him and affirmed as to the other defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the lower court (California) convicting him of conspiracy to violate criminal laws under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 182, subd. 2, operating a home-finding agency without a license under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 1310, and advertising without a license under Cal. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from convictions of conspiracy to violate criminal laws under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 182, subd. 2, operating a home-finding agency without a license under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 1310, and advertising without a license under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 224p, the court reversed the first two convictions and upheld the advertising without a license conviction. The court held that defendant held no license or permit to run an adoption service, and that the business of defendant was obtaining children for adoption. While U.S. Const. amend. I correlated the right of free speech and press with the right of a private citizen to place an advertisement, it did not mean that any advertisement was appropriate. The court was required to balance the interests of the state in restricting advertisements with the right of free speech and press. The prosecution stated that Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 224p was a part of the regulatory scheme for adoptions and regulation was a valid exercise of the state's police power. The court held that when the legislature repealed a criminal statute, the dismissal of a pending criminal proceeding charging such conduct was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's convictions of operating a home-finding agency without a license and conspiracy to violate criminal laws. The court affirmed a conviction of advertising without a license. Defendant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus was denied. The court concluded that the statute upon which the reversed convictions were based was repealed and dismissal was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant homeowners sought review of a judgment from the trial court (California) that dismissed its petition for writ of mandate under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1085, and Cal. Govt. Code &sect; 65860(a) and (c), after sustaining the demurrer of respondent county board supervisors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of judgment sustaining respondent county board supervisors' demurrer and dismissing appellants' petition for writ of mandate. Appellants claimed that respondent disregarded a mandatory duty imposed by Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 65860(c) to change an agricultural use zoning ordinance to conform to the applicable community general plan. Appellants sought to compel respondent to hold further hearings to obtain such compliance. The court reversed the trial court dismissal and remanded, concluding the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer based on the reasoning that the refusal to rezone was a discretionary legislative act. The court determined where, as in the present case, the statute defined specific duties, the course of conduct the governing body was required to take became mandatory and eliminated any element of discretion. The court elaborated that respondent was required to amend a zoning ordinance into community plan conformity when it became inconsistent with the general plan by reason of amendment. The court indicated if respondent did not rezone within a reasonable time, a writ could issue.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's order. In so ruling, the court rejected appellant's argument that the four year statute of limitations period set forth Cal. Civ. Proc.

The court also rejected appellant's argument that the filing period should not have commenced until appellant was aware of the error in the fees, noting that the period commenced when the state's obligation for the faulty fee was incurred. Finally, the court held that respondent was not estopped from denying appellant's claim because of its error, noting that appellant had a duty to correct the error within three years under &sect; 42232.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's son died as an inmate in jail, due to congestive heart failure brought on by the son's heroin addiction. Appellant filed a class action for equitable relief on behalf of heroin addicts who were or would in the future be incarcerated in the jail and to have declared and enjoined, as unconstitutional, the practices of respondents in failing to provide adequate medical treatment for admittees to the jail. The court affirmed the dismissal of appellant's action. The court held that a class action was inappropriate because appellant was not a member of the class. The court also held that appellant could not sue in his own right for the deprivation of his son's rights apart from his remedy under the wrongful death cause of action. The court held that appellant's claim failed to allege an action for damages for the wrongful death of his son.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of appellant's class action based on the failure to supply treatment to appellant's son in jail because appellant lacked standing to either bring a class action on behalf of heroin addicted prison inmates, or to assert the deprivation of his son's civil rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, an institutionalized person, sought a writ of habeas corpus to a California trial court. The trial court had disapproved the recommendation that petitioner be released on parole, pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 7375(c), from the institution in which she had been confined since being found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, an institutionalized person, pleaded not guilty, by reason of insanity, to murder, and was committed to a hospital to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1026. After a period of treatment, petitioner presented uncontroverted testimony at a parole hearing that her release posed no health or safety danger, and that she would benefit from parole. Nonetheless, the trial court disapproved of the recommendation, and denied parole. Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus, pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 7375(c), claiming abuse of discretion. The court agreed. It held that uncontradicted testimony that is not inherently improbable cannot be arbitrarily disregarded, and should have been accepted as true, unless the trial court found that the witness was not telling the truth, or his testimony was inherently improbable due to inaccuracy, uncertainty, lapse of time, interest, or bias. Because the lower court record did not set out precise grounds upon which the parole denial was based, and because due process required such specificity, the court remanded, directing the trial court to conduct further hearings, and to specifically state its reasons for further rulings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's disapproval of a recommendation, made by the medical director of a mental institution, that petitioner, an institutionalized person, be released on parole. The court found that the absence from the trial court's order of the precise grounds on which the lower court relied in denying parole required remand, for further hearing and consideration, so that an adequate record could be made.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution sought review of an order of the Contra Costa County Superior Court (California), which suspended the execution of defendant's sentence and granted him probation after defendant pleaded guilty to robbery and possession of a firearm by an ex-felon within the meaning of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022.5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to robbery and possession of a firearm by an ex-felon. He admitted to use of a firearm within the meaning of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022.5, requiring the imposition of mandatory additional punishment. The trial court sentenced him to probation, finding that while defendant used a firearm within the meaning of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022.5, as specifically alleged in the information, he did not use a firearm within the meaning of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203.06, requiring that he be denied probation. The court reversed, holding that the trial court erred in granted defendant probation because &quot;use&quot; within the meaning of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022.5 was not different from &quot;use&quot; within the meaning of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203.06. It was reasonable to assume that the legislature intended &quot;use&quot; to mean the same for Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 12022.5 and 1203.06, and the information, by alleging use of a firearm, within the meaning of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022.5, adequately informed defendant of the charge against him. Defendant was afforded adequate notification that there was a possibility he would not have been eligible for probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed. Defendant was erroneously granted probation, because probation had to be denied based on his &quot;use of a firearm,&quot; which he had admitted to as part of his plea agreement. The trial court was directed to enter judgment in accordance with the court's opinion, or in its discretion, upon defendant's motion, to vacate defendant's pleas of guilty to all allegations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant schizophrenic sought relief from an order by the Superior Court of Solano County (California), granting respondent guardian's petition for appointment as conservator under the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect;&sect; 5000 et seq. Appellant also filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to obtain release from his allegedly unlawful confinement at a state hospital, attacking the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An investigation report recommended conservatorship of appellant schizophrenic as he was gravely disabled as a result of a mental disorder under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 5008. After consulting with counsel, appellant waived an adversarial hearing. On appeal from an order appointing a conservator and confining appellant to a state hospital, the court held that in the context of the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (Act), Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect;&sect; 5000 et seq., the gravely disabled standard was constitutionally precise and, as it required a causal link between a specifically defined and diagnosed mental disorder and an inability to care for one's basic needs, the term was neither constitutionally vague nor overbroad. The court held that as appellant was represented by counsel and waived his right to file a motion for a trial following the conservator appointment, the lower court was not required to voir dire appellant of his right to a jury trial and confrontation. The trial court was entitled to conclude that there was a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver and retroactive application of the on-the-record voir dire under Cal. Prob. Code &sect; 1754.1 was not constitutionally required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order appointing a conservator was affirmed and appellant schizophrenic's petition for writ of habeas corpus was denied, because appellant's waiver of his right to jury trial on the issue of grave disability was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent, and was not constitutionally defective for lack of an on-the-record voir dire.</SPAN></P>

It concluded that the illumination had a secular purpose of promoting peace and good fellowship, that it did not have the primary effect of promoting religion, and that it did not foster an excessive entanglement between government and religion. Therefore, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and held that appellant's practice of temporarily illuminating the windows in city hall in the form of a cross did not violate the establishment clause of U.S. Const. amend.

The court held that the Political Reform Act of 1974 (Act) prohibited state and local government officials from participating in decisions where it appeared that the outcome would likely benefit a corporation by whom he or she was employed. The court found that decisions on the development of land across the street from the shopping center could affect the value of the company's investment and thus, under the Act, appellant was properly enjoined from participating in any decisions regarding the shopping center.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 12031(e). The court found that the Taser was a firearm because it was designed as a weapon. Second, the court determined that the Taser's met the component of being expelled by force or combustion because the Taser operated by electrical ignition of smokeless powder and because its barbed contactors could have been considered a barrel within the ordinary meaning of the term. Consequently, the Taser was a firearm within section 12031(a). The court found that a Taser was a loaded firearm under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12031(e) because, upon insertion of the barbed contactors, the Taser was loaded. The court found the due process notice requirements were met by Cal.

The court granted petitioner's writ of habeas corpus and directed that the trial court's order, which granted letters of guardianship, be vacated and petitioner be discharged and remanded to juvenile court. The court found that petitioner could not be voluntarily committed by a guardian under the provisions of Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 6000 because the legislature had denied the juvenile court the authority to commit such a ward, and the court could not circumvent the law by appointing a guardian to do so. The court found that under the Lanterman-Petris-Short-Act, Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case involved two appeals, which were consolidated for the purposes of argument and decision, arising out of challenges to the validity of taxes paid to the City of County of San Francisco by each of the taxpayers. The taxes in question were assessed in 1967 as escaped assessments under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax Code &sect; 531, on the basis of reappraisals and reassessments of personal property for the years 1964, 1965, and 1966. The reappraisals were the result of the &quot;Knoff Mandate,&quot; which followed a grand jury investigation and finding of improprieties associated with the assessment practices in those years. The taxpayers argued that the city could not assert a right to collect taxes from those among the disfavored taxpayers who allegedly received special treatment through assessments lower than generally imposed on business inventories and equipment, because they were still assessed higher than the general ratio to actual market value of assessments of all taxable property within the city and county. The court generally agreed and affirmed the judgment in favor of one of the taxpayers and reversed the judgment against the other taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of one taxpayer but declined to permit recovery of anything more than simple interest.

After respondent had terminated an automobile franchise for failure to develop a sufficient sales volume, the dealer successfully pursed an administrative remedy under the Dealers Day in Court Act (Act), 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1221 et seq. (1974), causing respondent to seek and obtain the writ. On appeal, the court held that &sect;&sect; 3060-3069 of the Act violated constitutional due process by mandating that appellant be composed of nine members, four of whom were required to be automobile dealers while none were required to be automobile manufacturers. Because dealer-members of respondent had an inherent economic stake in every franchise termination case that came before respondent and because respondent determined whether good cause existed to terminate a franchise, a pecuniary conflict of interest existed. The court affirmed the trial court's grant of a writ of mandate to respondent.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and found that an unborn child was not included under the ambit of Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 377. The court found that prior cases and legislative history did not identify an unborn child as a person under the statute. The court noted that the language of Cal. Civ. Proc.

The court did not find any constitutional violation in the classification of parents of minors and parents of unborn children, because the wrongful death statute was intended to redress pecuniary loss. The court found that parents of unborn children suffered mental anguish caused by death that was not compensable by the statute.

The court held that the provision that precluded a second offender from parole consideration without statutory regard to the existence of such mitigating circumstances as possible addict status and the quantity of narcotics involved for the current as well as the prior offense was cruel and unusual punishment in violation of Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a trial by jury, respondent defendant was found guilty of robbery in the first degree. The jury also found that he had used a firearm in the commission of the offense. The trial court originally sentenced respondent to prison. However, in contravention of Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Real party in interest, a California resident, was injured in an automobile accident in Nevada with petitioner Nevada resident. Real party filed a complaint in California against petitioner. Respondent superior court granted petitioner's motion to quash service of the summons. Real party filed a writ of attachment on petitioner's insurance carrier in California. Respondent denied petitioner's motion to quash. Petitioner's counsel filed an answer with a disclaimer that he did not intend to be subject to personal jurisdiction. Respondent denied petitioner's motions to quash and to reconsider. The court denied petitioner's request for a writ of mandate or prohibition, dissolved the temporary stay, and discharged the show cause order. The court held that respondent did not err in denying petitioner's motion to quash, because he was subject to personal jurisdiction by his general appearance. The court held that petitioner's remedy for unauthorized representation was a motion to withdraw the appearance. The court applied a supreme court decision retroactively to find that respondent had no quasi in rem jurisdiction over the insurer's obligation to indemnify.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers appealed the decision of the Superior Court of Contra Costa County (California) granting summary judgment to defendants, a city manager, assistant city manager, chief of police, and two police officers, on plaintiffs' claims that police department policies authorized the use of deadly force to apprehend nonviolent felony suspects in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 196, 197, and 837 (1872) and Cal. Penal Code &sect; 835a (1957).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers filed an action against defendants, a city manager, assistant city manager, chief of police, and two police officers. Plaintiffs alleged that certain of the city police department's policies, which illegally allowed deadly force in the apprehension of nonviolent felony suspects, constituted an unlawful expenditure of tax funds and an unlawful waste of public property in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 196, 197, and 837 (1872), and Cal. Penal Code &sect; 835a (1957) (the statutes). The lower court denied plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief and granted summary judgment to defendants, and the court affirmed. It noted that while the statutes did not distinguish between violent and nonviolent felonies and appeared to authorize the use of deadly force in arresting an attempted or actual nonviolent felon, the courts interpreted the statutes more strictly to prohibit the use of deadly force against a fleeing felony suspect unless the suspected felony was violent. The police department's policies conformed to the statutes and their interpretations by authorizing deadly force only against violent felonies. Thus, the statutes were neither unconstitutional nor invalid.</SPAN></P>

Const. amend. XIV. The court held that in order to have a property interest in public employment, an individual must have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it. Appellant had no constitutionally protected property right to his job as principal. Appellant alleged that the reason stated for his transfer, reduction of the administrative staff, was not supported by the facts. The court conceded that an employer who was obliged to reduce his reasons for terminating a particular employment relationship to writing might be more cautious in seeing that his discretion was wisely exercised. The court held, however, that appellant was unable to persuade them that respondent acted beyond its powers in changing appellant's employment status, and affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The injunction was issued on a verified complaint with limited evidentiary hearings. The court affirmed the granting of the preliminary injunction, and held that newly enacted Ca. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 527.3 did not change existing law and bar courts from enjoining strikes by public employees, even though its language appeared to contradict existing law. The court held that in the absence of specific legislative authority, public employees still did not have the right to strike and courts could bar related activities that interfered with legitimate state interests. The injunction was not a decision on the merits and could be granted on a verified complaint with limited evidence, and while better specificity in the complaint was desirable, the allegations of interference with essential governmental services were sufficient. Any failures of plaintiff to mediate or abide by its charter were not &quot;unclean hands&quot; and could be raised in another forum.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a taxpayer group and individual taxpayers, sought to enjoin defendants, school district trustees and others, from implementing a school consolidation plan. Plaintiffs alleged defendants had failed to consider far less costly alternatives that would provide the same or better benefits. The trial court sustained defendants' demurrer because Ca. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 526a did not name school districts, so plaintiffs did not have standing or a cause of action under &sect; 526a and waste was not actionable by a taxpayer in a representative capacity at common law. The court reversed, holding that &sect; 526a was liberally construed so that it applied to a school district, an agency of the state. The court also held that because plaintiffs alleged that defendants would be expending public funds on a plan that cost a great deal more than alternative plans considered, without a finding of any additional public benefit such allegations went beyond a mere difference in judgment between plaintiffs and defendants and were sufficient to state a cause of action for waste under &sect; 526a.

The scope of the court's review included the entire proceeding, which culminated in the order granting probation. The court held that Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.

Code &sect; 11350.1 expressly prohibited any cross-complaints for contribution, finding that it did not follow that because &sect; 11350 imposed liability on both parents for support of a deserted child that the one parent could require contribution from the other parent of any support he was required to pay for the child. Although both parents were obligated to the child and to the county for the child's support, they were not obligated to each other. In its discretion, the county decided to bring the support action against appellant alone.

The court affirmed on appeal and held that dismissal was proper because the complaint filed by plaintiffs was objectionable on one of the grounds of uncertainty raised by demurrer and plaintiffs' failed to amend. Specifically, the court held that in order for plaintiffs to have stated a cause of action they had to have pled that the prior convictions were vacated or set aside in the court in which the prior conviction was obtained and the sentence imposed. Their failure to clearly set forth how or in what manner the convictions were declared unconstitutional rendered the complaint subject to demurrer for uncertainty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, residents of Venice, California, claimed that respondent regional commission issued a permit to respondent developer that was void because the public notice of the hearing on the application did not comply with the requirements of Cal.

The notice required by &sect; 27420(b) was merely notice of the nature of the proposed development and not of each and every aspect of the development. The court held that due process did not require any particular notice. The court found that notice of the pending construction of an eight-unit apartment at the site reasonably put any recipient on inquiry as to the likely inclusion of elements which might be inconsistent with the long-range conservation and management of the natural resources of the coastal zone. Any inquiry into the matter would patently have disclosed the facts stated in the application that three lots were involved and that the plan for the development was inconsistent with the continued existence of a tree and dwelling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant dentist was refused permission to open a third dental office by respondent Board of Dental Examiners, because such action would violate Cal.

Appellant sought a writ of mandate against respondent from the trial court, claiming &sect; 1658.1 violated his due process and equal protection rights, but his petition was denied. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of appellant's writ of mandate. The court held that &sect; 1658.1 did not violate appellant's due process rights, because it was not arbitrary and had a reasonable relationship to a legitimate state purpose, i.e., maintaining a close relationship between the dentist and his employees and patients. The court also held that &sect; 1658.1 did not deny appellant equal protection of the laws. The court applied the &quot;rational relationship&quot; test instead of the &quot;close scrutiny&quot; test, because the classification was neither suspect nor touched on fundamental interests.

The trial court sustained the demurrer. The court reversed, finding that although &sect; 217 was neutral on the issue of whether a trainee should be compensated for the training, general contract principles demonstrated that plaintiff had stated a cause of action for overtime pay or for compensating time off. The court also noted that the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 201 et seq., controlled plaintiff's right to compensation in the absence of any provision in the contract of employment to the contrary because from the allegations of the complaint it appeared that attendance at the training sessions was outside of regular working hours, that the attendance was involuntary, and that the training was directly related to the job.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties sought review from a decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which held that Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing that defendants were to accept plaintiffs' petition to cause an election regarding the name change of the city to be placed on the ballot requiring only a simple majority to be determinative. The trial court held that Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 34507 was unconstitutional because it denied general law cities and their electors equal protection of the laws. On appeal, the court stated that in a chartered city, the change of name of a city was manifestly a municipal affair and the matter was in the hands of the residents of the home rule city. However, in the case of a general law city, the determination of the requirements as to a change of name was within the province of the legislature. Thus, the court held that the legislature's determination that a two-thirds favorable vote was required was not unreasonable. The legislature had broad discretion in determining the extent of the vote to be required to effect such a change. The court held that Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 34507 was not arbitrary and that plaintiffs were not entitled to the relief they sought. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect;&sect; 107.2 and 107.3 declared that any result of litigation eliminating a taxpayer's right to exclude royalties in valuing possessory interests in oil and gas leases would be prospective in operation. The new method of valuation would be applicable only to leases entered into after the tax year in which the litigation began. The trial court found &sect;&sect; 107.2 and 107.3&nbsp;unconstitutional because they were unnecessary to alleviate hardship and violated the full value assessment requirement. The court reversed and remanded the judgment for defendants in plaintiffs' action for a refund of taxes paid on oil and gas interests. The trial court was required to analyze the enactments according to their reasonableness in light of the situation presented to the legislature, but failed to do so. The legislature acted reasonably in providing that the changed method of valuation of possessory interests in oil and gas leases was prospective only. The legislature's action was permissible in the context of the case before the court. Once the legislature concluded that a hardship might result by a court decision it could go ahead and pass its prospective legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff California Department of Transportation filed a suit against defendant advertising corporation seeking an order that defendant remove four advertising displays, pursuant to the Outdoor Advertising Act (Act), Cal.

However, it dismissed plaintiff's action at trial as to the others and declared Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 5412&nbsp;unconstitutional. Both parties appealed. The court of appeal reversed summary judgment. There were factual issues in dispute as to whether the signs were in a business area, thus creating an exception pursuant to Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 5407, 5408, that they be removed pursuant to Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 5405. The court also reversed the finding as to the remaining signs and found that &sect; 5412, the compensation section of the Act, did not deny equal protection. The forced removal of signs that violated the Act was within the state's police power to eliminate a nuisance, which did not constitute the unauthorized taking of property. The Act had the rational purpose of maintaining federal highway funds.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled defendant's general demurrer. Defendant requested a peremptory writ, seeking to overturn the trial court's ruling on the demurrer. The court denied the petition for a peremptory writ, holding that the general demurrer at issue was properly overruled. The court found that because the allegations in the complaint sought recovery for harm caused by proprietary actions and omissions as well as for harm caused by aircraft in flight, they were broad enough to state a cause of action. The court limited recovery, however, for tort damages, if any, that arose out of the operation of the airport itself and not those caused by aircraft in flight. The court said that to authorize recovery from the proprietor of an airport for injuries caused by aircraft in flight would permit local liability for conduct within exclusive federal control. The court noted that federal control over aircraft in flight was intensive and exclusive.</SPAN></P>

Respondent transit district began operating a bus route in direct competition with appellant's route. Appellant alleged that it had a property right in its route pursuant to Cal. Const. art.

Code &sect; 98300 that respondent must offer to buy if competing for patronage, but appellant alleged that the definition was arbitrary and invalid. The trial court granted respondent's demurrer. The court affirmed and found that freedom from competition was not a compensable property right under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 19 and Cal. Const. art. XII, &sect; 5 did not bestow any rights of compensation on appellant. The court concluded that appellant was not deprived of equal protection by Cal. Pub. Util.

The court held that it affirmed the trial court's ruling on demurrer if there was any ground raised by respondent that required demurrer. The court found that where drunk driving convictions were declared unconstitutional because of a collateral attack to avoid an enhanced punishment, the conviction still stood with no obligation to return the fines.

The court noted that the legislative body of a city had broad discretion to determine what was reasonable in endeavoring to protect the health, safety, morals and general welfare of its citizens, but that the ordinances it enacted to accomplish these aims must have been reasonable in object and not arbitrary in operation. The court stated that the enforcement of the ordinance would require the removal of hundreds of signs having a conceded value in the millions of dollars and bring about a substantial private loss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The people appealed the decision of the Superior Court of Marin County (California), which granted defendant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Defendant argued that because the evidence was the same for his arrest as for his codefendant's, and because the arrest had been determined to be invalid when the codefendant pursued his appeal, defendant's guilty pleas had to be set aside.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to one count of burglary and the people dismissed three counts of forgery pursuant to a plea bargain. Defendant never filed a motion to suppress evidence pertaining to his arrest. Charged with the same four counts, his codefendant filed a motion to suppress, which was denied. Codefendant was convicted on all counts and was sentenced to prison. Codefendant's convictions were reversed because the reviewing court determined that the arrest of the two men was without probable cause; codefendant's motion to suppress should have been granted. Defendant then sought a writ of habeas corpus, which the trial court granted because of the ruling in the codefendant's case. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that because defendant had had adequate opportunity to challenge the validity of his arrest in the trial court on a direct appeal, but had chosen not to do so, habeas corpus was inappropriately granted. The court held that habeas corpus may have been applicable had defendant's guilt been in question, but defendant freely admitted his guilt, making it inapplicable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order granting defendant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus was reversed because defendant failed to seize the opportunity to challenge his arrest as the &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree&quot; at some stage prior to his conviction. Having failed to do so, habeas corpus was not an appropriate remedy available to him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee attorneys were retained by a client to collect a check given by appellant that had been dishonored for insufficient funds. Appellees sent a letter to appellant that allegedly threatened appellant with criminal prosecution in order to secure payment of the obligation represented by the check. Appellant filed a complaint against appellees that alleged that appellee attorneys, in violation of Cal. Bar. R., Prof. Conduct R. 7-104, had threatened appellant with criminal prosecution to obtain advantage in a civil case, that the threat was made with the intent of inflicting emotional distress, and that severe emotional distress resulted. Appellant's complaint was dismissed by the trial court after appellee's general demurrer had been sustained without leave to amend. The trial court's judgment was reversed on appeal. The court found that appellant's complaint had been sufficient to state a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The court found that the alleged violation of Rule 7-104 was of such an extreme nature as to have been outrageous. The letter at issue was not privileged because the threat could not serve the purpose of litigation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, driver and his passenger, struck a roadside utility pole with their automobile. Replacement of the pole was required. Appellants admitted liability but contested the damage claim, asserting the right to credit for depreciation of the pole. The trial court awarded respondent damages in the amount claimed by respondent. The appellate department of Contra Costa County affirmed, and certified the case to secure uniformity of decision in an area of the law in which many cases, each for moderate amount, aggregated to a substantial sum each year. Appellants contended that depreciation should have been deducted from the value of the pole in computing damages. The court affirmed, and held that a single pole had little or no ascertainable commercial value or fixed service life as an individual entity. Its real value lay in its use with many other such poles in sustaining an entire integrated transmission system. The legislature, in adopting Cal. Pub. Util. Code &sect; 7952 had recognized these problems and established the cost of repair, without depreciation allowance, as the measure of damages for negligent injury to or destruction of individual poles of a transmission line.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment from the appellate department, affirming the judgment from the trial court awarding full damages to respondent utility company for replacement of their utility pole damaged by appellants, driver and his passenger.

Appellant petitioned for a writ of mandate to compel respondent to fix a retroactive salary increase and order it to be paid.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff non-profit hospital held its assets in trust for the purpose of operating a hospital. It then leased its building to a third party, and with the rent proceeds, planned to establish outpatient clinics. In compromise of a monetary claim for past services, plaintiff agreed to pay a pension to the employees of plaintiff religious order. Plaintiffs then filed a declaratory relief action against defendant attorney general, regarding the validity of the lease and pension agreements. The trial court found the lease valid, as well as an agreement to pay a finder's fee to an attorney, but found the pension agreement invalid. Both parties appealed. The appellate court reversed, holding that under the articles of incorporation, plaintiff non-profit hospital's purpose was to operate a hospital, not outpatient clinics. Although plaintiff non-profit hospital could use some of the rental profits to run outpatient clinics, it could not cease operation of a hospital. Because the attorney was not required to have a broker's license, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 10133(c), payment of a finder's fee was valid.

The court found that U.S. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 1 and Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 107 required that it be taxed. The court held that appellant's reliance on Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 107.4 that purportedly excluded from the definition of possessory interest any berth, wharf, etc., when such specific facility was also used intermittently by others, even though such possession, claim, or right to use such facility was paramount to any use by others, was misplaced because the effect of this legislation was to reclassify berths or wharves containing the noted characteristics, so that they were no longer considered property and were therefore tax-exempt.

On appeal, the court construed the language in &sect; 416 to indicate that proof of intention to commit overt acts that are themselves violent or that tend to incite others to violence was requisite to criminal liability under the first part of the statute. The court found that the unlawful act provision in &sect; 416 must be interpreted as reaching conduct that the state may legitimately suppress. Further the court held that &sect; 416 empowered a public official to demand dispersal only where there was probable cause to believe that the purpose of an assembly was unlawful, according to the facts and circumstances of each individual case. The court reversed the superior court's judgments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prospective adoptive parents tried to adopt a refugee child from Cambodia through respondent religious organization. Respondent, who was a state licensed private adoption agency, refused to approve appellants' application for adoption because appellants were not members of the evangelical Protestant church. Appellants filed an action for injunctive relief, and the trial court entered judgment in favor of appellants on its claims for injunctive relief, restraining respondents from placing the children for adoption and ordering the relinquishment of custody by respondent but refused to award appellants attorneys fees. Both parties appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court stated that the activity of private-licensed adoption agencies constituted state action. Accordingly, the court concluded that Cal. Admin. Code tit. 22, &sect; 30643, in order to be given constitutional construction, had to be interpreted to preclude imposition of religious requirements upon prospective adoptive parents beyond the religious matching provisions of the Cal. Admin. Code tit. 22, &sect; 30643. Further, the court refused attorneys fees to appellants given the lack of authority for the award.</SPAN></P>

(municipal code) relating to nudity of waiters, waitresses, and entertainers in establishments which served food or beverages. The court found that the specific definition of &quot;theater&quot; contained in the municipal code invaded the area reserved to the state in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 318.5 and Cal. Penal Code &sect; 318.6 and was therefore invalid. The court found that the municipal code definition imposed additional requirements and was in conflict with state law, but that the definition was easily severable from the rest of the municipal code section in question. The remainder of the municipal code was thus enforceable, and therefore the trial court had erred in restraining enforcement of the entire municipal code section.

The trial court ruled in favor of defendant lessee, finding that the gold clause of the lease was not a contract for payment in gold as a commodity, but was a contract for payment of money, and that defendant was not obligated to pay the rent in gold coin. The trial court held that the joint resolution was not repealed, expressly or impliedly, by the 1973 Act.

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that the course of assessing taxes by defendant tax assessor was an unlawful and unconstitutional application of rule 23 because plaintiffs did not have a possessory interest in the leased premises following expiration of the terms of the leases as required by Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, by an interlocutory decree, was ordered to pay spousal support for six years. The decree and the marital settlement agreement also provided that the support requirement would not be modifiable on any ground and that the support would terminate upon her remarriage. Appellant contended that the provisions prescribing that the support payments were not modifiable, did not divest the court of jurisdiction to revoke the support order. The court disagreed and affirmed because it found that the parties had agreed that spousal support was to continue for six years and that it was not modifiable on any ground except upon the death of either party or the remarriage of former wife in which cases it would terminate. Such an agreement was specifically authorized by Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 4811(b). The agreed spousal support was therefore not modifiable whether or not facts exist that would have brought Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 4801.5 into play.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was arrested and charged with burglary and attempted robbery. A competency hearing was held and evidence of petitioner's incompetency was received from two qualified medical examiners. He was found incompetent due to mental retardation and was remanded to a state hospital with an order to examine petitioner and report its conclusions and recommendations. The superior court later amended its earlier order upon representation by the public guardian that his office was unable to institute conservatorship proceedings for petitioner and directed the department of health to evaluate petitioner and recommend a suitable disposition. Petitioner contended that his confinement was in violation of certain constitutional safeguards. The court denied the writ because it had been determined that petitioner was not likely to regain his competency in the foreseeable future. Therefore, it followed that the pending criminal proceedings against petitioner could no longer provide a valid basis for petitioner's continued involuntary confinement. The court noted that it appeared that the best interests of petitioner would be served by placing his custody in the care of the court.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the tax was a license or privilege tax for revenue which appellant was authorized to impose. The ordinance was a valid tax measure authorized by the city charter and the enabling provisions of the state constitution, Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5, which impliedly empowered chartered cities to levy taxes for general revenue purposes; neither constitutional provisions governing the levy of an income tax, nor state legislation preempted appellant's right to levy the tax, and the ordinance did not violate constitutional equal protection because of any alleged discrimination between residents and nonresidents, or because of the exemption of domestic servants. The ordinance did not unlawfully restrict the right of any nonresident to travel and work outside the city in which he resided and did not unlawfully tax governmental employees.</SPAN></P>

The court found the instruction did not merely require appellant to raise reasonable doubt, but to prove whether or not the homicide was committed by way of self-defense, and it was the state's burden to prove the absence of justification beyond a reasonable doubt.

Appellant also alleged that because its sole criterion was the nature of a prior felony conviction, it was an unconstitutional statutory presumption.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent individuals brought suit to recover sums paid under protest to appellant Franchise Tax Board after their pursuit of administrative remedies was exhausted. Respondents sought tax credits for taxes they paid to Georgia on income derived from ownership in a corporation. After the trial court held that respondents were entitled to a tax credit under Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 18001, appellant sought review. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that California rules governed the determination of the nature of the income and that those rules designated the stock in the corporation as the source of respondents' income. The court further held that California law utilized the mobilia sequuntur personam doctrine to locate the stock in California and that the one exception to the doctrine, being the business situs exception, was inapplicable. The court held that the income was derived in California and thus the tax credit provisions of &sect; 18001 could not be used.

Additionally, the court held that the time defendant spent in the custody of out-of-state authorities was attributable to his challenge to the extradition and not to the charges arising from the murders; thus, such time did not fall within the ambit of time served pursuant to &sect; 2900.5.

The court agreed that the ordinance did not impose any zoning or land use restrictions, it merely precluded respondent's participation in the convention center project. Appellants were still free to construct a convention center complex. Even if there were binding agreements, appellants could not prevent respondent from abandoning or rescinding plans to proceed, although the change in policy could result in liability for breach of contract. However, appellants did not allege a breach of contract. The court found that the order sustaining the demurrer was a correct decision on the merits of the case. Thus the court modified the judgment to declare that appellants were not entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order sustaining the demurrer was dismissed. The judgment as to the cause of action for declaratory relief was modified to declare that appellant corporations were not entitled to a determination that the initiative measure was invalid because the initiative did not impose zoning or land use restrictions and did not impair the obligation of contract. As modified, the judgment was affirmed and respondent city recovered costs on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant association entered into an agreement with respondents, commission and board, in which appellants agreed that it would forgo the power to strike. The agreement also contained police officers' bill of rights. Appellants went on strike and the mayor invoked his emergency powers and entered into an agreement with appellants to end the strike. Subsequently, respondents rescinded its approval of their agreement with appellants because they materially breached the agreement by striking. Appellants commenced an action to compel respondents to abide by the terms and conditions of the original agreement; the trial court denied appellants' request for relief. Appellants challenged the trial court's decision. The court reversed the trial court's judgment denying appellants' relief and directed the trial court to render a judgment for appellants. The court held that in accordance with Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 3505.1, once respondents approved the agreement it was binding on them. The court reasoned that although appellants' strike constituted a breach, the mayor's emergency agreement constituted an attempt to waive respondents' right to rescind the original agreement.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 1538.5 motion by respondent to suppress certain drug-related evidence with respect to the charge of heroin possession in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11350. Appellant contended that there was no evidence to support the finding that respondent was not in a public place of his own volition at the time of his arrest for being drunk in a public place. On appeal, the judgment of dismissal was reversed. In support of its ruling, the court held that the only issue in dispute was whether the building hallway in which respondent was arrested for being drunk in a public place, which resulted in the discovery of appellant's heroin, was a public place for statutory purposes. With respect to the instant case, the court noted that the hallway in question was, in fact, a public place as it was a location readily accessible to all those who wished to go there and because there were no locked gates or doors to keep the public from entering.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted defendant's motion for a new trial on the ground that the punitive damages award was excessive. Both parties appealed. The court reversed the order granting a new trial, holding that the order failed to make an adequate specification of reasons as required by Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 657. The court then determined that the punitive damage award was excessive and appeared to be the product of the jury's passion or prejudice. The court found that defendant's proposed instruction on punitive damages was properly rejected as it erroneously suggested that there was a fixed ratio between the punitive damages and the actual damages sustained. The court also reversed the judgment for plaintiff concluding that the proper course was to remand for a new trial on all issues where little purpose would be served by remanding for a trial upon the issue of damages alone.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sub-contractor appealed from a judgment against him in the Superior Court of Orange County (California). Plaintiff contended that Cal. Lab. Code &sect;&sect; 6304 and 6304.5 were unconstitutional and, alternatively, that &sect; 6304.5 should be strictly interpreted. Plaintiff also challenged the trial court's decisions as to the inclusion and exclusion of particular jury instructions on contributory negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sub-contractor was injured while working without a safety harness at a construction sight owned by defendant employer. The personal injury claim against defendant was defeated in a jury trial, and plaintiff appealed. Plaintiff attacked the constitutionality of Cal. Lab. Code &sect;&sect; 6304 and 6304.5, arguing that their subject matter was not sufficiently related to their stated purpose, violating Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect; 9, and that the legislature was unaware of the legal effect of the statutes, violating Rule 9 of the Joint Rules of the California Legislature. The court held that the statutes were sufficiently related to workmen's compensation to pass constitutional muster and that legislatures are presumed to know the effect of laws they enact. On the application of &sect; 6304.5, the court ruled that the admission of safety orders into evidence in third-party actions by an employee was forbidden. Plaintiff's objections to various jury instructions on contributory negligence were similarly discounted by the court, which held that the issue of negligence was adequately covered by the given instructions, which in turn were supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner fortune teller appealed a conviction from the appellate department of the superior court (California) for fortune telling and that affirmed the misdemeanor conviction as a violation of Los Angeles, Cal. Municipal Code &sect; 43.30.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner fortune teller claimed she was a high priestess of the religion Wicca as her defense to the charge of violating Los Angeles, Cal. Municipal Code &sect; 43.30, which made the business of fortune telling a misdemeanor. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that petitioner was engaged in the business when she advertised in the local newspaper and with business cards, readings took place in a commercial shop where numerous curios were on sale, and there was a sign over the cash register stating that tarot card readings were available for $ 10.00. Petitioner's religion did not require her to do fortune telling as a business, and the question of fees was not a tenet of her religion, therefore, the practice of the religion itself was not prohibited by the ordinance. Her constitutional right to freedom of speech was not violated by a prohibition against commercial enterprises deemed harmful to the public welfare. The fact that a state statute prohibited fraudulent fortune telling along with other fraudulent gaming devices was not indicative of state preemption of the field that prevented respondent from prohibiting the practice altogether.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed plaintiff fortune teller's misdemeanor conviction and dismissed her petition for writ of habeas corpus because the statute that criminalized fortune telling was not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, did not interfere with the practice of witchcraft, did not restrict her freedom of speech, and was not preempted by a state law that criminalized fraudulent fortune telling along with several fraudulent gaming devices.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied appellants pipe and refrigeration fitters' petition for a writ of mandamus to compel respondent city council to grant them a retroactive wage increase. The trial court held that because the wage increase was not being paid to private employees in the city on July 1, 1973 that respondent was powerless to grant appellants the wage increase retroactive to July 1, 1973. Appellants sought review. The court reversed, finding that respondent was required to adopt the salary amendment. The trial court's holding that respondent was powerless to retroactively increase appellants' rate of pay for the 1973-1974 fiscal year ignored the clear mandate of respondent's charter. The charter provided that when a rate of pay was paid in private industry and was certified by the civil service board, the city council had the duty to fix such rate of pay for groups engaged in the city service. The court concluded that there were no irreconcilable conflicts between the provisions of the code and the charter and the provisions could be harmonized to carry out the public policy of providing appellants the same wage rate received by comparable employees in private industry.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment denying the writ of mandate on the basis that respondent city council failed to follow the procedures authorized by its charter and code to insure appellants of their right to comparable wages with private employees which resulted in appellants receiving less than their counterparts in private industry for the 1973-1974 fiscal year.</SPAN></P>

Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 5116 was controlling over plaintiff's ordinances to the contrary, in favor of defendant California Department of Health. Plaintiff enacted a zoning ordinance which, if valid, would have precluded the location of a facility described in &sect; 5116 in an area zoned for single family residences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city was a chartered municipality within the meaning of Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5. It enacted a zoning ordinance containing a definition of single family dwelling that would have precluded the location of a facility described in Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 5116 in an area zoned for single family residences. Section 5116 provided that certain state facilities were to be considered a residential use for zoning purposes, and that such homes were a permitted use in all residential zones. Plaintiff sought a declaration that its zoning ordinance was valid despite the state statute. Both plaintiff and defendant California Department of Health moved for summary judgment. The trial court declared that city planning and zoning ordinances contrary to the state statute were invalid. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court concluded that &sect; 5116 was, by its terms, applicable to both chartered and general law cities, and that the statute was part of a statutory scheme of treatment of mentally ill and handicapped persons, which was of statewide concern. The court held that &sect; 5116 was meant to occupy the field to the exclusion of municipal regulation.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment holding that no vested right inured to appellant to proceed with development of a project that had no final approval and when commencement of work did not exist at the time of the adoption of the act. Appellant had to apply to respondent for a permit and, if the application was denied, then the desired buildings on the tract could not be constructed during the period the act was in effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer brought a class action seeking to prohibit the implementation of a strike settlement agreement pursuant to which defendant city had agreed to grant their policemen and firemen a raise in salary after the policemen and firemen commenced illegal strikes which resulted in almost a complete cessation of police and fire protection. Plaintiff alleged that defendant mayor wrongfully declared a state of emergency and that his approval to raise salaries was invalid because the city charter vested sole authority to fix salary rates in defendant's board of supervisors. The trial court rendered a judgment, which took judicial notice of the mayor's emergency proclamation, that a public emergency had existed, and that the emergency proclamation was valid. Both parties appealed. The court dismissed the purported appeal of defendant and affirmed the judgment finding that the trial court properly determined that any proof on an alleged improper motive on the part of the mayor was no basis for invalidating the mayor's actions and that the trial court could not consider whether or not legislation was the result of an illegal strike by public employees.</SPAN></P>

Affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that the trial court did not exceed its jurisdiction by making findings that differed slightly from those of respondent. The court found that appellant took a voluntary leave of absence for purely personal reasons, after being informed by her employer that a replacement would be hired and that she would be reemployed after the leave only if the replacement proved unsatisfactory.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A patient died after contracting serum hepatitis from a blood transfusion she received during a surgical procedure. Plaintiff, patient's husband, filed a wrongful death action against defendants, doctors, hospital, and nonprofit community blood bank, alleging causes of action in strict liability, breach of warranty, and negligence. The trial court sustained defendants' demurrers to the strict liability and breach of warranty causes of action. Plaintiff appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that strict liability should not have been applied to true services. Cal. Health &amp; Safety &sect; 1606 foreclosed the characterization of the transaction as a sale. The court found that blood injections and a ready availability of blood were absolutely vital to the medical profession's constant struggle against illness, injury, and disease. The court found that the legislature had weighed the relatively minor risk of hepatitis which the blood recipient must have taken, and had determined that in the absence of negligence, such risk must have been accepted.

The court also found that &sect; 1606 was in the area of economic regulation, and that it was clothed with a presumption of constitutionality. The court further held that &sect; 1606 had a reasonable relationship to a legitimate state purpose because the production and use of human blood for therapeutic purposes should have been encouraged, and that those who provided those products and were free of fault should not have suffered the economic loss that might otherwise be imposed under strict liability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for assault with a deadly weapon. Defendant argued that the crime became a misdemeanor when the trial court committed him to the youth authority and that Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 1770 providing for his discharge in two years or upon his 23rd birthday, whichever came later, was unconstitutional in that it restrained him of his liberty for longer than he would have been had he been committed to either jail or prison, and deprived him of equal protection of the laws, and constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that defendant was not committed to the youth authority for a term potentially longer than the maximum term of imprisonment which might have been imposed upon an adult committing the same offense and &sect; 1770 did not authorize the authority to maintain control over him in excess of the maximum term of imprisonment permitted by statute. Thus, the court perceived no violation of appellant's equal protection guarantees and his commitment, until he reached his 23rd birthday, was not cruel and unusual punishment. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed defendant's criminal prosecution for allowing unauthorized businesses to operate in his hotel in response to his demurrer to the complaint that was filed against him. The court reversed that dismissal on appeal, determining that Los Angeles Mun. Code &sect; 12.12 was only concerned with the use to which defendant could put his real property. The court further concluded that zoning ordinances had long been sustained as legitimate exercise of the police power, and that, as a hotel or apartment hotel, only incidental businesses that were conducted as a service to persons living therein were allowed. The court additionally held that the limitations imposed on defendant dealt with how he held himself out to the public, and not who could enter the premises to avail themselves of the goods or services offered. The court also reasoned that the true character of the business conducted by defendant had to be determined as a factual matter at the trial.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the decision of the trial court that denied appellant holiday pay. The court held that appellant was not entitled to compensation under &sect; 4850 for holiday pay not earned while on a disability leave of absence.

The court issued a writ directing the trial court to set aside its order sustaining the demurrer. The court held that &sect; 12312 punished possession of substances and materials only with the specific intent to make a destructive device or explosive. The court held that the statute did not punish innocent possession, but only possession that was an integral part of a person's specific intent to make a prohibited device.

Plaintiff, though listed as an unsecured creditor in the bankruptcy schedule, did not challenge the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction to discharge defendants' liability for the obligations of the limited partnership.

The case twice went to the U.S. Supreme Court, the first time being reversed and remanded. After the California Supreme Court decided a similar case regarding &sect; 311.2 in which it eventually ruled adversely to defendants' interests, the intermediate appeals court rejected appellants' argument that the evidence standard for obscenity in &sect; 311 was unconstitutional. The court found the standard to be utterly without redeeming social importance. The court concluded that materials were obscene when they were being commercially exploited for the sake of prurient appeal and the purveyors' sole interests were in the publications' provocative aspects. The court affirmed four of defendants' six adverse judgments and reversed two judgments against the clerk because merely packaging already purchased materials was not aiding and abetting a crime.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant challenged the trial court's denial of a subpoena duces tecum for all notes and reports produced by the corporate victim's private investigators that led to his prosecution, and all formulas and drawings related to 16 computer devices, allegedly to show the trade secrets involved were not truly secret. The court held that discovery could be had against a nonparty witness, but that defendant's requests amounted to a fishing expedition. Defendant's argument that the trade secret statute permitted a monopoly on unpatented technical developments was meritless, as the statute did not prohibit use of trade secrets gained honestly. The court confirmed the statute's constitutionality against defendant's assertion of vagueness, and upheld the statutory presumption that information is secret if its owner takes measures to protect it.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner alleged that the evidence obtained should have been suppressed. The court held that the search was illegal but not unconstitutional and denied the peremptory writ because the violation did not merit suppression of the evidence. The court held that the informant's conduct did not violate Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 5328 because the confidentiality provision related only to records and not to a drug purchase. The court then concluded that the federal statute,&nbsp;21 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1175, and its regulations, 42 C.F.R. &sect; 2.19, regarding confidentiality of drug abuse patient records, applied to the clinic, and found that the sheriff's department violated &sect; 2.19 when it instructed the informant to make a drug purchase from petitioner, but that such violation did not warrant suppression of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The proper standard for determining the sufficiency of such evidence was the clear and convincing standard, and the court found that there was ample evidence on the record to satisfy the standard.

Plaintiff appealed the trial court's judgment in favor of defendants, and the court affirmed the judgment. In determining preemption of the regulation by the state, the court looked to the pattern of legislation, the language used in the statutory provisions, and the nature of the subject matter. The court found nothing that indicated that the state intended the statutory provisions to preclude a more cautious use of deadly force by local police agencies than permitted by statute. The court was not persuaded that the regulation conflicted with state law, or that it actually subjected the officers to more restrictive standards than would apply to a private citizen effecting an arrest. The regulation in the police manual was reasonable and within the powers of defendant city manager to prescribe, was not in conflict with or preempted by state law, and did not deny constitutional rights to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The evidence supported respondent's contention that the construction was in accordance with the plan or design approved either by the city council or the appropriate employee.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which entered summary judgment in favor of defendant city.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city enacted an ordinance that prohibited the use of newsracks for the sale of material with any adult nudity. Plaintiff taxpayer filed a taxpayer's action for declaratory and injunctive relief and challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance. The trial court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment. The court reversed and held that the trial court focused on two subsections of the statute, one that prohibited the sale of &quot;harmful matter&quot; as defined in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 313, and one that prohibited any depiction of adult nudity. The court held that the &quot;harmful matter&quot; subsection of the ordinance was preempted by Cal. Penal Code &sect; 313.1 and, therefore, the subsection was invalid. The court held that the adult nudity subsection was a major incursion into constitutionally protected expression because it categorically prohibited nudity, which was not enough by itself to render material obscene.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This opinion decides four cases. In one case, petitioners, a medical director and the Department of Health, sought a writ of prohibition to prevent respondent Superior Court of San Bernardino County (California) from granting jury trials to mentally retarded persons involuntarily confined at a state hospital. In the other cases, petitioner mental patients sought release from custody via writs of habeas corpus, which were denied by respondent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four writ proceedings were decided in a consolidated opinion, each of which involved the issue of whether there was a right to jury trial in a habeas corpus proceeding brought by a person civilly committed as mentally retarded pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 6500 et seq. After issuing alternative writs in each case, the court first noted that Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 6500.1 provided that no allegedly mentally retarded person could be committed for a period of more than one year without a recommitment proceeding. The court then held that such persons were entitled, upon request, to a jury trial at their annual recommitment proceeding pursuant to &sect; 6500 et seq and that the right to a jury trial at that proceeding satisfied the allegedly mentally retarded persons' equal protection rights under the law. However, because there was no statutory basis for ordering jury trials in special habeas corpus proceedings under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect;&sect; 38120- 38121 or in traditional habeas corpus proceedings and because equal protection did not mandate it, the court concluded that such proceedings were to be decided without a jury.</SPAN></P>

Defendants were charged with and convicted of one count of conspiracy to murder and seven counts of first degree murder for which all defendants were sentenced to death.

The court reversed one defendant's conviction because her counsel's late entry into the case precluded counsel's impeaching witness credibility during closing argument or establishing a continuity of representation. The remaining defendants' convictions were affirmed. Evidence as to each defendant was sufficient under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1111 to corroborate an immunized witness' testimony and thereby support defendants' convictions. Defendants were properly precluded from testifying over their attorneys' objections because defendants refused to proffer their testimony outside of the jury's presence to prevent the introduction of inadmissible evidence. Extensive publicity did not deprive defendants of a fair trial because there was no evidence to support the finding under either a presumptive prejudice or totality of the circumstances standard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state charged defendant with possession of materials with the intent to make explosive or destructive devices in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12312. The indictment alleged that defendant had possessed a substance, material, and combination of substances and materials with the intent to make a destructive device and explosive. The trial court sustained a demurrer by defendant on the basis that the words &quot;substance&quot; and &quot;material&quot; were too vague effectively to give defendant notice of the charge against her. On appeal, the court reversed the order sustaining the demurrer. The court held that the count charging violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12312 used the exact language of the statute and referred specifically to the section. The transcript of the testimony before the grand jury provided abundant specific identification of the materials and substances alleged to have been in the possession of defendant. Defendant was given notice. Where punishment imposed was only for an act knowingly done with the purpose of doing that which the statute prohibited, defendant could not be said to suffer from lack of warning or knowledge that the act which she committed was a violation of law.</SPAN></P>

The lower court granted summary judgment in favor of respondent. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment in favor of respondent, holding that there was no constitutional violation by respondent when it inspected appellant's premises to check for appropriate permits. The court found that by operating vending machines, even if limited to the use by occupants and guests of the apartment house, appellant was carrying on a vending machine business and became liable to inspection under the city ordinance.

The court held that the service upon appellant of a notice to quit the premises, without more, did not implicate a state action that would give appellant constitutional protection from eviction for exercising her right to speech. Additionally, the court held that, absent an unlawful detainer action, respondents' efforts to evict appellant did not implicate a state action that would render them liable under the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction and sentence from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) for first degree murder. Defendant asserted that the evidence did not support his conviction, and that the trial court erroneously concluded that he was ineligible for sentencing as a youthful offender under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1202b.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder. The court affirmed the adjudication of guilt, but vacated the sentence. First, the court held that the evidence was more than adequate to support the conviction. The court rejected defendant's assertion that he entered the premises out of curiosity, rather than with the intent to commit a felony, and that he was under the influence of alcohol and drugs. While the evidence argued might have persuaded the trial court to have a reasonable doubt concerning defendant's intent at the time he entered the premises and his capacity to harbor any such intent, it was not compelling. Next, the trial court erred when it ruled that it had no discretion to sentence defendant as a youthful offender under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1202b, because the last sentence of that section was inapplicable because no special circumstances were alleged and the only punishment faced by defendant was life imprisonment. Thus, the court remanded for resentencing under &sect; 1202b.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's adjudication of guilt, and held that the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction for first degree murder. However, the court vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing. The court held that the trial court erred when it concluded that it could not sentence defendant as a youthful offender because the only punishment defendant faced was life imprisonment, and not death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff debtor agreed to buy furniture from a private party and assume the debt, but an assign-and-assume form was never executed. Defendant creditor added plaintiff's name to the account and assigned it to a collection agency, which sued plaintiff. The municipal court found for plaintiff, who then filed a malicious prosecution and wrongful attachment action against defendant and the collection agency. The jury awarded plaintiff compensatory and punitive damages. On appeal, the court affirmed after it modified the amount of punitive damages because the award was excessive. The evidence supported the elements of malicious prosecution because defendant had the right to control the collection agency and malice in fact was inferred from the lack of probable cause. The lack was shown by the fact that the collection manager who assigned the account had authority to bind defendant and the assignment was without any reasonable or sincere belief that plaintiff was a debtor of defendant. Plaintiff's showing in opposition to defendant's motion to dismiss was not entirely absent of any showing that constituted good cause for delay and did not mandate a finding of abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

He petitioned for workers compensation, but was denied. On appeal, the court found that no case had held that prisoners comprised a suspect class nor had the right to receive workmen's compensation. Hence, the strict scrutiny analysis was not applicable to the denial of workmen's compensation to prisoners. Because there was a rational basis for the distinction between state prisoners and other persons deemed public employees, the court held that the statutory provisions disallowing the payment of compensation to a state prisoner during the period of his incarceration were constitutional.

Respondents filed a motion for summary judgment asserting that the lien was void because Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 537 was unconstitutional. Respondents also asserted that the lien applied only to the seller's interest because equitable title had passed prior to the attachment. The trial court granted respondents' motion finding the attachment void because of the unconstitutional nature of section 537. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the case. According to the court, the trial court erred by retroactively applying the ruling that all prejudgment attachments under section 537 were void. The court held that while section 537 was found to be unconstitutional, it did not mean that all prejudgment attachments that had ripened into a judgment lien were invalid. The court stated that the nullity rule of prejudgment attachments did not apply retroactively so as to nullify prior attachment procedures which culminated in judgment liens.

Appellant then filed an action for declaratory relief against respondent insured and his children and sought a judicial determination that it did not have to cover the liability of the insured. The lower court entered judgment in respondents' favor. On appeal, the court reversed. The court reasoned that the exclusion was not ambiguous and that the statute authorizing the exclusion, Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, owner of student housing, sought damages from defendant surety company because of latent defects in the design and construction of the apartments. The trial court granted summary judgment to defendant under the provisions of Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 337.15, which prescribed a 10-year period of limitation for an action to recover damages for latent deficiency. Plaintiff appealed, contending that &sect; 337.15 was inapplicable because the statute by its terms did not expressly include causes of action that had accrued prior to its effective date, because application of the statute failed to allow plaintiff a reasonable time within which to sue, and because the obligation of defendant on its bond is severable and independent. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, finding that &sect; 337.15 was applicable and noted that the only effect of the statute was to shorten the time in which the cause of action could be asserted. The court, rejecting the attack on the constitutionality of the statute, stated that &sect; 337.15 was controlling because, although the action pleaded was not barred under prior law, the action was not brought until &sect; 337.15 was in effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision, finding that the statute prescribing a 10-year period of limitation for an action to recover damages for latent deficiency in the design or construction of the property was applicable. The court stated that the action that was pleaded was not barred under prior law, but the action was not filed prior to the effective date of the new statute and therefore, the new statute was applicable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners filed an inverse condemnation action against respondent county, asserting that the rezoning of their property was for the purpose of acquiring open space and that the effect of the ordinance constituted was a taking for which compensation was due. At no time did appellants indicate that they wished to amend the complaint. The trial court sustained the respondent's demurrer without leave to amend. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that appellants failed to allege precondemnation activities, or the lack of any remaining reasonable beneficial use, or any public use of their property, as required for consideration of the relief requested. There was no set formula to determine where regulation ended and taking began. A cause of action for inverse condemnation would not lie where there was a mere reduction in the value of property resulting from a zoning ordinance, as there was not a compensable injury. The purpose or motive of the city officials in passing the ordinance was irrelevant to any inquiry concerning the reasonableness of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs conceded that their nuisance claim rested solely upon alleged negligence with respect to the design of the bridge. Immunity granted by the Act could not be avoided by pleading a cause of action in nuisance rather than in negligence. The Act was a specific statute regulating the tort liabilities and immunities of public entities while the nuisance statute,&nbsp;Cal. Civ.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, prison inmate, challenged decision approving adoption of his minor son by respondent, the boy's stepfather. The trial court found that for more than one year, appellant willfully failed to pay for child support when able to do so; therefore, appellant's consent to adoption was unnecessary under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 224. Appellant argued &sect; 224 denied him equal protection of the law. On appeal, the court reversed. The notion that men were more likely than women to be the primary supporters of their spouses and children was not without empirical support. A statute designed to cushion the financial impact of spousal loss upon the sex for which that loss imposed a disproportionately heavy burden could survive an equal protection attack. Appellant argued that his failure to pay for his son's care, support and education was not &quot;willful&quot; under &sect; 224. The court held that a father who was unable to comply with an order for the payment of child support could not be adjudged in contempt for such noncompliance unless he had voluntarily created the disability for the purpose of avoiding payment. Appellant's failure to make child support payments was not &quot;willful.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant fathers were separately charged in the municipal court with violating Cal.

The superior court denied the writs, and appellants sought review. The matters were consolidated on appeal. The court reversed, and the superior court was directed to issue the writs. Section 270, from the time of its enactment in 1872 until it was amended in 1923, made no distinctions between mothers and fathers, and treated parents of minor children equally. The 1974 amendment to the section again made its provisions declaring it unlawful to willfully fail to support a minor child equally applicable to both parents. Section 270, before its amendment in 1974, unconstitutionally discriminated on its face against fathers of minor children as a class. Appellants, as members of the class discriminated against, were entitled to dismissal of the criminal charges.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment, holding that in view of the statutory definition contained in Cal. Ins.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the day of defendant's trial on several charges of grand theft and forgery, the trial court allegedly engaged in sentencing negotiations with defendant in return for a conditional plea. The prosecutor objected to the trial court's order on the grounds his consent was required pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1192.5. The trial court disregarded the objection and entered the sentencing order. The state petitioned for a writ of review, prohibition or mandate. The court granted the writ of mandate. The court held that under the separation of powers doctrine the trial court had no authority to substitute itself as the representative of the state in the negotiation process and under the guise of &quot;plea bargaining&quot; to &quot;agree&quot; to disposition of a case over prosecutorial objection. A trial court could not offer any inducement in return for a plea of guilty or nolo contendere. Because it was not clear from the record whether the trial court actually engaged in plea negotiations or was simply exercising its sentencing discretion, the matter was remanded for rehearing on defendant's conditional plea.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained defendants' demurrer, and plaintiff appealed. The court reversed and remanded with direction to enter a judgment for plaintiff. The court applied a strict scrutiny analysis to &sect; 1264 because it established suspect classifications. For its legality to be sustained, defendants had to show a compelling state interest which necessitated the distinction. A seemingly neutral statute which disqualified a disproportionate number of one sex was discriminatory and vulnerable to the strict scrutiny test; it was enough if statistics showed that the standard affected women only. Absent a showing of a compelling state interest, defendants failed to show that &sect; 1264 was not an invalid denial of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected appellants' argument that because the redevelopment agency did not function for a period of seven years after the city council declared a need for such an agency through an ordinance, the city's legislative body was permitted to declare by ordinance that the agency was no longer needed.

The trial court entered summary judgment directing the removal of all billboards and declaring that defendant was not entitled to compensation for four of the billboards. Although rejecting defendant's argument that a statute providing for compensation after, rather than before, removal violated Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 19, the court reversed the summary judgment because the affidavits submitted by the parties in support of and opposition to summary judgment created triable issues of fact as to whether defendant's billboards were in fact subject to mandatory removal under the Act and, if so, whether defendant was entitled to compensation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sellers filed an action for fraud, alleging overpersuasion by defendant buyer in the sale of plaintiffs' farm. The jury found in favor of plaintiffs, and the trial court denied defendant's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and motion for a new trial. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that defendant's appeal was timely, because it was within 60 days of the mailing of the notice of the denial of defendant's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. There was no waiver by plaintiffs of fraud, even though after discovery of the fraud they entered into a new contract concerning the same subject matter. This would normally constitute a waiver of the original fraud, but here the act of entering into the second contract was itself induced by defendant's fraud. It was proper to instruct the jury on the right to use and the right to profit from the land, because the contract itself created these rights. Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3343 (a) 2 and (a)(3) were neither unconstitutionally vague nor uncertain. The damages awarded were well within the allowable additional figure and the award of punitive damages was permissible under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3343.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that, in the baseness of crimes involving drug traffic, the sale or furnishing of drugs to minors ranked at the very top. The court did not find that the 10-year minimum sentence was cruel or unusual; the only cruelty the court detected was that inflicted upon the minor victim when heroin was made available for his use. The difference in minimum prison time between a Cal.

She requested and received a jury trial to determine whether or not she was a narcotic addict under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 3108. She requested and was denied a jury instruction that the jury had to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that she was a narcotic addict and that any such finding must be unanimous. The trial court instructed the jury according to the provisions of &sect; 3108 that the finding had to be by a preponderance of the evidence and signed by nine or more jurors. Eleven of twelve jurors decided that appellant was a narcotic addict, and she was committed to the California Rehabilitation Center (CRC). On appeal, the court reversed, holding that &sect; 3108&nbsp;unconstitutionally deprived appellant of due process of law. The court found that CRC commitment sometimes resulted in longer curtailment of personal freedom than that which occurred following many criminal convictions and that trial judges often regarded CRC commitment as the harsher penalty. The court held that a jury had to unanimously find beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was a narcotic addict, and declared &sect; 3108 to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city enacted zoning ordinances that classified plaintiff landowners' property as open space and conservation lands. In inverse condemnation actions for damages, plaintiffs contended that the ordinances denied them any substantial or reasonable use of their property. The trial court sustained defendant's general demurrers, holding that no cause of action was stated. Plaintiffs appealed the judgments of dismissal. The court observed that a valid zoning ordinance may operate so oppressively as to amount to a taking, thus giving an aggrieved landowner a right to damages in inverse condemnation. The court found that determining whether a zoning restriction was so arbitrary and unreasonable to constitutionally require compensation was a question of fact that could not properly be resolved by demurrer. The court rejected defendant's claim that plaintiffs failed to exhaust administrative remedies, finding that applying for variances with the amount of land involved was useless. Reversing the judgments of dismissal, the court held that plaintiffs stated a cause of action for damages in inverse condemnation and directed the orders sustaining the demurrers be set aside.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, mentally ill patients and their doctors, sought a writ for peremptory mandate from a California trial court to prevent respondents, attorney general, health director, and board of medical examiners, from enforcing amendments made to the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, mentally ill patients and their doctors, were possibly in need of voluntary treatments of electroconvulsive therapy and psychosurgery. The Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 5000- 5404 changed the conditions under which psychosurgery and shock treatment could be performed. Petitioners asserted the changes were unconstitutional in certain respects and filed a peremptory writ of mandate permanently preventing respondents, attorney general, health director, and board of medical examiners, from enforcing the amendments. Petitioners alleged the amendments denied equal protection because of unreasonable classifications of mental patients and violated substantive and procedural due process because the patient's constitutional rights of privacy, freedom of thought, and access to adequate medical treatment were infringed upon without adequate procedural safeguards or sufficient relation to a compelling state interest. The court issued a peremptory writ of mandate finding that various provisions of &sect; 5000 et seq. were unconstitutional for vagueness and thus invalid.</SPAN></P>

The trial court decided that the disclaimer executed by appellant did not satisfy the requirements of Cal. Prob. Code &sect;&sect; 190(c), and 190.6 and was not a legally valid disclaimer. Appellant argued on appeal that Cal. Prob. Code &sect; 190.9 was intended to protect creditors and bona fide purchasers of a beneficiary who might disclaim his interest but not the state's intervening right to inheritance taxes. The court held that inheritance taxes are vested and determined in accordance with the law in effect on the date of transfer or death and that rights so fixed cannot be surrendered, diminished or impaired by subsequent action of the Legislature since to do so would constitute a gift of public funds in violation of the state Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of giving and offering to give a bribe to an executive officer, with the intent of influencing his acts, decisions and opinion under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 67. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the term &quot;executive officer&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague and that the county coroner qualified as an &quot;executive officer&quot; based on his discretionary powers and his executive co-position as sheriff. Further, defendant had no constitutional right to counsel at the pre-arraignment stage, and the admission of the tape recordings into evidence was proper under federal and state law under the one-party rule, since the agent and coroner consented to the tapings. Finally, the evidence sufficiently supported the jury's finding that the criminal intent to commit the bribery originated in the mind of defendant, not the agent's or coroner's, and thus, there was no unlawful entrapment.</SPAN></P>

I, did not protect obscenity and that &sect; 311.2, was not unconstitutionally vague or violative of freedom of speech. The court held that an injunction was not permitted to prevent the execution of a public statute, by officers of the law, for the public benefit because Cal.  Code Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county held a referendum regarding a rezoning ordinance passed by the board of supervisors that permitted defendant corporation to construct oil and gas facilities on coastal property. Plaintiff citizens contested the vote approving the ordinance. Defendants filed motions for summary judgment with declarations establishing that votes cast in the challenged precincts were overwhelmingly against the proposition, that if all disqualified ballots were counted against the proposition, it still prevailed, and that statements asserted to constitute improper influence to vote in favor of the proposition were included in environmental impact data gathered by the county and in the official voter information pamphlet. Plaintiffs challenged summary judgment granted in favor of defendants. The court held that because of inherent inconsistency between the procedural requirements of summary judgment under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 437c, and the statutory scheme governing election contests, Cal. Elec. Code &sect; 20020 et seq., summary judgment was not an available remedy. Therefore, the judgment was reversed, and the court made several conclusions to guide the trial court on remand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment granted in favor of defendants, county and corporation, because summary judgment conflicted with the statutory scheme of election contests thus making it an improper remedy.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the convictions and concluded that the evidence barred by Cal. Evid.

Policy considerations dictated that the evidence be excluded, and those policy considerations were deemed incorporated within the definition of a fair trial.  Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 352 empowered the trial judge to bar impeachment of a witness by reference to collateral testimony from the preliminary hearing.  Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 782's requirement of an offer of proof that evidence of sexual conduct was relevant and admissible and could not have tended to incriminate appellant. The evidence offered at the preliminary hearing that the victim was forcibly moved a substantial distance was sufficient to hold appellant for trial on kidnapping.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent superior court issued a peremptory writ of prohibition directing the municipal court not to proceed with the prosecution of real parties in interest, women charged with violations of Cal.

Respondent based its decision on evidence showing the manner of enforcement by the police department and statistics showing the great imbalance in arrests of women as opposed to men under &sect; 647(b). The state sought an extraordinary writ preventing respondent from enforcing its order. The court held &sect; 647(b), was fair on its face and impartial and by its terms applied to every person who solicits or who engages in any act of prostitution and further that real parties established that the prosecuting authorities, in administering the statute, had followed an enforcement pattern deliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard, and that a denial of equal protection had been demonstrated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Marin Municipal Water District adopted a resolution, finding that water consumption was outpacing water capacity in the district, and declared a water shortage emergency. Plaintiff landowner, who had already obtained approval of his plans and a building permit, applied for a pipeline extension to bring water to the home he planned to build in the district. Defendant then amended the water code to provide that no new water service would be granted or installed, and rejected plaintiff's application. Plaintiff filed for a writ of mandate to compel defendant to grant him water service, which the trial court granted. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that because defendant had acted in a legislative, rather than adjudicatory, capacity in enacting the moratorium on new water service, its actions were subject to a limited review. The court held that defendant did not act fraudulently, arbitrarily or capriciously in declaring a water shortage emergency condition to exist and in enacting a water moratorium on new water service connections; hence, the trial court exceeded the limited scope of its review in granting plaintiff the writ of mandate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, alleged prostitutes, were dissatisfied with the judge who had been assigned to their case and sought to disqualify him from hearing it. The court held that the assertion of the judge that petitioners lacked standing to exercise a challenge against him was incorrect. The court disagreed that Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 170.6 only applied to contested issues of law, since the statute also clearly applied to issues of fact. The court also opined that the statute had been widely abused to keep judges out of certain courts, but that the proper way to challenge the judge was on appeal., where the matters could be reviewed and corrected. The court held that the wholesale challenge of a particular judge, on all cases of a particular type, effectively prevented that judge from hearing any cases of that type and was an unwarranted interference with the powers of the court. The court concluded that the judge did not err when he rejected the challenge, even though his reasons were not sound, since his action could be upheld if it was correct on another basis. The writ was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant board of administration appealed the decision of the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), granting plaintiff employee certain disability retirement benefits. Defendant claimed that plaintiff did not acquire vested rights to a disability pension until he was actually disabled and thus he was not entitled to the larger disability pension to which he would have been entitled had the law not changed 23 days before his injury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee worked for the California Department of Corrections as a plumber-foreman for over five years. He was injured on the job and incapacitated by the injury. His injury occurred 23 days after the effective date of legislative changes that defendant administrative board argued resulted in a diminution of the disability benefits to which he was entitled from $ 475 to $ 90 per month. Plaintiff petitioned the trial court for writ of mandate seeking review of the defendant's decision. The trial court directed defendant to pay plaintiff the greater benefits. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that plaintiff acquired a vested contractual right to a reasonable disability retirement pension when he entered upon performance of his employment contract. The court held further that the validity of attempted changes in plaintiff's pension rights was dependent upon any resulting disadvantage being offset by comparable new advantages. Because that was not the case where one formula resulted in the possibility of self-support and the other did not, plaintiff was entitled to the benefits requested.</SPAN></P>

The court held that plaintiff had a vested right in the disability benefits and that any modification of the benefits to his disadvantage had to be offset by a comparable new advantage.</SPAN></P>

The court held that petitioners could not amend their complaint because only those persons whose cause of action for loss of consortium arose within one year prior to decision allowing consortium claims could amend their complaint. The court held that petitioners attempted to state an entirely different cause of action, which defeated amendment of complaint. Pursuant to Cal.

I, U.S. Const. amend. VII, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court held that the facts of appellant's crime revealed a violent, malicious, and unprovoked assault with a knife upon a correctional officer, resulting in a serious injury; that &sect; 4500 contained a rational gradation in punishment based on the injury to the victim; and that there were penological purposes for the punishment. The court held defendant was not being punished for his status as a life prisoner, but rather his acts in committing the crimes. The court held that compared to similar statutes in other states, the punishment was lenient.

Plaintiff was unaware of the settlement with the creditors. On learning of the facts after her husband's death, she demanded of defendant the proceeds of the stock sale and thereafter filed this action. The court held that decedent's interest in the stock plan was community property under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 5110. Further, at the time defendant sold the stock and decedent distributed it to his creditors, Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 5105 vested the power of management and control of the community property in the husband. The court held that decedent's debts were properly settled out of the proceeds of the stock plan. The court noted that defendant owed no fiduciary duty to plaintiff, nor that it was in any way a trustee of either an express or implied trust of which she was a beneficiary.

The court affirmed the denial of the motion for a new trial. The court determined that respondent was under no duty to disclose the proposed use and that any project enhancement evidence was inadmissible. The court held that the lower court correctly determined the highest and best use of appellant's property because redevelopment and rezoning were improbable, and, therefore, the denial of appellant's motion for a new trial was proper.

The court had initially held that the original enabling legislation was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff judge was the incumbent judge of a justice court. The legislature authorized defendant, the Board of Supervisors of San Joaquin County, to consolidate two contiguous judicial districts into a single municipal court district consisting of two divisions. Plaintiff, a nonlawyer, could not serve as a municipal court judge. He challenged the constitutionality of the legislation creating the municipal court. The trial court granted defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. That decision was initially reversed on appeal to the court. Thereafter, the legislature enacted a new enabling statute, which created a unified district with no divisions. The court subsequently reversed its earlier decision. The court held that the new statute rendered the appeal moot because it now questioned the constitutionality of repealed legislation. Moreover, the court noted that the abolishment of plaintiff's office by the legislature failed to offend the constitutional rights of plaintiff or the public. The court further held plaintiff could not seek the difference between a clerk's salary, his new position, and a judge's salary because that issue was not before the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed its earlier decision and held that a new enabling statute, enacted after the court's initial decision, rendered plaintiff judge's appeal of his action, which challenged the constitutionality of legislation that abolished a justice court and created a new municipal court, moot. The trial court was directed to dismiss plaintiff's complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant applicant sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Contra Costa County (California), which denied a writ of mandate sought to compel respondent employers, a community college, to employ appellant without requiring her to take and subscribe to an oath swearing to uphold the United States and California Constitutions. Appellant contended that the oath would infringe her rights under U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant applicant sought a writ of mandate to compel respondent employers to employ her as a cafeteria worker at a state college without being required to take an oath to uphold the United States and California Constitutions. Appellant contended that by requiring her to sign the oath as a condition of employment, respondents were requiring her to surrender her rights under U.S. Const. amend. I by bringing into effect Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 3109, which made it a crime for anyone who had taken the oath to join an organization that advocated overthrow of the government. The trial court denied the requested relief on the ground that appellant's cause was not ripe for review, as she did not allege that she ever intended to join a subversive organization and, therefore, &sect; 3109 was not implicated. Appellant challenged the decision. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, finding that, although the trial court's reasoning for denial of the writ was flawed, the judgment would be upheld because part of the oath in question had already been declared unconstitutional, and thus appellant could not be prosecuted under &sect; 3109, even if she were to later advocate overthrow of the government.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, finding that part of the oath appellant applicant was required to take had been previously declared unconstitutional, thus precluding prosecution under the relevant statute. Accordingly, the court determined that appellant could be compelled to take the oath as a condition of employment because she did not risk later prosecution under the statute for exercise of her First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent publishers were charged by a complaint with the publication of criminal libel in violation of former Cal.

Penal Code &sect;&sect; 248- 257, were unconstitutional. Upon respondent court's grant of the writ the people sought review. On review, the court affirmed. The court first noted that although respondent publishers were only charged under &sect; 249, the entire scheme was required to be examined to ensure that any voided provisions of the scheme did not taint the remainder. The court held that &sect; 250 was unconstitutional because it presumed malice, which was one of the elements of the crime. The court held &sect; 251&nbsp;unconstitutional because it impermissibly limited the defense of truth. The court held that &sect;&sect; 248, 249 were unconstitutional because they relied upon impermissible definitions and further, with the striking of &sect;&sect; 250, 251, no guidelines remained to assist in interpreting the statute as to truth or falsity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed respondent court's writ of prohibition as sought by respondent publishers, because the writ properly found that California's criminal libel statutory scheme was constitutionally infirm as it presumed malice, an element of the crime, impermissibly limited the defense of truth, and the remaining statutes could not stand alone given the unconstitutionality of the other statutes in the scheme.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs' subcontractors failed to pay prevailing wages and plaintiffs became contractually liable to pay the penalty to the state as well as to pay the wronged workmen the difference in wages. Plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of the statute's disparate treatment to government contracts and the penalties. The court affirmed because there was a rational basis for the legislature to treat public contracts differently from private contracts, and Cal. Lab.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, appealed a judgment of a California superior court, which found him guilty of robbery in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 211, murder in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187, and using a firearm in the offenses in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022.5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, challenged a juvenile court's decision to try him as an adult, and his convictions. Defendant also argued that during his criminal trial improper evidence was introduced, namely, a pistol, a nylon stocking mask, and photographs. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of conviction and held that the order of the juvenile court under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 707 that declared defendant unfit, was not one of those listed in Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 800, which was the sole statutory authority for appeal from a juvenile court order. The court found that a juvenile dissatisfied with the ruling of the juvenile court was not free to await the decision on the criminal charges before seeking a review of the juvenile court proceeding. At trial, defendant did not voice an objection to the items of evidence when offered for identification. When they were offered, defendant's attorney simply objected without stating a basis for the objection. The court found ample evidence of defendant's guilt. The evidence established defendant's identity, the nature of the murder and the robbery charged, and the weapons were discovered during defendant's arrest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), which issued a writ prohibiting the municipal court from entertaining criminal charges against defendant for accosting another in a public place for the purpose of begging or soliciting for alms in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect;647 (c) and soliciting contributions for a charitable purpose without a permit in violation of Oakland, Cal., Mun. Code &sect; 3-2.09.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for violation of Cal.

Code &sect; 3-2.09 (soliciting contributions for a charitable purpose without a permit) while engaged in soliciting funds. The purpose of the solicitation was a factual issue. The superior court issued a writ prohibiting the municipal court from entertaining the charges against defendant, holding that depending on the definition of &quot;accost,&quot; &sect; 647(c) was either invalid on U.S. Const. amend I grounds or it was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite as to what conduct it prohibited. The state appealed with regard to the constitutionality of &sect; 647(c) but not with regard to the constitutionality of the municipal ordinance. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that &sect; 647(c) did not impinge on freedoms guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. I or Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, regardless of which definition of &quot;accost&quot; was used. The court also held that the meaning of the statute was sufficiently clear to give warning of the conduct that was proscribed and was thus not unconstitutional on vagueness grounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon the petition of respondent prisoner, the trial court issued a writ of habeas corpus which declared a prisoner mail regulation to be constitutionally invalid and dictated the exact language of an amendment to be enacted by appellant director of corrections in order to render the regulation constitutional.

At trial, defendants filed motions to suppress evidence under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1538.5. The trial court denied defendants' motions and defendants appealed. The court affirmed, finding that the search warrant pursuant to which the obscene materials were seized was valid. The court rejected the argument that the magistrate should have personally viewed the films prior to issuing the warrant, finding that probable cause existed that the films were pornographic without viewing them. The court also found that the police officers' initial entry onto defendants' premises was lawful, although entry was arranged to investigate a possible forged check charge, since there was no intent to search the premises at that time. Defendants' assertion that the police officers seized property before they obtained a search warrant, because two officers were left in control of the location, was also rejected by the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed from the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), which dismissed their action against defendant insurer by granting defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, and denying plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs' action sought payment of a judgment previously obtained against defendant's insured resulting from an airplane accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' decedent was killed in an airplane crash and plaintiffs obtained a judgment against the estate of the pilot. In this action, plaintiffs sought to recover under a general liability policy covering the airplane. The policy contained an explicit exclusion of liability for injuries to occupants of the airplane, which was permitted by Cal. Pub. Util. Code &sect; 21406 (repealed 1973). Plaintiffs sought to recover under the policy because that statute was subsequently repealed and was declared unconstitutional. The trial court granted defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings and denied plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs appealed and the court affirmed, based on the unambiguous language of the policy exclusion. The court distinguished these facts from a case in which a policy insured against any liability imposed by law, which was then broadened by a change in the law. In this case, the language of the policy imposed the limitation on liability and the contract provision was not changed by the change in the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the Superior Court of Butte County (California), which sentenced him to life imprisonment without parole after a conviction of kidnaping for robbery with bodily harm.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of kidnaping for robbery with bodily harm and lesser offenses of robbery in the first degree, and assault to rob. Because all of the offenses involved the same victim and were part of the same transaction, the trial court ordered the sentences for the lesser offenses suspended. The court rejected defendant's claims of cruel and unusual punishment under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, and denial of equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, finding no abuse of discretion at the lower court level for the life imprisonment sentence. After considering the penological and social objectives of the challenged punishment in the light of the evil to which that punishment was directed, the court concluded that the penalty of life imprisonment without parole was not clearly, positively, or unmistakably disproportionate to the offense of kidnaping for robbery with bodily harm. The court affirmed the judgment, but modified the sentence to include a stay of sentences for the lesser offenses, instead of a suspension, until defendant had served the sentence for kidnaping for robbery with bodily harm.</SPAN></P>

Health and Safety Code &sect;&sect; 11352 and 11360. Alleging the systematic exclusion of women from the grand jury, both defendants moved to quash the indictment. The trial court granted the motion for defendant female because she was a member of the class underrepresented on the grand jury; however because defendant male was not a member of the class the court held that he had failed to show any bias to him from such underrepresentation. Plaintiff state appealed the trial court's ruling as to defendant female, and defendant male filed a petition for writ of prohibition. The court vacated and set aside the trial court judgment quashing the indictment against defendant female, with directions to reinstate criminal proceedings; defendant male's petition for writ was denied. Although the court held that women were sufficiently numerous and distinct from men and when systematically eliminated from jury panels, the fair-cross-section requirement of U.S. Const. amend. VI was violated, application of this principal could not be retroactively applied.</SPAN></P>

In upholding the lower court's ruling, the court also noted that plaintiff's partial payment of taxes under protest, with no payment of the tax balance, did not entitle plaintiff to an action for redress.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of pandering in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 266i. The statute condemns, among other things, the inducement, persuasion, or encouragement of a female to become a prostitute. An officer represented herself to be a model. Defendant asked for a telephone number that he would provide to clients of the Japan Travel Bureau that desired to obtain her services as a prostitute. According to defendant's proposal, the officer would have sex with Japanese tourists. Defendant's interest in the plan was not the receipt of any remuneration but rather the satisfaction of the travel agency's clientele by augmenting the usual services that were offered. The court affirmed because the absence of financial gain was not fatal to the conviction because the statute covered all ramifications of the evil of the crime. The court found that the evidence supported the conviction and that the statute was not vague or overbroad because the statute was not susceptible to being interpreted to cover any activity beyond that of pandering and defendant's conduct met the commonly accepted definitions of the words of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order from the Superior Court of Santa Cruz County (California), which denied appellant's petition for a peremptory writ of mandate to restrain respondent municipal court from proceeding in a criminal action against appellant for violation of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 2141.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with violating Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 2141 for holding herself out to treat and treating a woman in childbirth without a valid license. Appellant sought a peremptory writ of mandate to restrain respondent municipal court from proceeding with the criminal charges on the grounds that &sect; 2141 was unconstitutional because of overbreadth and vagueness. The trial court denied appellant's petition and overruled her demurrer. Appellant sought review and the court reversed and held that Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 2141 was neither vague nor overbroad, but that the complaint against appellant did not properly seek to apply the provisions of &sect; 2141 to appellant's actions, that pregnancy and childbirth was not an ailment or disease, and that at the time of appellant's alleged conduct, there was no prohibition in the law to unlicensed childbirth assistance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and directed the trial court to issue the peremptory writ of mandate because although the statute under which appellant was arrested was neither vague nor overbroad, the complaint against appellant did not properly seek to apply the statute to appellant's actions, and pregnancy and childbirth was not an ailment or disease, and unlicensed childbirth assistance was not prohibited at the time of appellant's arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Contra Costa County (California) finding that Cal. Water Code &sect; 50704 was unconstitutional, because it apportioned votes in district elections on the value of land in the district as determined from the equalized tax roll of the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, who was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the office of the trustee of the water reclamation district, argued that defendant received more votes than he did because the election was conducted in compliance with Cal. Water Code &sect; 50704. He filed an election contest. The trial court held that the provisions of &sect; 50704 that apportioned votes in district elections on the value of land in the district as determined from the equalized tax roll of the county was constitutionally impermissible. The court held that &sect; 50704 did not violate the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. Because the evaluation and the determination of the value of benefits derived from reclamation was made by valuation commissioners and the board of supervisors, not the trustees, the legislative decision was reasonable, rational, and necessary to further a compelling state interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment finding that the water code violated the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment was reversed because the legislation was reasonable, rational, and necessary to further a compelling state interest. Plaintiff's successful election contest was therefore overturned.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon petition by appellant state officials, the court granted a rehearing of its previous order affirming a judgment of the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), which enjoined the closure of state offices on Good Friday and the payment for time taken off from work during the period and which awarded attorneys' fees and costs to respondent employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found in favor of respondent employee and enjoined the governor from ordering state offices to be closed and from paying workers for the period of noon to three p.m. on Good Friday, finding the practice violative of the Establishment Clause, U.S. Const. amend. I, and Cal. Const. art. 1, &sect; 4. On appeal, the court initially affirmed but granted appellant state officials a rehearing. The court again affirmed, holding that the governor's closure of state offices for the identical three-hour period designated as a &quot;holiday&quot; in Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 6700(l) could not be ascribed to coincidence or executive caprice; it unmistakably indicated that his purpose was to give practical effect to that statute and as to state employees. The court held that because it wholly lacked any &quot;secular purpose,&quot; the governor's order failed the first aspect of the tripartite test of the Establishment Clause. This failure alone was conclusive of its unconstitutionality, but the governor's order failed the other two aspects of the test as well. The court held that because the conclusion was absolutely necessary to a disposition of the appeal, &sect; 6700(l) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of respondent employee, holding that the Good Friday order did not reflect a clearly secular purpose because it was a religious day rooted in Christian theology, its primary effect was one which advances religion, and excessive government entanglement with religion was found. The court also deemed that it was necessary to the disposition of the appeal to hold the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant marshal challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which convicted him for three counts of violating Cal. Penal Code &sect; 424 by keeping false accounts and misappropriating public moneys, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 6200, which outlawed destruction and falsification of public records, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 31114, which outlawed tampering with a county civil service examination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reviewing court affirmed the convictions of defendant marshal. The court held that the subpoenaed records were official records of the county and none were private property, and there was no requirement that defendant, as the head of a county department, be personally served. The court further held that there was overwhelming evidence to support the determination that defendant's systematic pattern of directing false entries, which related to the disbursement of public moneys, to be made fell within the meaning of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 424(3). The court held that defendant did not meet the burden of showing an intentional discriminatory enforcement. The court affirmed the trial court's finding that the transportation of the public official's family and staff was not related to county business, and it was a misappropriation of public funds to use publicly owned vehicles for unauthorized use. The court also held that there was substantial evidence that defendant violated Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 31114(3) by furnishing special and secret information to the oral examiners of county civil service system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed; the record supported the trial court's conclusion that defendant marshal had implemented a system for altering records, misappropriating public money, and using county property for private use. The court further held that defendant altered and destroyed public records in an attempt to conceal evidence and dispersed confidential information in order to influence the county civil service examination.</SPAN></P>
