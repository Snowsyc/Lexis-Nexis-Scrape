</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a jury verdict and various orders from the Third District Court, Salt Lake Department (Utah), in favor of plaintiff on plaintiff's claim for a partnership accounting and for one-third of the assets belonging to that partnership.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff accepted defendant's offer to become partners in a communications business. Years later, plaintiff left the business and filed an action requesting an accounting. Defendant appealed from a jury award, arguing that the trial court erred by: (1) instructing the jury on the applicable statute of limitations, (2) awarding prejudgment interest, and (3) failing to disqualify plaintiff counsel. The court affirmed the judgment but reversed the award of prejudgment interest. The court held that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that dissolution of the partnership occurred at a date that placed plaintiff's complaint within the statute of limitations. Further, plaintiff was not entitled to prejudgment interest because plaintiff failed to establish the factual predicate supporting his claim. Finally, plaintiff counsel's prior representation of defendant was not so substantially factually related to the present litigation that denial of motion to disqualify counsel prejudiced defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed in part and reversed in part. There was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that plaintiff's complaint was filed within the statute of limitations. Plaintiff was not, however, entitled to prejudgment interest because plaintiff failed to establish the factual predicate supporting his claim.</SPAN></P>

There was a reasonable basis for requiring the consent of the mother to adoption, but not the unwed father, before the father followed the procedures to establish his rights. Appellant father's argument that the court lacked jurisdiction under &sect; 78-30-4.15 was without merit because he was notified that the mother was on her way to Utah to carry out the adoption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for attempted murder pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-4-101 entered by the Court of Appeals, Third District, Salt Lake County (Utah) on the basis that the requirements of a successful insanity plea pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-2-305(1) violated both the due process and equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and that his sentence violated restrictions against cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction of two counts of attempted murder. The lower court held that defendant was not legally insane pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-2-305 or pursuant to the traditional M'Naughten Insanity Test because he had the requisite mens rea for attempted murder. In addition, the court found that defendant lacked standing to challenge the current treatment of mentally ill patients in prison when he was not yet situated there. On appeal, defendant challenged the requirements of a successful insanity plea pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-2-305(1) by contending that the statute violated both the due process and equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Defendant also contended that his sentence violated restrictions against cruel and unusual punishment. The court found that no breach of defendant's due process or equal protection rights had occurred and that the statutory scheme did not differentiate between mentally ill people based on the content of their delusions. Lastly, defendant was not disposed of the right to raise issues regarding the conditions of his incarceration when he had not yet been imprisoned.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction of two counts of attempted murder was upheld.

Lastly, the court concluded that defendant was not disposed of the right to raise issues regarding the conditions of his incarceration when he had not yet been imprisoned.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted cross petitions for writs of certiorari to the Utah Court of Appeals to review a summary judgment against plaintiff finding that her negligence claims were barred by the now repealed Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-10-7, abrogation of a remedy for her claims did not violate Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 11, and an officer who undertook a high-speed chase owed a duty of due care to other persons using the highway.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded a summary judgment for defendants in plaintiff's action seeking redress for personal injuries to herself and for the wrongful death of her husband arising from the collision of their vehicle with one pursued by the Utah Highway Patrol. The pursuit was initiated to cite the driver for speeding 10 miles per hour over the limit. The court concluded that a duty of care was owed to plaintiffs from an officer engaged in pursuit of a suspect on the highway, under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 41-6-14, which was not to say that defendants had a duty to control the errant driver. The duty to apprehend lawbreakers was not absolute, especially where the violation was only a misdemeanor, and there was a serious risk of death or injury to third persons or the fugitive. A police officer generally had only qualified immunity, not absolute immunity, even when what he did was clearly discretionary. Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-10-7, which immunized defendants from negligence suits, had no sound basis for the abrogation of a negligence remedy and violated the open courts provision of the Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 11. Accordingly, this suit was not precluded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded a summary judgment in favor of defendants on plaintiff's claims for personal injuries and wrongful death arising from a police officer's high-speed chase. The court concluded that a duty of care was owed to plaintiffs from the police officer and that defendants were not immunized from suit under a certain statute, which it found to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Plaintiffs requested a rule invalidating the method by which defendant apportioned taxable property of interstate airline carriers and for an adjustment of the value apportioned to it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, city and school district, alleged that they were aggrieved and injured because they were deprived of substantial allocated taxable aircraft value by virtue of the straight line method of apportioning aircraft value among various tax levying districts of Utah. Such injury brought the case within the jurisdiction of the district court and the court's holding that it had no jurisdiction was reversed. The court found that the passage of an aircraft for a few seconds or minutes at thousands of feet in the skies above a taxing entity did not create the sort of tangible or substantial contact with the taxing entity required as a threshold for constitutional jurisdiction under Utah Const. art. XIII, &sect; 10. The apportionment method was, therefore, declared unconstitutional. Plaintiffs' case was remanded for promulgation of a rule that conformed with the constitutional principles. The ruling was prospective only from its date of issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's holding that it had no jurisdiction to treat plaintiffs' petition from the state tax commission was reversed and remanded because plaintiffs' injury from deprivation of allocated taxable aircraft value brought the case within district court jurisdiction. The state tax commission's ruling was also reversed, because the straight line apportionment method of tax on aircraft value was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The state charged appellant with aggravated murder. The trial court convicted appellant and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence. Appellant did not show that the friendship between appellant's appointed counsel and the prosecutor created a conflict of interest in violation of his U.S. Const. amend. VI right to counsel. The trial court's failure to investigate appellant's letter expressing dissatisfaction with counsel was harmless error because appellant did not show that he would have prevailed had he received a substitute; the evidence against him was extensive and overwhelming, and appellant and his counsel did not suffer communication breakdown. Utah's death penalty procedures were constitutional. The trial court did not err in its application of the sentencing aggravating circumstances, where appellant claimed lack of notice, as appellant did not show prejudice to his defense; appellant's counsel was not ineffective where he failed to object on the grounds of unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Third District Court, Salt Lake County (Utah), convicting him of murder, and appealed enhanced sentences imposed by the district court pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-3-203(1) and -203.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder. The trial court ordered his sentences be enhanced pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-3-203(1) and -203.1. Defendant requested that the court reverse the group criminal activity enhancement on the basis that Utah. Code Ann. &sect; 76-3-203.1 violated both the U.S. and Utah constitutions. The court reversed and remanded the case on the Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-3-203.1 charge. The court held that the gang enhancement statute created a separate criminal offense by combining a separate mental element, &quot;in concert,&quot; with a criminal act and, therefore, for the statute to satisfy state and federal due process concerns, plaintiff prosecution was required to prove the elements of the enhancement beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held further that the gang enhancement statute interfered with defendant's right to a jury trial; since the statute created a separate and new offense, each element was required to be found beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury, not the trial judge. Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-3- 203.1(5)(c) provided that the trial judge was to decide whether to impose the enhanced penalty, clearly violating the Utah Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee contractor built a building for appellant company in 1978. After snowfall caused the roof to collapse in 1993, appellant sued appellee for products liability, breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty of merchantability, and negligence. The court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment on the ground that the claims were time-barred. On appeal, the court affirmed. The builder's statute of repose, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-12-25.5, was held constitutional; because it reasonably eliminated economic evils caused by liability insurance costs and records storage costs, &sect; 78-12-25.5 did not violate the open courts clause, Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 11. &sect; 78-12-25.5 was not subject to a discovery rule, and appellant's claims were thus barred. Appellant did not show that the parties expressed intent to extend the roof's warranty beyond six years. The builder's statute of repose, rather than the products liability statute of limitations, was applicable because the repose statute was intended for actions concerning improvements of real property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When plaintiffs sustained damage to their personal property as a result of a fire, they brought an action against defendants, who had all participated in the construction of the apartments, in which they alleged negligence. Defendants each moved for summary judgment, and argued that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-12-25.5 (1996), the &quot;builders statute of repose,&quot; barred plaintiffs' cause of action. The district court granted defendants' motions. On appeal, plaintiffs argued that the builders statute of repose violated Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 11, the open courts clause, in that it unconstitutionally eliminated their right to a remedy for injury to their property. They also argued that the provisions of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-12-25.5, were internally inconsistent and therefore inoperable. Finally, plaintiffs argued that the twelve-year statute of repose did not apply because it was subject to a discovery rule. Upon review, however, the court found plaintiffs had presented nothing that dissuaded it from ruling that the builders statute of repose barred their action. Consequently, the judgment of the district court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. V, &sect; 1 and, therefore, that petitioner's proceedings that recommended public sanctions against respondent judge were void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Members of petitioner, judicial conduct commission, made recommendations to the state supreme court regarding judicial misconduct and discipline. The statute calling for the appointment of members to petitioner commission was deemed to be unconstitutional because members of the senate were appointed to petitioner by the president of the senate, and members of the house were appointed to petitioner by the speaker of the house. These appointments by and of legislators to a commission responsible for reviewing conduct of members of the judiciary was considered to be a constitutional violation of the separation of powers clause under Utah Const. Art. V, &sect; 1, and a recommendation for sanctions against respondent was voided. Upon review, it was determined that the function performed by petitioner was not one exclusively within the province of the judicial branch. It was a function intended to be performed collaboratively by the several branches. The appointments to petitioner and the recommendations from petitioner were, therefore, constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A man was shot and killed during a gun battle at the home of defendant. Petitioners, wife and daughter, were at home at the time of the shooting. Defendant was arrested and charged with murder. One year after charges had been filed, and a week before trial was to begin, the trial court issued an order pursuant to the Subpoena Powers Act (act), Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-22-1 to 5, and permitted the state to subpoena petitioners to provide sworn statements to aid state in its pre-trial investigation of the victim's death. Defendant and petitioners filed a motion to quash the subpoenas, and contended that the act did not permit the issuance of subpoenas after the filing of criminal charges. The trial court opposed the motion to quash. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and ordered the trial court to quash the subpoenas. The court found that the plain language of the act was ambiguous as to when the subpoena power could be used. The legislative history pointed to the use of the act to aid in the investigation, not once charges had been filed. The court held that the act could only be used by the state prior to the filing of formal criminal charges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant injured sought review of a decision from the First District Court, Box Elder County (Utah), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendant state in plaintiff insurance company's interpleader action to determine to which parties it owed funds. The grant of summary judgment to the state enforced the state's Utah Code Ann. &sect; 26-19-5(1) Medicaid lien against the injured's insurance proceeds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured was severely hurt in a car accident. In order to receive Medicaid assistance for the injured, his guardian assigned to the state the injured's rights against third parties liable for his medical expenses, pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 26-19-4.5. The insurance company of the tortfeasor brought an interpleader action to determine to which of the accident victim or state it would remit policy proceeds. The trial court granted summary judgment to the state, as against the injured, thus enforcing the lien the state had on the injured's portion of the insurance proceeds. The court affirmed that decision. First, &sect; 26-19-4.5 did not violate the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396p(a)(1) of the Social Security Act prohibition against the state imposing a lien on the property of an individual for reimbursing Medicare expenses; the insurance proceeds were not part of the injured's property until the amount assigned to the state was satisfied. Second, repayment of the Medicaid lien took precedence over the establishment of a special needs trust. Third, the state's lien did not constitute an unconstitutional taking because the injured did not have an interest in the funds assigned to the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision granting summary judgment in favor of the state and enforcing the state's Medicaid lien against the injured's insurance proceeds was affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Utah Code Ann. &sect; 17-2-6(2)(a)(i)(B) (Supp. 1998) provided an alternative method for a county to annex a municipality that straddled a county line and extended into an adjoining county, where the county line was originally defined by a stream, river, or body of water. The appellate court held that a law was general in nature when it applied equally to all persons in a class founded on some reasonable distinction. The appellate court held that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 17-2-6(2) provided an exception to the general method by which a county could annex a portion of an adjoining county. The exception was for the annexation of a municipality that crossed a county line whose boundary was originally defined by a body of water. No exception was made for municipalities that crossed county boundaries defined by other geographical features or artificially drawn county lines. The appellate court held the record disclosed no rational basis for distinguishing municipalities that crossed a county line whose boundary was a body of water from those whose boundaries were otherwise defined.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder, and sentenced accordingly. Defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. The Fifth District Court, St. George Department (Utah) dismissed his petition on the ground that defendant had failed to file his petition within the one-year statute of limitations period pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-35a-107. Defendant appealed the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the appeals process, defendant was represented by several attorneys. Defendant requested a copy of his case from the court of appeals and discovered that the court had executed an order dismissing his appeal for failure to file an appellant's brief. Defendant argued that the one-year statute of limitations provision in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-35a-107 was unconstitutional. The appellate court held the mere passage of time could never justify continued imprisonment of one who had been deprived of fundamental rights, regardless of how difficult it might be for the State to reprosecute that individual. Thus, no statute of limitations could be constitutionally applied to bar a habeas petition. Proper consideration of meritorious claims raised in a habeas petition would always be in the interests of justice. Therefore, courts were required to always consider the interests of justice exception in &sect; 78-35a-107 when a petitioner raised meritorious claims. The trial court dismissed the instant petition without considering whether the interests of justice excused defendant's failure to file within the one-year period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant contended that the trial judge should have been recused from presiding over the matter, that the sentencing scheme under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-3-207 was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague, and that defendant had received ineffective assistance of counsel. The court held that, because defendant failed to condition his plea on the reservation of his claim that the trial judge should have been recused, the claim was waived. The court held that defendant's constitutional challenge was moot because the trial court had stricken the testimony in question, and therefore the trial court had not improperly considered defendant's religious beliefs at sentencing. The court rejected defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim because defendant did not show that he was prejudiced by his counsel's performance.

Appellants sought review of the decision that the trust was charitable. The parties were members of a religious sect, which experienced dissension resulting in a land dispute. The court found that the trial court's equitable ruling allowing appellees to remain on the land for their lifetimes or for compensation if removed was proper because an expectation in the property was formed and improvements had been made on the land. However, the court found that the trial court erred in its interpretation of the Utah Occupying Claimants Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 57-6-1 to 8, and that the findings were insufficient to determine whether any or all appellees had life estates.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the lower court of committing sodomy upon his two daughters and sentenced to two concurrent prison terms of fifteen years to life. Defendant appealed and the court affirmed. Defendant filed a petition in the district court for extraordinary relief pursuant to Utah R. Civ.

The court reversed and remanded the case and held that &sect; 76-5-411 did not apply to child victims' out-of-court statements regarding sexual abuse that may have been admitted as substantive evidence under existing evidentiary rules. The court found that the habeas court erred in ruling that &sect; 76-5-411 overrode the hearsay exceptions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state charged defendant pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 58-37-8(2)(a)(I). Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the criminal charge, and the trial court denied the motion. The Court of Appeals for the Third District (Utah) held that the forfeiture of defendant's car, pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 58-37-13(1)(e) (1994), constituted punishment for double jeopardy purposes and barred the subsequent criminal prosecution. The state sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state forfeited defendant's car after a search of the vehicle revealed cocaine. The state thereafter filed a criminal charge for possession of a controlled substance. Defendant moved for dismissal, claiming that the charge constituted an attempt to punish him twice for the same crime and therefore violated his constitutional right against double jeopardy. The trial court denied the motion, but the court of appeals reversed. On further review, the court reversed the court of appeals' judgment and affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found that the legislature viewed the forfeiture measure as a civil penalty, not a criminal penalty. The fact that the prosecuting officials were required to file the forfeiture complaint was done only for pragmatic reasons. The court held that the forfeiture of defendant's car was not punishment for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. Although the value of defendant's car was between $ 2925 and $ 4600 and the costs of the state's investigation and prosecution was only $ 2500, such a difference was not so disproportionate as to result in a penalty to defendant. Defendant failed to properly raise the issue under the Utah Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord claimed that the tenant failed to plead forcible entry in his complaint, failed to satisfy the indorsement requirements of the Utah forcible entry statute.

The court held that the landlord had failed to timely object to the amendment by the tenant, which added the forcible entry statutory claim, and tried the matter by consent consistent with Utah R.

The court held that the sign that the landlord removed from the monument on the premises of the property was not real property covered by the forcible entry statute and thus the tenant was not entitled to recover treble damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorneys sought review of the order of respondent Utah Public Service Commission, awarding attorney fees but reducing the hours claimed by 25 percent, rejecting application of a multiplier or an award of a percentage of the common fund, reducing paralegal compensation, denying compensation for secretarial work, and refusing to award any attorney fees related to the adjudication of the attorney fees themselves.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that it had jurisdiction to review the attorney fees order as a final agency action under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-46b-16(1), and that fairness required review under an intermediate standard, because the Commission was the trier of fact as well as one of the parties. The court found that the evidence did not support the Commission's arbitrary 25 percent reduction of the number of hours claimed by the attorneys, but rather that the hours claimed were reasonable in view of the novelty and difficulty of the questions presented, the complete lack of support from consumer agencies, and the actions of the Commission, which generally made the case very difficult. The court reduced the hours of the first attorney by 9.5 hours to reflect the hours spent by others at the same litigation meetings. Given the extraordinary results obtained by attorneys, the court awarded a multiplier to take into consideration delay of payment, risk, quality of work, contingency, and the attorney's burden. Because the common fund was quite high, the court found that a multiplier of 2.5 was appropriate, and that $ 1,201,843 represented a reasonable attorney fee award.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the attorney fees award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, property owners who sought to build an RV park on their property, sought review of a decision from the trial court (Utah), which entered judgment that the water rate schedule imposed by appellee town was valid and enforceable. The town charged different rates to residents and nonresident water users. The trial court denied the property owners' request for an injunction and damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners contended that the trial court erred in ruling that the town's rate schedule, which generally charged higher connection and user fees to nonresidents, did not discriminate illegally. On appeal, the court held that in the sale of water, a scarce resource in which the public has an interest, municipalities must deal reasonably with nonresidents, as they were required to do with their own residents. The court held that rates established by a municipality for utility service to inhabitants were presumptively reasonable. The court held that if the difference in water rates was reasonably related to a difference in the costs of providing the service, there was no unreasonable discrimination. Accordingly, the court ordered the case be remanded. The court held that on remand the trial court was required to address whether the disparate rate charged nonresidents was justified and, if so, whether the town nonetheless breached a contract with the property owners when it enacted the new rate schedule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case to the trial court, which had entered judgment that the water rate schedule imposed by the town was valid and enforceable.

Defendant previously sought to amend a pending petition to include due process claims based on new case law, but the court that heard the petition dismissed it as moot because the parole board had already granted defendant another hearing voluntarily. Defendant did not appeal the dismissal. Defendant then filed the petition for extraordinary relief in the district court. The court affirmed the dismissal by the district court of defendant's petition for extraordinary relief. The court held that because defendant's hearing was held before the decision in a case involving due process in parole hearings, it did not apply to defendant's due process claims. The court held that the parole board's power in setting determinate parole dates did not violate the separation of powers doctrine under Utah Const. art. V, &sect; 1. The court found that defendant's other due process claims that challenged parole board procedures and powers were without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation sought review of the decision of the Third District Court, Salt Lake Div. I. (Utah), which held that the statute that granted the district court jurisdiction to review appellee tax commission's decision, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-1-601, did not apply retroactively, thus, it did not have jurisdiction to hear the corporation's challenge to appellee board of equalization's decision concerning a real property tax assessment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that &sect; 59-1-601, which granted parties the choice to seek review in the district court by trial de novo or with the court by the standard of review set forth in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-1-610, were procedural in nature. Thus, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-1-601 could be applied retroactively and the tax commission's failure to act on the request for reconsideration was a final decision subject to review under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-46b-13(3)(b). The court held that the broad grant of power in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-1-601 ran counter to the limiting aspect of Utah. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 11, because &sect; 59-1-601 supplants the tax commission's duty to adjust and equalize the valuation and assessment of property by vesting in the district courts jurisdiction to review by trial de novo the tax commissions decisions on such matters. The statute violated Utah Const. art. XIII, &sect; 3 because it was beyond the legislature's authority to prescribe by law provisions to secure just valuation for taxation of tangible property. The statute also violated Utah Const. art. V, &sect; 1, which barred the judicial branch from exercising functions of another branch of government.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the district court erred by dismissing the corporation's petition for review on the basis that the statute did not apply retroactively.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoners were both serving sentences for first degree felonies when they were charged under &sect; 76-5-103.5(2)(b) for aggravated assault on an inmate and a guard, respectively.

The court held that &sect; 76-5-103.5(2)(b) was cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment because the objective indicia of public attitude did not reflect anything like widespread acceptance of capital punishment for assault by a prisoner because the evolving standards of decency weighed against such punishment. The court also held that death was an excessive punishment for the crime of assault by a prisoner because it made no measurable contribution to acceptable goals of punishment and was grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A prisoner was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. His conviction was affirmed on appeal. The prisoner filed a petition for habeas corpus, which was initially dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies. The prisoner then petitioned for mandamus, his case was transferred to district court, and the claim was dismissed as frivolous. That decision was reversed, and the case was remanded for evidentiary hearing. After the hearing, the trial court granted summary judgment to the state, finding that the claim was barred by the four-year statute of limitations in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-12-25, among other grounds. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that a habeas corpus action could not be raised until other forms of relief, including direct appeal, had been exhausted. The prisoner's action for habeas corpus, which was filed in July 1993, did not accrue until after his direct appeal was decided on May 19, 1989. Because this decision occurred after the legislature's deletion of imprisonment as a disability that tolled the statute of limitations under &sect; 78-12-36, the trial court correctly held that petitioner's claim was time-barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of a decision that held that an environmental surcharge imposed on them by appellees under the Underground Storage Tank Act was constitutional. The court initially reversed and held that the surcharge was a tax and, therefore, unconstitutional. The court sua sponte granted a rehearing and vacated its prior decision, holding that the surcharge was constitutional. In its first opinion, the court had held that the surcharge was a tax because appellants did not benefit from the Petroleum Tank Storage Fund that was created by Utah Code Ann. &sect; 19-6-409. The court reversed that decision, stating that appellants would have benefited from the fund because a spill at one of their tanks would have been covered by the fund. The court said that the benefit was not illusory because the state could not have recovered repayment from appellants for moneys expended from the fund to clean up a spill. The court further held that the surcharge bore a reasonable relationship to the cost of the benefit. The court said that such fees were imposed by the legislature and presumed reasonable. The court held that appellants had not proven that the surcharge was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The city's construction of the secondary irrigation system required residents who desired connection and owned shares in the city's mutual irrigation companies to transfer water shares to the city. Non-water shareowners were only required to pay cash. The landowner requested a secondary water connection but refused to exchange his shares in the irrigation company for the connection. The city returned his cash payment, notifying him that as a water shareowner he had to transfer his shares in order to connect. The landowner argued that the city's requirement for connection was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the dismissal of the landowner's action because the connection to the secondary water system was optional. Because the value of the landowner's shares were not taken or damaged by the city's legislation, there was no constitutional violation.

The Interlocal Cooperation Act, &sect; 11-13-20(2) of the Utah Code, specifically provided that actions taken pursuant to that statute and authorized by resolution could not be the subject of a referendum petition.

His work was confined exclusively to a separate branch within the Division of Environmental Response and Remediation (DERR). The court first observed that the appeals court had determined that the oil company had not demonstrated actual bias. The court then held that DERR had accomplished an appropriate and sufficient separation of functions at the individual level by segregating the presiding officer from contact with the investigative and prosecutorial arm of DERR. A workable scheme was created within the agency to prevent the presiding officer from engaging in multiple functions likely to bias his work as an adjudicator.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent was left in a coma after surgical treatment by defendant doctor at defendant hospital. After the doctor engaged in activities to confuse investigation, plaintiff family initiated a medical malpractice suit after decedent's death. The Third District Court of Utah granted summary judgment for the doctor and hospital, ruling that the family's action was barred by the statute of limitations, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-14-4. The family appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the family's wrongful death claims were governed by the two-year statute of limitations for medical malpractice actions contained in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-14-4.

The court remanded the case for a factual finding as to whether the family's claims of fraudulent concealment by the doctor would toll the statute of limitations as to their wrongful death and survival claims. The court held that the decedent's children were not entitled to bring a wrongful death claim because their mother had a guardian appointed at the time of her death, so the children were not entitled to the provisions of the tolling statute. Finally, the court held that the family's claims for common law fraud were also governed by the two-year medical malpractice statute of limitations found in &sect; 78-14-4. The court declined to reach the family's claims of the unconstitutionality of its reading of malpractice statute.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's holdings that the two-year statute of limitations had run on the action in general and that the action of the decedent's children was tolled due to their minority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for rape and sodomy of a child. The appellate court vacated the convictions because the trial court erred in denying a challenge for cause of a biased juror.

The court adopted the cure-or-waive rule and held that defendant should have used a peremptory challenge against the juror who was unsuccessfully challenged for cause to have preserved the error on appeal. The court concluded that the loss of a peremptory challenge does not constitute a violation of the constitutional right to an impartial jury. The court stated that defendant chose to use his four peremptory challenges on female jurors to attempt to seat the &quot;most favorable&quot; jury rather than using his challenge for an impartial jury. The court held that the cure-or-waive rule did apply to defendant's convictions because it did not represent an abrupt and fundamental shift in doctrine, application of a rule in the case in which it was announced was not retroactive application, and defendant had no federal constitutional claim so it could not have been blocked by a state procedural rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inmate contended that Utah R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) was not applicable to dismiss his habeas corpus petition against wardens and that only Utah R. Civ. P. 65B applied. Inmate sought to raise issues of ineffective assistance of counsel to challenge his murder conviction. The court affirmed the application of Rule 12(b)(6), but reversed to permit dismissal without prejudice with leave to amend. The court found that Rule 65B dealt primarily with the mechanics of a habeas corpus petition and that Rule 12(b)(6) could still be applied to dismiss a petition for failure to state a claim. Because in raising the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel, inmate only alleged errors and failed to allege any prejudice, the court concluded that Rule 12(b)(6) was properly applied to dismiss the petition. The court determined that the dismissal should be without prejudice because a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal was generally not final and leave to amend was usually granted unless there was a certainty that no claim could be stated.</SPAN></P>

III, Second. They also sought reimbursement of the property taxes they allegedly overpaid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners were residents of other states and owned residential property in the state. Because the owners did not use their residential properties as primary residences, the Taxing Authorities determined that they did not qualify for the residential property tax exemption provided by Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-2-103(2). As a result, the owners paid property taxes based upon 100 percent of the fair market value of their residential properties, instead of 55 percent of the fair market value as provided by the tax exemption. The owners challenged the statute and sought reimbursement. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Taxing Authorities. Plaintiffs appealed arguing that the tax exemption impermissibly discriminated on the basis of residency. The court held that the tax exemption did not discriminate on the basis of residency because the crucial qualification for the exemption was the use of the property, not the residency of the owner. The court found that a resident of the state who owned residential property in the state but did not use that property as a primary residence was taxed in the same manner as the owners were.</SPAN></P>

Several months later, the inmate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.

Second, the trial court found that the inmate knew about his right to appeal but that he had waived that right. A second petition for a writ of habeas corpus was denied on the same grounds. The court reversed and remanded. The inmate had written a letter to the convicting court within 30 days of his conviction stating that his lawyer would not speak to him and that he wished to appeal. Court personnel had misplaced the letter. The court held that the trial court had to determine whether the inmate truly did waive his appeal. If the letter was a notice of appeal, the trial court was to reinstate the appeal because the letter was filed within the required 30 days. If, on the other hand, the trial court determined that the letter was an attempt to file a petition for habeas corpus, the initial petition was properly dismissed because it was premature.</SPAN></P>

The court first held that the Commission's determination of fair market value was reviewable as a question of fact.

Substantial evidence supported the Commission finding that the assessments reflected the apartments' fair market value. Further, the court found that the use of contract rents in calculating the income rather than market rent did not violate Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 24, Utah. Const.&nbsp;art. XIII, &sect; 2.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff fuel distributor appealed from a judgment of the District Court, Third District, Salt Lake County (Utah), that dismissed his action against defendant state tax commission that alleged the state one-half cent environmental &quot;surcharge&quot; on motor vehicle fuels delivered to underground storage tanks was a tax and violated provisions of Utah Const. art. XIII, &sect; 13 that banned the expenditure of any motor fuel tax for non-highway purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff fuel distributor filed a complaint against defendant state tax commission claiming that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 19-6-410, which established a motor fuel surcharge, violated Utah Const. art. XIII, &sect; 13, which restricted spending of motor vehicle fuel &quot;excise taxes&quot; to highway purposes. Plaintiff argued that the surcharge was an excise tax and that revenues from the surcharge were deposited into and spent from an insurance fund for underground storage tank (UST) owners, which was a non-highway purpose. Plaintiff also sought a refund of surcharges paid and attorney's fees. The district court ruled that the surcharge was a legitimate fee and not a tax. On appeal, the court held that the surcharge was a tax and not a regulatory fee because fund monies generated by the surcharge were dedicated to providing insurance services to a segment of the UST industry, not to regulating it. Therefore, the court held that &sect; 19-6-410 was unconstitutional to the extent that the surcharge was levied on motor fuels. The court held that plaintiff was entitled to a refund, but not entitled to attorney's fees under the Small Business Equal Access to Justice Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 78-27a-1 to -6.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court judgment, holding that the statute that established a motor fuel surcharge was unconstitutional because the surcharge was a tax on motor fuels used for non-highway purposes in violation of provisions of the Utah Constitution that restricted spending of motor vehicle fuel &quot;excise taxes&quot; to highway purposes. The court held that plaintiff fuel distributor was entitled to a refund and remanded.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a notice of his intent to rely on a defense of diminished capacity or insanity, pursuant Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-14-3. A clinical director testified that defendant had intent and knew that his forced sexual intercourse with the victim was wrong but that defendant was unable to conform his conduct to the law. Defendant entered into a conditional plea on the rape and aggravated robbery charges, which was conditioned on defendant's right to appeal the trial court's adverse ruling on his constitutional challenges. Defendant was sentenced to two concurrent five-to-life terms. The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentence and held that defendant failed to demonstrate how Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-2-305, which allowed for the conviction of those who had the requisite mens rea, even though they might not be able to control their actions, was cruelly inhumane or disproportionate to the crime involved.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant prison doctor appealed the interlocutory decision of the Third District, Salt Lake County (Utah), that denied his motion for summary judgment that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-4(4) was unconstitutional under Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 11, the open courts clause of the Utah Constitution, in an underlying negligence action filed by plaintiff inmate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff prison inmate alleged that defendant prison doctor negligently misdiagnosed his leg fracture as cartilage and ligament damage, failed to treat the fracture, and ignored his repeated complaints of severe pain. As a result, his leg healed improperly and physicians at the University of Utah Medical Center had to perform surgery to rebreak the leg and set it properly with pins and metal rods. The court concluded that defendant's rendering of medical care to prisoners could not properly be described as ministerial in nature at common law, as a great deal of judgment and opinion were involved in making a diagnosis and prescribing appropriate medical treatment. Under common law at the time of statehood, physicians employed by the state to provide medical care to prisoners would not have been liable for negligence. Thus, the court found that maintaining immunity for prison physicians from actions for negligence, but subjecting them to liability for fraud or malice is a reasonable method of meeting prisoners' needs while maintaining discipline in the prison.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff prisoner appealed from a judgment of the Third District Court, Salt Lake County (Utah) holding that the Utah Governmental Immunity Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-34(1)(a) &amp; (b), limited his recovery of personal injury damages to the amount of $ 250,000 in his action against defendants, officials of the Department of Corrections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officials cross-appealed from judgments against them. The officials contended that a statutory governmental immunity applied to shield them from the prisoner's negligence and state constitutional actions. They also argued that article I, section 9 of the Utah constitution could not be the basis of an award of monetary damages. The court held that subsections 63-30-4(3) and (4) of the Utah Code, which provided that government employees could not be liable for injuries in the absence of fraud or malice, were constitutional as applied to a prisoner's negligence claims against prison employees. The court also held that article I, section 9 of the Utah Constitution against unnecessarily rigorous treatment of prisoners, provided a basis for an award of monetary damages if a prisoner proved that a prison employee was deliberately indifferent to his medical needs or subjected him to clearly excessive or deficient and unjustified treatment. Finally, the court held that the statutory cap on damages was an unreasonable regulation of the prisoner's article I, section 9 rights. Accordingly, the court reversed the trial court's decision and remanded the action to the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision and remanded the action, with instructions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission suspended the lodges' private club liquor licenses after finding that the lodges failed to comply with DABC directives providing that clubs discriminating in their membership policies would not be allowed to maintain state liquor licenses. The court affirmed the suspension orders, finding that the Commission correctly applied the UCRA to the lodges, and that its finding that the lodges practiced discrimination in their policies was supported by substantial evidence. The court held that the directives did not violate the constitutional right of freedom of association because the state interest in prohibiting gender-based discrimination outweighed the lodges' associational interests in maintaining state-licensed liquor clubs. The court held that neither the UCRA nor the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 32A-5-101 to -108, were unconstitutionally vague or overbroad and that they did not impose unconstitutional conditions. Finally, the court affirmed the Commission's finding that the passive act of having a standing policy that barred the membership of women was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and remanded. A prior ruling that the three-month statute of limitations for habeas corpus petitions was unconstitutional had the binding effect of stare decisis. The court was convinced of the correctness of the court of appeals' decision. The record was insufficient to provide a basis upon which to determine the nature of the convict's claims. The convict's petition could fairly have been interpreted as involving issues of procedural due process that may have been subject to judicial review or substantive issues exclusively within the board's discretion. To the extent the convict challenged the fairness of the procedure followed by the board in setting his parole rehearing date, the convict stated a claim reviewable under Rule 65B(e).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayers appealed a decision from respondent Utah State Tax Commission (commission), which assessed Utah income tax on their earnings as a county commissioner and a state employee during the years 1988 through 1990 and which required the taxpayers to pay $ 10,855.38 in taxes, penalties, and interest prior to pursuing their appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers, husband and wife, were members of the Navajo Tribe and lived on the Navajo Reservation in Utah. The husband was employed as a county commissioner. The wife was employed by the state department of human services to provide mental health services to Utah Navajos living on the reservation. She performed approximately 80 percent of her duties on the reservation. The commission determined that the taxpayers' income was fully taxable to Utah and that the taxpayers were required to deposit the deficiency to pursue their appeal. The taxpayers challenged the commission's decisions. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that: (1) the commission erred when it assessed Utah income tax on the wife because the state's interest in providing mental health services to the reservation was insufficient to overcome the presumption against state taxing jurisdiction; (2) the imposition of income tax on the husband was proper because the state's interest in his income as a county commissioner was sufficient to overcome the presumption; and (3) depositing the deficiency did not deny the taxpayers reasonable access to judicial review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court affirmed the commission's ruling that the husband's entire income as a county commissioner was subject to Utah income tax. However, the court reversed the commission's ruling that the wife's income as a state employee was taxable in Utah. Finally, the court affirmed the commission's ruling that required the taxpayers to pay their deficiency prior to pursuing their appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that his right to confront and cross-examine witnesses was violated because only a partial transcript of the original preliminary hearing held 10 years earlier was available.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction. It held that: (1) defendant failure to cite to any errors in the record in his brief was grounds for assuming regularity in the proceedings and correctness in the judgment appealed from; (2) there was no legal support for defendant's assertion that he was entitled to depose witnesses who did not testify at the preliminary hearing; (3) defendant had failed to establish any basis under Utah R. Crim. P. 14(h) that would have allowed him to take the depositions he requested; and (4) defendant's son should not have been allowed to invoke his right against self-incrimination but any error was harmless because the other evidence against defendant was substantial and supported his conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was detained on a violation of a loitering ordinance. A subsequent search uncovered a stolen weapon and he was charged with burglary and theft. The trial court denied his pretrial motion to suppress evidence gathered at the time of his arrest. He filed an interlocutory appeal, and the Utah Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's order. The defendant's appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the defendant's appeal challenging the admission of evidence on a theory that the detention, search, and arrest were improper, the court held that the officers were within the proper scope of their duties when they initially detained the defendant for loitering. Officers had a duty to enforce a law that was not held unconstitutional. The officers' decision to run a warrants check on an individual detained for violating that ordinance was also proper. Because defendant voluntarily informed the officers that he possessed a weapon, the officers were allowed to conduct a brief pat-down search of the defendant to ensure their safety. Because his companion consented to a search of her vehicle, the search that produced the weapon was also acceptable. However, the officers impermissibly expanded the scope of their detention of the defendant when they additionally ran a check on the serial number of the gun. Nothing indicated that the weapon was stolen, and the weapon was legally carried in the vehicle notwithstanding the fact it was concealed and contained ammunition in the clip. Therefore the evidence gathered as a result of the improper search was illegally obtained.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the part of the order that held that the officers did not improperly exceed the scope of their initial detention of the defendant when they ran a stolen weapons check on the gun found. The court precluded admission into evidence of the weapon. The court affirmed the remainder of the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecutor charged the juveniles as adults under the direct-file statute,&nbsp;Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-3a-25, of the Juvenile Courts Act. Whether &sect; 78-3a-25 violated Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 24, the uniform operation of laws provision, depended on whether it was rationally related to the purpose for enacting that statute which was to protect the public and address the needs of the juveniles. Utah Code Ann. 78-3a-1. Because &sect; 78-3a-25 created two classes of juveniles, those that remained within the jurisdiction of the juvenile courts, and those that were to have been tried as adults, even though all juveniles had committed the same crimes and were within the same age range, this created non-uniformity. Furthermore, because &sect; 78-3a-25 gave unbridled discretion to the prosecutors to decide which juvenile was placed in either class, given the critically important differences in treatment between the two classifications, this amounted to unequal treatment without any rationally related purpose to balancing the needs of the juvenile with public protection. Finally, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-3a-30(9), that permitted placing juveniles in jail or other adult facility was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgments that held Utah's direct-file statute was constitutional because the statute gave prosecutors undirected discretion to choose where to file charges against certain juvenile offenders in violation of the uniform laws provision of the Utah Constitution. Consequently, the court remanded the juveniles to the jurisdiction of the juvenile courts for certification proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with murder and attempted murder. They alleged that Utah's insanity defense statutes were unconstitutional.&nbsp;Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-2-305 limited the insanity defense to simply that the defendant did not have the requisite mens rea of the alleged crime. The former statute had permitted defendants to defend on the ground that they committed the act but did not understand that the act was wrong. Under &sect; 76-2-305, the mens rea model, it did not matter whether defendants understood that the act was wrong. On appeal, the court held that (1) it could not strike down the statute unless it violated the constitution, (2) there was no federal due process right to an independent defense of insanity, (3) the Utah legislature's policy decision to limit the traditional insanity defense did not violate defendants' state due process rights, (4) &sect; 76-2-305 did not shift the burden of proof to the defendants to prove that they lacked the requisite mens rea to commit the crime, (5) the statute did not violate equal protection rights by treating similarly situated individuals differently, and (6) compelled mental exams did not violate defendants' right against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

The district court held that even if the taxpayer's claims were not time barred the taxpayer could not recover under the terms of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-2-1321.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer's ad valorem taxes were based, in part, on the taxable value of underground gas rights, which were determined from the sales during the year. When the taxpayer was ordered to refund overcharges to its customers, it filed a suit for a refund of its ad valorem taxes. The taxpayer contended that the sales on which the tax was based were now overstated; thus the taxes collected under those incorrect valuations should be refunded. On appeal, the court affirmed the grant of summary judgment dismissing the taxpayer's action because the taxes were not erroneously or illegally collected as required by &sect; 59-2-132; thus there was no basis for a refund. The trial court properly concluded that the terms erroneously or illegally collected did not include ad valorem taxes paid on the basis of a valuation which was correct at the time it was made, but later became erroneous due to factors not existing at the time of the valuation. Because the terms were not defined in the statute, the court considered the term in light of the entire Property Tax Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 59-2-101 to 1372, and found that the value of the assessment date had to be viewed retrospectively.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted county's motion for summary judgment. Building owners then filed a second complaint, which the trial court dismissed. The appellate court affirmed the entries of summary judgment and dismissal on the building owners' complaints. On appeal, the building owners argued that the appellate court erred in finding the county and its employee immune from liability. The court held that the county and its employee's actions were protected by the Governmental Immunity Act because their actions were the exercise of a governmental function, that building owners failed to plead their fraud claim with sufficient particularity, and that the second complaint was barred on grounds of res judicata.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first stated that it would not address issues that the proprietors did not raise before the trial court. The court also ruled that, under Utah R. App. P. 4, the proprietors' appeal of the summary judgment granted the state was untimely because it was filed more than 30 days after the order was certified under Utah R. Civ. P. 54(b). The court ruled that the trial court had the authority on remand to grant summary judgment after discovery provided the needed information on whether the governments' decisions were discretionary and immune or operational and not immune. The court added that the trial court also needed to decide whether the proprietors were entitled to go to the jury with their claims under the legal elements of a claim for negligence, including duty, breach of duty, causation, and damages. The court noted that uncontroverted evidence established that the flooding occurring in the spring of 1983 was unprecedented and a 100-year flood. Affirming the decision, the court explained that the proprietors failed to show the existence of a duty of due care that ran to them as individuals and not just to the public generally.</SPAN></P>

The state argued that the prejudgment interest rate applied was too low.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The coal companies operated a mine under a state lease. The royalty required under the lease was fixed at the higher of 15 cents per ton or the prevailing rate paid by federal lessees of land of similar character under coal leases issued by the United States. In 1977 the coal companies submitted a proposed mine plan to the state. At that point the federal royalty was 17.5 cents per coal ton. The companies operated the mine and paid that royalty rate for about a decade. In 1979, however, the federal law was changed to require an 8 per cent royalty, which was, or became, higher than 17.5 cents per ton. The state discovered the discrepancy during an audit and demanded that the coal companies make up the difference and declared that future royalties would be at 8 per cent. The court ruled that the alternative rate provision was not unenforceable as ambiguous. The court ruled that the state was not estopped from arguing that it was entitled to the higher rate. The court ruled that it was the coal companies' responsibility to inform the state of the change in the federal rate. The court held that the interest and penalty assessments required reevaluation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the state that the coal companies were liable for the higher royalty rate.

He then underwent spinal fusion surgery. The worker filed a second application for temporary total disability benefits but was denied because of the eight year limitation. The worker contended that the limitation was an unconstitutional statute of repose. The trial court disagreed, and the court affirmed. The statute was not facially unconstitutional; thus, it was presumed constitutional. The eight-year bar did not prevent the worker from asserting a claim for such benefits; indeed, he had.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged &sect; 78-3-31(6) of the Code, which empowered court commissioners, upon consent of a defendant, to conduct misdemeanor trials, impose sentence, and enter final judgments of conviction. According to defendant, this provision delegated the judicial power of the state to nonjudges in violation of article VIII, &sect; 1 of the Utah Constitution. The Utah Court of Appeals certified defendant's appeal to the court pursuant to rule 43 of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure. The court held that it was required to vacate defendant's conviction and remand his case to the circuit court for a new trial on the basis of the court's decision in Salt Lake City v. Ohms. The court explained that the majority in the Ohms case relied heavily on Labrum v. Utah State Board of Pardons in concluding that defendant Ohms, who sustained the burden of attacking an unconstitutional statute, should not be denied the benefit of his victory. Therefore, the court concluded that the retroactivity rule set out in Labrum applied to the present case, and because defendant's claim was pending when Ohms was decided, he should not be denied the benefits of that decision.</SPAN></P>

Following the rejection of the initiative by the city's council, the city's Recorder refused to place the initiative on the ballot for a general election that was to be held on November 8, 1994. Under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 20A-7-501(3)(d)(ii), municipal initiatives could only be voted on in municipal elections, which were held in odd-numbered years. Petitioner's request for an extraordinary writ to compel the placement of the initiative on the ballot for the general election was denied. The court reasoned that article VI, &sect; 1 of the Constitution (Utah), vested the legislature with the power to prescribe time for initiative elections. That section was presumed constitutional, and there was a reasonable basis for limiting municipal initiatives to municipal elections. Section 1 was not discriminatory because state-wide and county-wide initiatives could also only be voted on in even-numbered years. Utah Code Ann. &sect; 20A-7-501(3)(d)(ii), which repealed an earlier version of the statute, took effect before an initiative petition containing a proper number of certified signatures had been filed, so the earlier version was inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, county assessors of three Utah counties, sought review of the Utah State Tax Commission's (the Commission) charitable property tax exemption standards for nonprofit hospitals and nursing homes. The Commission had granted summary judgment in favor of respondent hospitals. The assessors argued that the Commission's standards violated Utah Const. art. XIII, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the court had determined nine years previously that Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 59-2-30 and -31 (1974) unconstitutionally expanded the scope of the tax exemption for charitable use granted by Utah Const. art. XIII, &sect; 2, the Commission announced new standards to suggest an objective and relatively simple framework for determining property tax exemption and to provide counties, property owners, and other interested parties with notice of the standards that the Commission intended to observe in deciding appeals from county boards of equalization. The court held that the linchpin of &quot;charity&quot; was the notion that a gift was being made by the hospitals to the community on an ongoing basis. It then applied a six-factor test to determine whether the hospitals were exempt from the payment of the taxes. The court determined that the Commission standards had not expanded the scope of the exemption beyond what was constitutionally permitted. The court then held that the hospitals were tax-exempt because the total gift to the community exceeded, on an annual basis, what would otherwise be the hospital's property tax liability for the year. The hospitals lessened the community's health care burden.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the Commission's standards were constitutional because they complied with the factors previously articulated by the court for granting a charitable use property tax exemption. The court affirmed the Commission's grant to the hospitals' of charitable exemptions which were made in accordance with those standards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reviewed an order of the Utah Public Service Commission that increased respondent utility company's authorized rate of return on equity to 12.2 percent, ordered central office modernizations and fiber-optic extensions to educational institutions, and adopted an incentive regulation plan that respondent vetoed pursuant to statutory authorization. The legal issue before the court was whether the Commission could increase the authorized rate of return on equity above a reasonable rate of return to induce a utility to make &quot;discretionary&quot; investments in its plant and equipment in Utah. The court held that the 12.2 percent rate of return on equity was unlawful, that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 54-4-4.1(2) was unconstitutional, that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 54-4-4.1(1) incorporated cost-of-service criteria as a limitation on the types of incentive plans that could be adopted by the Commission, and that the Commission's incentive regulation plan in this case was invalid.

The trial court granted summary judgment to the newspaper and awarded expenses and attorney fees. On appeal, the court agreed that the newspaper was entitled to reject the advertisement because the press could reject advertisements based upon content despite its overlapping into suspect classifications.

The court found that, because the state did not challenge that part of the appellate court ruling that the roadblock violated the federal constitution, any decision rendered by the court on the state constitutional issue would be moot. The court found that defendant's argument that individualized reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing was required prior to a search or seizure was moot. The court held that the state's claim that defendant's consent was sufficiently attenuated from the roadblock was precluded by the doctrine of res judicata because that issue had been decided by the court of appeals in a separate tax action involving defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the Tax Commission and held that the state's use of a tax valuation method identical to the county's on plaintiff's property without applying the county's 20 percent reduction as provided by Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-5-4.5 (Supp. 1986) violated article I, &sect; 24 and article XIII, &sect;&sect; 2 and 3 of the Utah Constitution. The court remanded the case for the purpose of calculating the reasonable fair cash value of plaintiff's real and personal property. The Tax Commission found that the prior case required property owners to bear an equal portion of the tax burden in proportion to the amount of property owned. The court of appeals found that the Tax Commission failed to follow the directives of the previous case. In reversing the decision of the court of appeals and remanding the matter, the court found that the previous case provided that when identical methods of property valuation are used by both the county and the state to assess taxable property, it was unconstitutional to give county property a reduction without giving state property the same reduction. However, when different methods of property valuation were used, the law did not mandate a reduction.</SPAN></P>

The court held that (1) the death qualification did not violate the Utah Constitution because the jury was impartial and defendant was not deprived of fundamental fairness; (2) defendant failed to establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination because he failed to demonstrate a strong likelihood of purposeful discrimination based on race or ethnicity; and (3) the trial court's finding that defendant was acting in concert was not clearly erroneous because it was supported by evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, local newspaper and employees, sought review by writ of certiorari from a decision of the Court of Appeals, Fifth District, Washington County (Utah), which reversed the lower court's dismissal of plaintiff mayor's claims and summary judgment on other of plaintiff's claims, which alleged defamatory statements by defendants. Defendants contended that there was no actionable defamation, under Utah Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1 and 15.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mayor filed a defamation claim against defendants, local newspaper and employees, for statements in defendant's editorial columns. The lower court dismissed some claims and granted summary judgment to defendants on others, but upon appeal, that decision was reversed. Defendants sought further appeal, and the court reversed and held that there was no actionable defamation. The court, in using the primacy model, determined that the manipulation statement in the editorial column, which alleged that plaintiff manipulated the press, was not defamatory under common law. The court further held that the defamation-by-implication claim, alleging that plaintiff purposely misled voters to get elected, was actionable defamation under common law, and that the fair comment privilege did not apply because plaintiff did not change his position. However, the court found that it was a protected expression of opinion, under Utah Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1 and 15. Accordingly, there was no actionable defamation.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the provision that transcripts of prior testimony were admissible in cases of remand for new sentencing proceedings, &sect; 76-3-207(4), was governed by the constitutional safeguards of unavailability and reliability, the transcripts were admissible in oral form only and could not be introduced into evidence as an exhibit or given to the jury to use during deliberation, and the defendant must timely object. The court held that the trial court's error was harmless. The court held that victim impact evidence, including evidence of the victim's character, evidence of the effects of the crime on the surviving family members, and evidence of the surviving members' opinions of the crime penalty hearing, was inadmissible under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-3-207(2) because it was (1) not relevant to the sentence, and (2) lacked probative force.

VI and XIV and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate pleaded guilty to first degree murder and was sentenced by a jury to death. He petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming he was denied his rights to due process, to counsel, and to confront witnesses in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VI and XIV and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The district court denied the petition and the court affirmed. After plaintiff was charged, the prosecutor took sworn statements from two witnesses without giving notice to plaintiff. The court noted that the statements were not depositions and were not used in place of personal examination, and held that they did not violate plaintiff's due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. VI and XIV. The performance of plaintiff's counsel did fall below an objective standard of reasonableness when he failed to object to the special verdict form which permitted the jury to consider together the robbery-murder factor and the pecuniary-gain factor in aggravation because it permitted plaintiff to be condemned twice for the same culpable act. However, because eliminating the pecuniary-gain question would not have changed the outcome, the court held he was not prejudiced.</SPAN></P>

The corporation alleged such acts violated Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 4. The Third District, Salt Lake County (Utah) granted summary judgment to the corporation and issued the injunction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court held the city council impermissibly expended and used public money. The court disagreed finding the practice did not offend art. I, &sect; 4, as the policy was presumed valid, and the corporation had the burden to prove otherwise and constitutionality was favored. The court held prayer, by its very nature, was a religious exercise. However, in the Utah Constitution's religion and conscience clauses, in light of its history, there were three complimentary themes. The themes were a distancing of government from involvement with religion, non-sectarianism to the extent there was government involvement with religion, and government neutrality. In analyzing those provisions the de minimis exception to the no public money or property sentence in art. I, &sect; 4 was rejected since any public expenditure that provided any direct benefit ran afoul of art. I, &sect; 4. The court sought a middle ground of governmental neutrality by finding money or property used was on a nondiscriminatory basis and was equally accessible. The court concluded no religious denomination dominated or interfered with city business, and there was no intent for a complete separation between religion and state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate asserted that he was not informed of the procedures by which he could have obtained advance notice of the information used against him at the parole determination hearing. He argued that none of the materials containing adverse information used at the hearing had been disclosed to him prior to the hearing. The board refused to disclose post-sentence or investigative reports and expressed concern that some of the information in its files was sensitive and required protection of potentially vulnerable informants. The court found that where confidentiality of sources was absolutely required, the board could take suitable steps to withhold the identity of sources and prepare summaries of the information for the inmate's use rather than providing copies of the actual documents. Fundamental principles of due process required the board to afford the inmate timely disclosure of the contents of their files, or reasonable summaries, prior to conducting original parole grant hearings. The court ruled that the board should grant the information to all affected inmates prospectively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, injured minors and guardians of injured minors, brought two separate actions against defendant physicians for medical malpractice. The trial courts held that the actions were time-barred by the statutes of limitations and repose provisions in the Utah Health Care Malpractice Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-14-4(2). On review of the consolidated cases, the court held that application of the statute of limitations to minors constituted a violation of equal protection under Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 24. Minors and adults were not similarly situated with regard to their ability to assert malpractice claims and &sect; 78-14-4(2) served to eliminate the substantive right of minors to bring malpractice actions when they reached emancipation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Motorist was paralyzed when his car left the road and rolled in the median in a construction area. UDOT maintained the highway, and contractor was retained to complete the repair. Although the contractor had resurfaced most of the 15 miles, it neglected to broom the right-hand outside lane near the accident site. The court determined that a reasonable jury could have determined that UDOT's negligent supervision of the project would lead to the contractor's failure to remove the excess chips in a proper fashion. Moreover, the inadequate traffic plan, in which motorists were passing each other at 55 miles per hour on a gravel-covered road, caused extreme agitation among the drivers on highway. Under those circumstances, the jury reasonably could have believed that UDOT's actions were the proximate cause of injury. In addition, the court held that motorist failed to meet his burden of proving that the limitation of recovery against UDOT to $ 250,000 infringed on a fundamental right, and the legislature was free to limit the state's liability without implicating the open courts clause and its concomitant heightened scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action by plaintiff taxpayer for recovery of taxes paid, defendants, county and tax commission (commission), appealed a judgment of the Third District, Salt Lake County (Utah) which decided that the commission wrongly denied the taxpayer's claim. The trial court decided that a prior case which declared the assessment statute to be unconstitutional was applicable to his claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer paid taxes assessed under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-5-109 (repealed) and sought recovery from the commission, which denied the request. The taxpayer then brought an action for recovery of the monies and the trial court entered partial summary judgment for the taxpayer. Defendants appealed and the court reversed the judgment below, ruling that its prior decision declaring &sect; 59-5-109 to be unconstitutional did not apply retroactively to the taxpayer's claim. The court held that when the rule involved was one of state law, the decision of prospectivity or retroactivity belonged to the state. The decision depended solely on an appraisal of the impact retroactive application had on those affected. When there was justifiable reliance on prior law, an order that a decision applied only prospectively was proper. Here, the county justifiably relied on the validity of &sect; 59-5-109 when it collected the taxes. To permit the taxpayer to recover taxes paid before the statute was declared unconstitutional placed on undue and unexpected financial burden on the county. Accordingly, the trial court was in error. Further, purely prospective application did not violate the federal constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the trial court reversing a decision of the commission, and holding that previous caselaw applied retroactively to the taxpayer's claim for recovery of taxes paid.</SPAN></P>

The city appealed, claiming that the appellate court applied an incorrect review standard and improperly undertook an independent review of the jury's findings that the drawings defendant displayed in his shop were obscene. The court affirmed the appellate court judgment, ruling that the drawings did not appeal to the prurient interest as a matter of law. Accordingly, they were not obscene and they were protected under the First Amendment. At a minimum a depiction had to be erotic in some significant way to the average person to be considered obscene. Mere nudity, including depictions of genitalia, were not, by themselves, obscene. Some express or implied action or conduct was necessary. The court also ruled that the appellate court correctly applied the strict scrutiny standard and that appellate courts had the ultimate power and were the appropriate courts to conduct an independent review of constitutional claims. The court also chose to construe the ordinance as constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 20-11-21(2)(b) did not prohibit a referendum of an ordinance enacting a new tax scheme, as well as other or alternative relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As an alternative to finding that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 20-11-21(2)(b) did not prohibit a referendum, plaintiffs sought to have the statute be declared unconstitutional under Utah Const. art. VI, &sect; 1(2). Additionally, they requested injunctive relief and an award of attorney fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1988. The city council passed an ordinance authorizing the collection of a tax on the sale and use of the services of telephone, gas, and electric utilities doing business in the city. Plaintiffs and other filed an application for copies of a referendum petition. Defendants refused to take any action on the application, premised on their conclusion that the ordinance was not subject to referral under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 20-11-21(2)(b). About seven months later, plaintiffs filed the action. Affirming, the court held that plaintiffs' failure to file timely a petition within the 30 days of the enactment of the ordinance, as required by Utah Code Ann. &sect; 20-11-24(1), precluded adjudication of the merits of their claims. The court found that the time limitation was explicit and failure to meet it was fatal to a referendum petition.</SPAN></P>

In an earlier appeal brought by the teacher, the court held that the commission could not use evidence from a sealed criminal file to prove its case for revocation. As a result, the teacher's license was reinstated. The teacher then amended his complaint to allege a violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court held that: 1) monetary damages were not available against the board, commission, or their members in their official capacities, as such were not &quot;persons&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 1983 and the reinstatement mooted the issue of injunctive relief; 2) quasi-judicial immunity applied to the members in their individual capacity, because their actions were adjudicatory in nature, revocation of licenses was likely to generate numerous lawsuits and color the members' judgment, and sufficient safeguards existed in disciplinary actions to prevent against abuse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city charged rates for electric utility service that historically resulted in a surplus, which the city transferred to its general fund to be used for general city obligations. The resident sought to enjoin the city from setting rates in excess of the cost of furnishing the service, and also claimed that the practice amounted to an unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted the city's motion, and the court affirmed the judgment, holding that the city was not prohibited by law from charging rates that exceeded the cost of the utility service, and that the city's procedure was reasonable. The actual rates were not unreasonable pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 55-3-10, which did not prohibit rates in excess of costs, but only prohibited rates from exceeding a reasonable rate. In determining that the rate was reasonable, the court cited comparisons of other cities' rates, showing that the city's rates were comparable to or lower than other rates. The court held that the resident failed to demonstrate a protectible interest in property in his claim for unconstitutional taking of property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of sexual exploitation of a minor by a jury. The trial court arrested judgment and the state appealed. The court of appeals affirmed the order because the evidence of defendants' mental state was so inherently improbable that reasonable minds could not have convicted them. On appeal, the court affirmed the order arresting judgment, holding that the correct legal standard in reviewing the trial court's order had been applied. Defendants' conviction was based on a photograph taken by a male friend that depicted their child wearing a gymnastics suit that exposed the lower part of her buttocks when she leaned over. Defendants were in the photograph but it was impossible to determine where they were looking or if they knew that their child's buttocks was exposed, so the state did not prove that defendants knowingly consented to or permitted the friend to take the photograph with intent to possess it for the purpose of his sexual arousal because knowledge that the photograph was taken did not support an inference that they knowingly permitted a photograph to be taken of their child's exposed buttocks or that they knew the friend would use it for sexual arousal.</SPAN></P>

Several of the defendants were dismissed from the lawsuit prior to trial. The manufacturer filed a motion to have the jury apportion and compare the fault of all originally named defendants, whether dismissed or present at trial, and the question was certified for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee claimed that only the fault of parties that were defendants at trial could be compared in the apportionment process. The court held that if the employer was not included in the apportionment the remaining defendants were potentially liable to the employee for an amount in excess of their proportion of fault. The exclusion of the employer from the apportionment process directly conflicted with the language of the Utah Liability Reform Act, which required that no defendant be held liable for damages in excess of its proportion of fault. The Workers' Compensation Act exclusive remedy did not bar the employer from the apportionment process because apportionment was not an action at law and would not impose any civil liability on the employer. It was not procedurally unfair for a jury to apportion the fault of the nonparty employer because it was to be given notice and an opportunity to appear under the Utah Liability Reform Act. The railroad was dismissed due to a determination of lack of fault as a matter of law. The railroad's exclusion from apportionment would not subject the remaining defendants to liability for damages in excess of their proportionate fault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury could apportion the fault of the employers notwithstanding their immunity under the workers' compensation law, but could not apportion the fault of a party that was dismissed from the lawsuit pursuant to adjudication on the merits of the liability issue.</SPAN></P>

In its application, the corporation asserted that it was both a religious institution and a charitable institution, exempt from sales tax under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-12-104(8).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation contended that the commission erred in determining that it was not a religious institution within the meaning of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-12-104(8). In its opening brief, it asserted that the actions of the commission violated the United States and Utah Constitutions and served to impede the ability of the corporation and its members to express and exercise their religious beliefs by denying it a sales tax exemption. On appeal, the court found no error in the commission's denial. The court found that the corporation was originally organized as a nonprofit corporation to operate an auxiliary church school industry. The court found that the corporation used the sales tax exemption of the La Verkin church of which it was an auxiliary. The court found that, after its severance from the church in 1988, it did not change the basic nature of its purpose and operation. The court found that the corporation represented to the commission that following the severance, the corporation continued its work &quot;with the same principles, the same aims and everything about it the same&quot;. Thus, the court held that the corporation remained an industry as before.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital homicide under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 7-5-202(1) and sentenced to death. He petitioned the trial court for a writ of habeas corpus, which was denied. Upon appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, holding that defendant's argument of prosecutorial misconduct due to comments made during his trial had been previously adjudicated and was, therefore, rejected. The court found defendant was shown no prejudice due to an amendment to the information under which he was charged because there was probable cause to support the amendment, and defendant's attorney had adequate time to prepare for the change. The court found that reasonable jurors understood and applied the instructions requiring unanimity with regard to each element of the offense. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the individual aggravating circumstances based upon both eyewitness testimony and physical evidence, that a burglary predicated on intent to kill did not merge with the crime of first degree murder, and that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of an intentional killing by means of the fire.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant waived his Miranda rights. The court upheld the trial court's decision to excuse a juror for a mental infirmity. The court held that defendant's statements concerning sodomy were properly admitted to establish the elements of aggravated kidnapping, which was itself an aggravating circumstance of first degree murder. The court held that use of testimony not disclosed to defendant did not require reversal, because a curative order was issued to the jury. The court found error in one of the jury instructions, but it concluded that the jury's finding of three other aggravating circumstances, when only one was necessary, was sufficient to support defendant's guilt conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Sixth District Court, Sevier County (Utah), which entered judgment of guilt to second degree murder pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-203, and aggravated kidnapping pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-302.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of kidnapping and second degree murder. Defendant appealed his conviction, questioning the sufficiency of the evidence, among other items. The court noted that in reviewing a jury verdict, the court viewed the evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in a light most favorable to the verdict. The state conceded, however, that the use of a second degree murder instruction that included the word &quot;recklessly&quot; amounted to plain error. The court found that Utah R. App. P. 30(b) provided that if a judgment of conviction was reversed, a new trial was to be held unless otherwise specified by the court. However, if a judgment of conviction or other order was affirmed or modified, the judgment or order affirmed or modified should be executed. Thus, the court held that while neither Utah R. Crim. P. 28 nor Utah R. App. P. 30(b) contained a provision expressly authorizing an appellate court to modify a judgment on appeal, they acknowledged the continuation of this court power. The court had the authority to modify criminal judgments on appeal and could enter judgment on a lesser included offense when an error tainted the conviction for the greater offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction for aggravated kidnapping. The court remanded the case to the trial court with directions to set aside the second degree murder verdict, to enter a judgment for reckless manslaughter, and to sentence the defendant accordingly.</SPAN></P>

The court upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty statute and the process of death qualification of the jury and found no error in the admission of evidence in either phase of trial or in the prosecutor's arguments during the penalty phase. The court held however that the trial court erred by failing to dismiss for cause one of the jurors challenged by defendant and by refusing to allow the jury to consider a possible verdict of guilty and mentally ill. The court also held that the trial court's refusal in the penalty phase to allow defendant to address the jury before it began its deliberations on the penalty verdict violated defendant's statutory right of allocution under Utah R. Crim. P. 22(a). The lead opinion was not the majority opinion as to the reversible errors. The court's holdings as to those errors were expressed in the dissenting and concurring opinions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner possessed certain lands within a drilling unit. He was a nonconsenting interest owner, that is, an owner who refused to bear his proportionate share of the drilling and operation costs. The operator had two oil and gas wells within that same drilling unit. The landowner filed a petition seeking a share of the proceeds from those wells. The board found that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-9 (Supp. 1990) did not require the operator to account for and pay the landowner a share of the proceeds because a pooling arrangement was not in place. The landowner appealed from that decision, which was affirmed. The Utah Oil and Gas Conservation Act of 1983 modified the rule of capture and sought to protect correlative rights by establishing drilling units. Therefore, &sect; 40-6-9 required that the proceeds derived from oil and gas production had to paid to all persons that were legally entitled to receive payment. However, the court found that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-6(8) (1988) required the existence of a pooling order before an operator was required to pay a nonconsenting owner. For that reason, the landowner was not permitted to invoke &sect; 40-6-9 to enforce his correlative rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appealed a decision of respondent Utah State Tax Commission, which determined that petitioner owed sales and use tax on its in-state purchases of diesel fuel and ballast, owed sales and use tax on certain services performed in Oregon, and, in the future, the Commission could assess a sales tax on the full cost of repair services petitioner performed on the railcars of other carriers. It also appealed from a penalty on underpayment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer took delivery of diesel fuel and ballast at its own railroad cars in Utah, and then transported the fuel out of the state before using it. It argued that the exemption from Utah sales tax for interstate sales provided for in Utah Admin. R. 865-19-44S applied to exempt it from liability for sales tax on the purchases. The court disagreed: under subsection A of the rule the mere fact that the taxpayer transported the fuel and ballast out of Utah did not qualify the purchases for the exemption, the purchases did not qualify for the exemption under subsection B(3) because the fuel and ballast vendors were not obligated to deliver the taxpayer's purchases outside Utah, and did not qualify under subsection C because it took delivery of the fuel and ballast as a purchaser and consumer, not as a common carrier. However, the court held that out-of-state costs to mill and drill cross-ties used in Utah were not subject to use tax under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-12-103(1)(g) because milling logs into uniform size and drilling spike holes did not involve the installation of tangible personal property and were not repairs or renovations within the meaning of section 59-12-103(g).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The assessment of sales tax on fuel and ballast purchased in state and transported out of state was affirmed. Assessment of a use tax on drilling and milling costs was reversed. The court declined to address whether the taxpayer had to collect sales tax on the full amount of repairs to other railroads' freight cars. The penalty was vacated and the case was remanded to determine whether the underpayment was negligent, intentional, or fraudulent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was assessed taxes and penalties by the State Tax Commission of Utah after he was found to have been in possession of illegal drugs. The taxpayer sought a writ of review, and the court reversed. The court found that the taxpayer's factual findings were not against the substantial weight of the evidence. The court also held that Utah's Illegal Drug Stamp Tax Act, &sect;&sect; 59-19-101 to 107, was constitutional. The court said that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague on its face because the statute gave adequate notice of a violation. The court also held that the act did not violate state or federal guarantees of equal protection because the classifications made by the act were reasonable, the objectives of the statute were legitimate, and there was a reasonable relationship between the classifications and the objectives. The court found that the statute could have been read in a way that would not have violated either the privilege against self-incrimination or U.S. Const. amend. VIII.

During an investigatory roadblock, police officers seized a one-kilogram brick of cocaine in petitioner's car. Petitioner argued that the roadblock was unconstitutional, and the evidence seized from such a roadblock should have been excluded under the tax proceeding. On appeal, the court agreed with petitioner, and reversed the tax and penalty assessment against petitioner. The court held that there was no authority by a statute or by the state constitution that authorized the police officers to conduct the suspicionless investigatory roadblock that was conducted. Next, the court concluded that petitioner's consent was not sufficiently attenuated from the prior illegality to purge the taint of the prior illegal seizure. Finally, the court held that the evidence seized should have been excluded under Utah Const. art.

On appeal, the taxpayer argued that the commission erred in finding that the taxpayer's plant manufactured products made from sheets of steel it purchased from various vendors located within and outside the state. The taxpayer also argued that the commission erred in holding that the taxpayer's installation of the tanks on a purchaser's real estate made the taxpayer a real property contractor and in assessing a penalty. The court affirmed the judgment with regard to the tax assessment, but reversed the judgment with regard to the penalty. The court held that the taxpayer was liable for the payment of sales taxes for the purchase of steel materials from state vendors in those instances where the taxpayer was in fact obligated by a sales contract to install the tanks. However, the court held that while the taxpayer did not comply with the commission's demand to pay said taxes, the court did not believe that such failure to comply constituted an &quot;intentional disregard of law or rule&quot; as that term was used in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-1-401(3)(b) (1987).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient appealed a judgment from the Seventh District Court, Grand County (Utah), which granted a summary judgment dismissing her malpractice action against defendant doctor for failure to comply in a timely manner with the prelitigation review requirements of the Utah Health Care Malpractice Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-14-12(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient consulted the doctor complaining of numbness in her face and hand. He treated her for a nervous disorder. After she suffered a seizure that led to a diagnosis of a brain tumor, she brought an action for medical negligence against the doctor. She served a notice on the doctor as required by Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-14-8. She did not file a request for a prelitigation review within 60 days after service of her first notice. She filed an amended notice followed immediately by a request for a prelitigation review. The trial court entered summary judgment for the doctor. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that the patient complied with all statutory deadlines for prelitigation review. Her failure to file a request for prelitigation review within 60 days of serving notice did not nullify the mandatory extension granted in &sect; 78-14-8. Because the patient served a notice of intent to commence action within 90 days of the expiration of the statute of limitations, she became entitled to an additional 120-day extension. The court held that a court could not bar the patient's action for failure to file a request for prelitigation review within 60 days of that notice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that the statute of limitations barred the patient's malpractice action against the doctor. The court remanded for reinstatement of the complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, husband and wife, appealed the decision of respondent, Utah State Tax Commission, which affirmed an amended audit against them $ 344,419 in unpaid income taxes, penalties, and interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners argued that the tax commission erred in affirming the amount of income tax deficiency, holding the wife liable for the assessed tax, and affirming the penalty for fraud with intent to evade taxes. The court held that the husband was required to file federal income tax returns, per 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 6012, and Utah Code Ann.&nbsp;&sect; 59-14A-48 (1974); &sect; 59-10-502 (1987), but the amount of tax assessed lacked substantial evidence because it pertained to gross sales, not for gross profit. The court also held that there was no finding that the wife earned income during the period in question. Petitioners argued an error in assessing the 100 percent penalty for fraud because there was no evidence of their dishonest intent to evade. The court held that the commission's finding of fraud against the husband for the years in question was adequately supported by the evidence but limited to the years 1978 to 1986. Petitioners argued for the first time on appeal that the confiscation of their property under a jeopardy assessment was a violation of due process but the court held that the argument was rejected as untimely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was reversed in part, and the matter was remanded for further proceedings. The court vacated the assessment against the wife and affirmed the finding against the husband.</SPAN></P>

After defendant had been sentenced, Utah Code Ann &sect;&sect; 76-3-201 and 207 was enacted to provide for the possibility of life without parole. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in issuing the new death warrant, as it effectively resentenced him without considering the option of life without parole. The court held that the trial court did not resentence defendant but simply evaluated the legal cause for proceeding with the sentence. Moreover, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-3-207.5 provided that the option of life without parole was not available for persons, such as defendant, who were sentenced prior to the enactment of &sect;&sect; 76-3-201 and 207. Defendant argued that the execution of the sentence 18 years after the conviction constituted cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The court held that the sentence was not cruel and unusual under either the state or federal standards, as the crime was particularly brutal; the five victims were tied down, forced to drink liquid Drano, and were shot in the head. Moreover, two victims survived.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff subdividers sought review of an order of the Third District Court, Salt Lake County (Utah), which granted partial summary judgment to defendant municipality on plaintiffs' claim for refunds of impact fees that they paid to defendant, pursuant to West Jordan, Utah, Ordinance 33, &sect; 9-C-8(a) (1975), to be used for flood control and parks and recreation facilities. Defendant argued that the claims were barred by statutes of limitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subdividers filed a class action suit against defendant to have West Jordan, Utah, Ordinance 33, &sect; 9-C-8(a) (1975), which provided that impact fees were to be paid to defendant, declared unconstitutional. Subsequently, plaintiff subdividers filed suit against defendant for a refund of the impact fees they had paid to defendant. Eight years later, the court in the first action denied class certification and declared the ordinance unconstitutional. Defendant then filed a motion for partial summary judgment against plaintiffs, arguing that their action was barred by various statutes if limitation. The trial court granted the motion, and plaintiffs sought review. The court reversed as to all but one plaintiff. The Utah Governmental Immunity Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 63-30-13 to -15, did not apply to the action because the action for refunds was equitable in nature, and there was an exception to governmental immunity for equitable claims. The commencement of a class action and appeal of the denial of the class action by the trial court in the previous suit tolled the statute of limitations found in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-12-31, and it did not run again until class certification was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the grant of summary judgment for defendant municipality as to all but one of plaintiff subdividers. The limitations period on plaintiffs' action was tolled for the period of time that a previous class action concerning refunds for subdividers, after a law requiring that impact fees be paid to defendant was declared unconstitutional, was pending, and the period did not begin to run again until denial of class certification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mineral interest owner sought review of respondent Utah State Board of Oil, Gas, and Mining's action modifying a 1981 order. He asked whether a statutory non-consent penalty was unconstitutional and inconsistent with the public interest in the Utah Oil and Gas Conservation Act, whether the Board could modify a forced pooling order, and whether a 1985 order required respondent operator to show economic feasibility for a second well.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator petitioned the Board to enter a new order or to modify the 1981 order to lay out the costs the mineral owner was required to pay as a result of the second well. The new order required the mineral owner to pay his share of 100 percent of the costs of surface equipment beyond the wellhead and the operating costs, and 175 percent of the costs of drilling, completing, and equipping the well. The owner objected to the 75 percent non-consent penalty for some of the costs. The court held that the imposition of a statutory non-consent penalty was consistent with the declaration of public interest contained in the Utah Oil and Gas Conservation Act (Act) and was not unconstitutional as a taking or a violation of due process. The court also found that the Act did not explicitly authorize the Board to modify a pooling order; such an authorization was implied in the Act's grant of authority to the Board to modify drilling orders to that effect. The court remanded the cause to the Board for a finding of whether the 1985 order required the operator to make a showing of economic feasibility to the Board before drilling a second well and, if so, whether the showing was made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the Board's 1990 action modifying the 1981 order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners brought suit alleging that they each had a one-half interest in the water rights to property owned by the town. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the town. On appeal, the court affirmed the order. The court held that the property owners did not have water rights in land owned by the town because the town was barred, as a municipality, from conveying its water interest to the property owners' successor pursuant to Utah Const. art. XI, &sect; 6. The court held that because the town was a municipality, the constitutional prohibition superseded Utah Code Ann. &sect; 73-1-11, which provided that water rights passed to the grantee at the time of conveyance unless they were expressly reserved by grantor. The court determined that the trial court was correct in holding that the property owners had a valid water right under their 1983 application to appropriate water with the state engineer but that the rights were subject to the senior rights of the town. The court held that town did not forfeit its water rights under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 73-1-4 because its use, although unconstitutional, did not &quot;cease&quot; and was applied to a beneficial purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff husband filed a tort action against defendant physician for alienation of affections and criminal conversation.

The court affirmed the order of the trial court sustaining the tort of alienation of affections and held that the allegations in the complaint stated that defendant's acts were the controlling cause of the breakup of the marriage.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dog owners' dogs were pit bull terriers, a breed subject to regulation by the ordinance, which imposed special licensing, confinement, muzzling, and insurance requirements for dogs classified as &quot;fierce, dangerous, or vicious.&quot; On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that the ordinance was constitutional. The court held that the trial court's finding that a dog's breed was determined by predominant physical characteristics was not clearly erroneous because it was supported by substantial evidence such as the registration process for a purebred dog. The court found that the ordinance was not void-for-vagueness on its face because the ordinance was not vague in all of its possible applications. The ordinance was not vague in its application to dog owners as their dogs' breed was named in the ordinance and the city provided an administrative remedy to clarify whether dogs were of a breed subject to the ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer challenged the final decision of respondent Utah State Tax Commission (commission) ordering him to pay a $ 1,000-per-year penalty for failing to file tax returns during the years 1978 to 1983. The taxpayer argued that the penalty required a showing of fraudulent intent and that there was not evidence that he had such an intent to evade the tax or filing requirement, as required by Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-14A-92(5) (Supp. 1986).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was ordered by the commission to file state income tax returns for the years 1977 to 1983 within 30 days in August 1984. The taxpayer failed to meet subsequent extensions. However, he hired an accountant to reconstruct past tax records. After a writ of mandate issued, the taxpayer again failed to meet certain deadlines. Finally in 1986, the taxpayer filed the requested tax returns. Subsequently, the commission, acting under authority of &sect; 59-14A-92(5), imposed a $ 1,000 penalty on the taxpayer for the late filing of each return, contending that the taxpayer acted with the intent to evade the filing requirement. The commission reasoned that the taxpayer's conduct and the lack of proper record keeping provided sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that he had no intention of filing during the years in question. The court reversed the assessment of the penalty and held that the penalty imposed under &sect; 59-14A-92(5) was a fraud penalty and that the commission had failed to show that the taxpayer fraudulently intended to avoid the requirements of the Utah Tax Act. The court further noted that it was possible that the taxpayer was liable for some lesser penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the commission, which ordered the taxpayer to pay a $ 1,000-per-year penalty for failing to file tax returns during the years 1978 to 1983 and found that there was no evidence of fraudulent intent to evade the tax or filing requirement on the part of the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners argued that it was error to let the jury determine whether the taking was necessary, to value their property on the date they were served with the condemnation summons, and to deny them the opportunity to admit evidence regarding the existence of minerals on their property. The court found that because the trial court permitted both parties to fully present and litigate the issue of the necessity of the proposed taking at the hearing on the motion for an order of immediate occupancy and entered written findings of fact sustaining the municipality's right to condemn, the property owners were not entitled to relitigate the issue at trial. The court determined that the issuance of the summons was the proper date on which to determine the value of the property pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-34-11 (1987). The court found that the property owners should have been permitted to give evidence as to the existence of mineral deposits on their property and the enhanced value of the property that resulted from those minerals. The court reasoned that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-34-2 permitted the value of minerals to be used in determining just compensation.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the taxpayer, through its activities in conducting the operations of the pipeline and compressors, had a substantial nexus with the state. Therefore, the gas used to fuel those compressors was subject to Utah's use tax under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-12-103(1)(c) (1987 &amp; Supp. 1991) and Utah Code Admin.

The court affirmed the determination of the commission that these expenditures were not exempt from sales and use tax. The court found that the corporation's production facility did not qualify for the exemption under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-12-104(15), because it produced synthetic fuels. The court determined that the legislature, in enacting Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-12-104(15), intended to grant an exemption for materials used in the construction of the type of plant which removed impurities form natural resources to produce a liquid or gaseous material meant to be used in combustion for the production of energy. Therefore, the commission did not err in its determination of non-exemption under &sect; 59-12-104(15).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment for the Eighth Circuit, Uintah County (Utah), which convicted him of assaulting a peace officer under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-102.4 (1990) and of interfering with a peace officer under Utah Code Ann. 76-8-305 (1990), arising out of an incident in which defendant refused to permit an officer to conduct a search of the premises where a party was in progress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court found a general common law citizen's right to forcibly resist an illegal search or arrest could not be implied, in light of the legislature's enactment of various specific and varied statutory defenses. There was sufficient evidence to find that defendant had assaulted a peace officer while that officer was attempting to conduct a search in the course of a criminal investigation and then effect an arrest. Defendant was aware of the officer's attempt to place him under arrest, but proceeded to strike the officer. The evidence amply supported the trial court's conclusion that the officer was acting within the scope of his authority as a police officer, and the fact that the officer's attempted search was later found to be unlawful did not divest him of his authority. Because no place of habitation was involved, only a place of business, by its terms Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-2-405 (1990) had no application. The court held that the actions of law enforcement officers taken within the course of their duties were not within the category of criminal intrusions that may be lawfully resisted under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-2-406 (1990).</SPAN></P>

Over five months later, the individual was arrested and the van was seized pursuant to &sect; 58-37-13. On review, the individual contended in part that &sect; 58-37-13 did not permit a warrantless forfeiture under the circumstances of the case, and that the warrantless seizure of the van invalidated the forfeiture proceedings. Reversing, the court held (1) that the State's contention that it had probable cause to believe that the van had been used in violation of the Controlled Substances Act and that the seizure was therefore authorized by &sect; 58-37-13(2)(d), even though the State had no warrant, was without merit, as a fair reading of the probable cause exception in &sect; 58-37-13(2)(d) was that probable cause had to be accompanied by exigent circumstances for a warrantless seizure to be permissible; and (2) that because the seizure was illegal, the district court had no jurisdiction to declare a forfeiture of the van.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers challenged the judgment from the District Court, Third District, Salt Lake County (Utah) that granted the appellee tax collectors' motion for summary judgment as to the taxpayer's constitutional challenge under Utah Const. art. XIII, &sect; 5, against the levy imposed by Utah Code Ann. &sect; 17-19-15. The district court held that the taxpayers lacked standing, and certified its order for appeal under Utah R. Civ. P. 54(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers raised three constitutional challenges, but the district court granted the tax collectors' partial summary judgment only on the claim brought under Utah Const. art. XIII, &sect; 5. In dismissing the appeal, the court did not address the substantive issue but rather its jurisdiction over the interlocutory appeal of a certified question under Utah R. Civ. P. 54(b). The court focused on the second criteria, finality, required under rule 54(b) for an appeal of one but not all issues. Because rule 54(b) was taken from the federal procedural rules, the court looked to federal decisions interpreting &quot;finality.&quot; Of the two existing federal approaches, the court adopted that used by the Seventh Circuit, rather than the Second Circuit, because of its more narrow approach to certification, even though it did not limit availability of interlocutory appeals, and because it gave the appellate courts more control over their dockets. Thus, under the &quot;factual overlap&quot; approach the court held that because the facts relevant to Utah Const. art. XIII, &sect; 5, overlapped the facts relevant to the other challenges it would have been a waste of judicial resources to address the issued appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the appeal filed by the taxpayers because the district court erroneously certified its interlocutory order as appealable. Under the analytical approach the grant of partial summary judgment on the taxpayers' constitutional challenge was not final when the relevant facts for that issue overlapped with the taxpayers' other theories still pending before the district court.</SPAN></P>

She argued that whether a drug was &quot;unavoidably unsafe&quot; must be determined on a case-by-case basis, with a determination in each case of whether the specific drug's benefit exceeded its risk at the time it was distributed. The court held, in answering the certified question, that a drug approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), properly prepared, compounded, packaged, and distributed, could not as a matter of law be &quot;defective&quot; in the absence of proof of inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, or fraudulent information furnished by the manufacturer in connection with FDA approval. The court acknowledged that by characterizing all FDA-approved prescription medications as &quot;unavoidably unsafe,&quot; they were expanding the literal interpretation of the treatise section.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that a broad grant of immunity from strict liability claims based on design defects should be extended to FDA-approved prescription drugs in Utah. The public policy of supporting the research and development of new drugs required a holding that the FDA-approved prescription medication was an &quot;unavoidably unsafe product.&quot; Therefore, manufacturers of those drugs would not be liable for a claim based on defective design.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The acquiring corporation was formed to consolidate a family's 14 acquired corporations into a manageable structure and to equally redistribute ownership after divorce settlements. The state tax auditors disallowed over $ 300,000 in tax deductions in the form of the acquired corporations' loss carryovers on the acquiring corporation's consolidated tax return. The Commission upheld the auditors' decisions and denied the petition for redetermination based upon its interpretation of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-7-108. After determining that the correction-of-error standard of review applied, the court reversed the Commission's decision and remanded. By the plain terms of &sect; 59-7-108(14)(f), the acquired corporations were not prohibited from deducting their preacquisition losses merely because their stock had been purchased by another entity. The acquired corporations did not fit within the statute's specific prohibitions and could deduct the preacquisition losses from their own income. While the filing of a consolidated tax return created a single taxing unit, each acquired corporation retained its own identity and deductions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to the adoption of the statute, each county funded its own costs incurred in the imposition and collection of ad valorem property taxes. Under the statute, each county determined the county's costs and submitted them to the state auditor. The auditor was to review each budget and certify that they complied with approved categories of cost. Any revenue collected by a county under the local levy in excess of its approved budget was to be transmitted to the state treasurer for redistribution to counties having tax collection budget shortfalls. Defendant county was awarded summary judgment against the company's action for declaratory relief and recovery of taxes. Affirming, the court held that a state purpose was served because the tax financed the assessment, collection, and distribution of ad valorem property taxes in each county, ensuring that local county taxing authorities had sufficient funds to perform their duties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated robbery in the Third District Court of Salt Lake County (Utah), after the prosecution introduced evidence of an eye witness identification of the defendant that was made shortly after the robbery, against which the defendant had requested a motion to suppress that was not ruled upon by the trial court. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that he was seized and searched in violation of the United States and Utah Constitutions and that an eyewitness identification of him was inadmissible as a consequence of the illegal seizure and was unconstitutionally suggestive and unreliable. The court vacated the conviction and remanded for new trial, holding that the conflicting testimony of the officers showed that the seizure of defendant was questionable in that there was no testimony by the officers showing articulable facts that would justify the officers seizing defendant, who was handcuffed to a fence when a witness identified him. The court further held that Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 7, applied a more stringent standard to establish the reliability of an eyewitness identification for admissibility than did U.S. Const. amend. XIV and the trial court failed to make factual findings required by Utah R. Crim. P. 12(c) to support the stop made by the officer, who first contacted defendant and who had testified that he was unaware that a robbery had taken place at the time that he stopped defendant, which violated Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 14, and Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-7-15.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's conviction and remanded to the trial court for a new trial, because the trial court had failed to make the required factual findings to support the admissibility of the eyewitness identification of defendant as one of the robbers and the police officers' testimony was sufficiently conflicting to require the trial court to make the required fact findings.</SPAN></P>

The court found that 1) the mere fact that the bar association was created by statute did not make it a state agency; 2) the bar association did not exist to participate in the government of the state, but to provide professional advice to those with the ultimate responsibility of governing the legal profession; and 3) because the trial court's ruling was reversed, the attorney was not entitled to attorney fees or exemplary damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">UDOT followed the proper procedures in condemning the landowners' properties by serving each landowner with a summons, tendering into court approved appraisals for each piece of property, and securing uncontested orders of occupancy.

The trial judge ordered each of the dates of valuation for the properties changed from the dates summonses were served to June 22, 1977. On appeal the court reversed, holding that: (1) the property owners waived the right to challenge the date of valuation because they withdrew the funds deposited by UDOT without taking some affirmative action to preserve their challenge and (2) the trial court erred in ruling that interest would be computed from June 22, 1977 because the basis for the ruling was the trial court's resolution of the valuation date claim, which was waived by the property owners.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the admission of the crash-test films was not an abuse of discretion; the films were relevant and depicted vehicles with substantially similar handling characteristics. Any differences between the conditions of the tests and the accident went to the weight of the evidence. However, the automobile manufacturers' cross-examination of the driver and passenger's expert witnesses was improperly limited. The automobile manufacturers should have been allowed to inquire into the experts' comparisons of the driver's vehicle with other vehicles, as well as into the basis of the experts' opinions. Several films and exhibits offered by the automobile manufacturers were improperly excluded; they were admissible because they directly rebutted the driver and passenger's assertions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county appealed from a summary judgment of the Third District, Salt Lake County (Utah), against it on its counterclaim to recover taxes from plaintiff mining company for under-assessed or unassessed mining properties, and on its cross-claim against cross-claim defendant State Tax Commission for an order directing the commission to adopt assessment procedures for mining companies that did not violate Utah Const. art. XIII, &sect;&sect; 2 and 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county's counterclaim and cross-claim alleged that company's mining properties and equipment, which had been assessed according to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-5-57 (Supp. 1981), were undervalued and not assessed at the constitutionally mandated &quot;full cash value&quot; or &quot;value in money&quot; required by Utah Const. art. XIII, &sect; 3. The county sought to recover taxes for under-assessed or unassessed mining properties for a five-year period. The court first rejected the company's contention that Utah Const. art. XIII, &sect;&sect; 2 and 3, did not apply to the assessment of mines because, if the provisions did not apply, the taxation of mines could be wholly arbitrary and discriminatory. The valuation formula and the procedures used to implement it had to conform to art. XIII, &sect;&sect; 2 and 3, and the county was entitled to show at a trial on the merits that the statute was unconstitutional. As to the issue that might arise on remand, whether the county would recover back taxes from the company if the statutory formula had produced an unconstitutional assessment, the court noted that the county would have to show that unassessed or under-assessed property &quot;escaped assessment&quot; and was not just &quot;undervalued.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged his commitment to prison rather than to a mental hospital, as well as the jury instructions on appeal. The court affirmed. The court held that defendant was not able to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he should have been sentenced to the state hospital because he failed to satisfy Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-35-21.5(4)(b) (Supp. 1988) because his mental illness had not posed an immediate physical danger to himself or others.

The taxpayer had unsuccessfully sought a 20 percent reduction of the assessed fair market cash value of its properties under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-5-4.5 (1953 &amp; Supp. 1986). The Tax Commission had assessed the properties at 100 percent under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-5-1 (Supp. 1986).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer extracted magnesium from the waters of a Utah lake. The taxpayer obtained its concentrated brine solution principally from a series of evaporation ponds located along the shores of the lake and close to a plant. Although the taxpayer owned the plant, the evaporation ponds were located on land owned by the State of Utah and the federal government. The taxpayer paid a royalty to the State for the nonexclusive right to extract minerals from the lake. The Tax Commission assessed the taxpayer as a mining operation pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 59-5-3 and 59-5-1 (1953 &amp; Supp. 1986). On review, the taxpayer contended in part that by requiring the State to assess property at 100 percent of value under &sect; 59-5-1 and the county to assess property at 80 percent of value under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-5-4.5, the Utah legislature had created a law that violated &sect;&sect; 2 and 3 of article XIII of the Utah Constitution. Reversing, the court held that assuming the legislature was correct in determining that the market appraisal method overvalued property by 20 percent, it was unconstitutional to apply Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-5-4.5 to county-assessed properties and not to state-assessed properties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contracted with the city to construct a golf course. Thereafter, plaintiff brought an action against defendants alleging that the state and the company negligently allowed the coffer dams to remain in place after defendant company's project was completed, thus damming the water and causing the water level to rise and flood the area of construction of the golf course. The state filed a motion for summary judgment, and the trial court granted the motion. The court reversed holding that that the second paragraph of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-3 provided only a qualified immunity to governmental entities engaged in flood-related activities. The court held that in amending &sect; 63-30-3, the legislature only intended to clarify flood control activities as governmental functions, thus bringing those activities within the Governmental Immunity Act. Thus, the second paragraph of &sect; 63-30-3 was subject to the waiver provisions found in the Governmental Immunity Act. The court concluded that if the legislature had intended to provide absolute immunity to the state, it would not have placed such an exception in a section that had always granted only qualified immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner alleged that the county damaged improvements on his property during the implementation of a flood control program. The landowner brought actions for inverse condemnation under Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 22 and for damages. The lower court granted the county's motion to dismiss. The court reversed the decision of the lower court. The court held that while Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-3 of the Governmental Immunity Act (Act), Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 63-30-1 to -38 (1989), was applicable, it was unclear whether Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-3 conferred absolute or qualified immunity. The Act's legislative history, the Act's existing framework, the Act's policy, and the need to harmonize the 1984 amendments with the logic and structure of the Act, all supported the conclusion that &sect; 63-30-3 provided qualified immunity for the county's flood control decisions. Further, the issue of whether the county's actions were discretionary, and thus entitled to immunity under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-10(1)(a), was remanded. Finally, the landowner might recover for damages caused by the county's discretionary actions because governmental immunity did not apply to an inverse condemnation action.</SPAN></P>

Without obtaining a warrant, the police opened the car's unlocked door in search of the additional vehicle identification number (VIN) to verify the VIN located on the dashboard. When the police identified the car as stolen, defendant was arrested for theft and possession of a stolen car. On certiorari, the court reversed. After finding that the theft could not have been committed without possession and that a greater-lesser relationship had existed between the specific variations of the crimes, the court held the possession was the lesser-included offense of the theft, and thus, defendant could not have been convicted of both crimes. Moreover, because defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the VIN located inside the car and exigent circumstances did not justify a warrantless search, the court held the search had been illegal. Therefore, the court held any evidence obtained in the illegal search should have been excluded as a necessary consequence of violating Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 14.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment based on Utah Code Ann. &sect; 70A-2-725. On interlocutory appeal, the court stated that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 70A-2-725 did not apply to an action for personal injury or personal property damage, unless the latter was recoverable as consequential damages for breach of a contract or sales warranty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was subject to the provisions of &sect; 59-15-5.1, which required prepayment of a portion of its sales tax liability. The taxpayer filed a late return and, because the prepayment amount was $ 92,874, the commission imposed an assessment for $ 9,287, representing a 10 percent penalty on the entire amount due. The taxpayer sought judicial review, claiming that the penalty should be computed on a daily basis, not on a flat rate basis, and because the return was only 38 days late, the penalty should be only about $ 967. In affirming, the court ruled that the plain language in &sect; 59-15-5.1(3) that the penalty was 10 percent of &quot;the total amount of the prepayment due,&quot; together with other language that allowed for an interest charge, meant that a flat charge was imposed, not an apportionable interest charge based on the number of days the return was late. Moreover, the clause &quot;due from the date the prepayment return is due&quot; in &sect; 59-15-5.1(3) was not intended to create an interest charge. Instead, the clause was intended to indicate when the penalty would be assessed. The language being plain and clear, the statute was not so vague as to violate due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile when he committed the crimes, was certified for prosecution as an adult.

On appeal he contended that the sentences constituted cruel and unusual punishment because he was a juvenile at the time of the crimes. The court affirmed the sentences, ruling that once certified as an adult, defendant had to accept exposure to adult punishment. The mandatory minimum sentences did not violate the federal or state constitutions and they were not cruel and unusual in light of the horrific nature of the crimes. Further, the firearms enhancement was proper under the expanded scope of &sect; 76-3-203(1). The trial court also did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant at the highest end of the sentencing scheme.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessor had leased a portion of land from which he was extracting minerals, and upon which he had dug an underground canal. The railroad had a causeway across the adjoining lake. Because of the rapid rise of the water level in the lake, the State authorized the breaching of the causeway. After the lessor's preliminary injunction was denied, the causeway was breached, which caused the destruction of the canal and made it impossible for the lessor to extract minerals. The court determined that it would not review evidence outside the pleadings. The court held that the lessor had a property interest in the canal. The court held that the lessor had alleged a permanent interference with the use of the canal, which constituted a taking pursuant to Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 22, and that the fact that the taking may have been a legitimate exercise of police power did not relieve the State from making just compensation. The court held that there were fact issues as to whether the State was acting under an emergency or in furtherance of public trust.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner argued that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 11-13-27 (1986) (amended 1987) was unconstitutional in that it required petitioner to obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity from the Commission before constructing a transmission line and that such a requirement violated Utah Const. art. VI, &sect; 28, which prevented any &quot;special commission&quot; from having authority over &quot;municipal functions.&quot; When petitioner applied for the certificate, the Commission denied the request based on expense, location, and the ability of a competitor to provide some of the same service. The court affirmed on appeal. The court held that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 11-13-27 (1986) (amended 1987) was constitutional. It did not violate Utah Const. art. VI, &sect; 28 because (1) petitioner was not a municipality but a collection of cities, town, and agencies; and (2) the construction of the line was not a &quot;municipal function.&quot; The court found that the construction of the line was sufficiently infused with a state, as opposed to an exclusively local, interest to escape characterization as a municipal function.

He then appealed to the Utah Court of Appeals, which dismissed the appeal. Under Utah. R. Crim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed summary judgment in favor of the architects and builders, based on Utah's statute of repose, because Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-12-25.5 (Supp. 1989) had been held unconstitutional by the court as measured against Utah. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The architects and builders settled with the golfer and were dismissed from the appeal. The golf course objected to their dismissal, arguing that if the court reversed the summary judgment that was granted in its favor, the judgment that dismissed its cross-claim for contribution should have also been reversed, and the other defendants should have continued as parties at a trial on remand. The court reversed the summary judgment awarded to the golf course because there were genuine dispute of material facts with respect to its negligence. The court also reversed the order that dismissed the golf course's cross-claim against the architects and builders, which cross-claim was also improperly based on the unconstitutional stature of repose.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a suit against defendant for alleged violations of the Motor Fuel Marketing Act (Act), Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 13-16-1 to -9. Plaintiff charged that defendant violated the Act by offering to sell fuel below cost in certain areas in Utah. Plaintiff sought a restraining order to prevent further below-cost sales by defendant. The court issued an order and scheduled a hearing. Defendant opposed the injunction on the ground that the Act's ban on below-cost sales violated the due process clause. The court denied the injunction and found the Act denied defendant due process. Plaintiff's suit was dismissed. On appeal, the court held legislative enactments were endowed with strong presumptions of validity and would not be declared unconstitutional unless there was no basis they could conform to constitutional requirements. The court determined the Act's ban on below-cost sales did not violate the due process clause and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

Even assuming that the prosecutor's comment was a misstatement of the evidence, the court found that the comment did not affect defendant's substantial rights. The court also found that defendant was properly charged with aggravated sexual assault rather than rape or forcible sexual abuse. The court determined that there was no error in the trial court's refusal to allow argument and failure to instruct the jury on defendant's potential sentence. The court found no error or misstatement of law with respect to the court's instruction on penalty.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a full-blooded American Indian, sought review of a decision of the Seventh Judicial District Court, San Juan County (Utah), which denied plaintiff's challenge to the jury that was selected on the grounds that the challenge was not made timely as required by Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-46-16 (1987) and because the challenge was unsupported by any statistics and affidavits necessary to support a valid objection under the Sixth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contended American Indians were under-represented on the jury that was selected to try her personal injury case. The record showed that plaintiff's counsel made an unsupported and vague oral objection regarding the composition of the jury. The court determined that the trial court erred in denying plaintiff's challenge under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-46-16 (1987), which barred any challenge not made before the trial jury was sworn. It appeared that plaintiff objected to the jury selection prior to the swearing of the jury and that the jury was passed for cause only with the reservation that plaintiff's challenge could be made later. However, the court determined that the error was harmless because plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case under the Sixth Amendment. The mere observation that a particular group was underrepresented on a particular panel did not support a constitutional challenge. Plaintiff failed to demonstrate or contend that there was any underrepresentation of American Indians in the qualified jury wheel from which jurors were selected. Additionally, an objection had to be supported by affidavits and statistics, not by counsel's bald assertions.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed that the injured party's action was barred by the two-year limitations period. The court examined whether the six-year period in &sect; 78-15-3 was a statute of limitations or a statute of repose. Because the time period in &sect; 78-15-3 had not begun to run from the date of injury, but had begun to run from the date of purchase or manufacture, and because the legislative intent was to control the product liability exposure for businesses, the court concluded that &sect; 78-15-3 was a statute of repose, not a special statute of limitations for product liability actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business owners brought an action against the city for damages they sustained as a result of a flood. The business owners alleged that the city negligently mismanaged the floodwaters. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the construction, operation, and maintenance of the city drainage system was a government function and was covered under the Governmental Immunity Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-3 (Supp. 1983, 1989). The city did not expressly waive immunity under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-10(1) (Supp. 1983, amended 1989) because the design, capacity, and construction of the drainage system was a discretionary function of the city. The court also found no merit to the business owner's claim that the city allegedly committed an inverse taking of the business owner's property. However, on the issue of alleged negligent operation and maintenance of the drainage system, the court held that if proven, the city was not immune.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile appealed his conviction from the Fourth District, Millard County (Utah), of attempted second degree murder, and aggravated robbery and the dual sentences imposed. The principal issues on appeal were (1) whether intent was an element of proof of attempted second degree felony-murder, and (2) whether the statutory procedure which permitted the prosecution of juveniles as adults was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 17-year-old shot a service station attendant in the head, but she did not die. He robbed the service station and told another youth involved, who was waiting outside, that he had shot the attendant and he thought she was dead. On appeal of the convictions and sentences, the court held that the crime of attempted murder did not fit within the felony-murder doctrine because an attempt to commit a crime required proof of an intent to consummate the crime, and the crime of attempted murder required proof of intent to kill. Thus the court held that attempted felony-murder did not exist as a crime in Utah. The juvenile also challenged the constitutionality of the statutory provisions which permitted his prosecution as an adult. He contended that the procedure violated rights to due process and equal protection of the law afforded by both federal and state constitutions. The court concluded that the legislature doubtless considered both the rise in the number of crimes committed by juveniles as well as the growing recidivist rate among this group and was entitled to determine that certain juveniles should, through the proper exercise of discretion, be prosecuted as adults.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the juvenile's convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant regularly took his five-year-old son and his three-year-old daughter on visitation at the same time. After one visitation, the daughter's mother noticed that the girl's vaginal area was inflamed. The mother contacted the authorities. At defendant's trial, a social worker testified that, on the basis of his interviews with the two children, the son had simulated intercourse with the daughter. The son denied telling anyone that defendant made him lie on the daughter. Defendant was convicted of sexual abuse of a child for unlawfully touching the genitalia of his daughter and for causing his son to take indecent liberties with the daughter. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction for causing the son to take indecent liberties. The court held that social worker's uncorroborated, unsworn hearsay statement was insufficient to convict defendant when later repudiated at trial. Defendant's conviction for unlawfully touching his daughter's genitalia was affirmed because any error in the admission of expert testimony was harmless. Further, the child abuse hearsay statute,&nbsp;Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-411(2), provided sufficient boundaries to allow a judge to fairly administer the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During defendant's trial for child sexual abuse, expert witnesses' testimony regarding the out-of-court statements of the child victims was admitted into evidence. Defendant's counsel failed to object to the statements or to challenge their admissibility. Defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual abuse of a child, in violation of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-404.1 (Supp. 1988) (amended 1989), and of sodomy upon a child, in violation of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-403.1 (Supp. 1987) (amended 1988). Defendant challenged his convictions and claimed that the admission of the victims' out-of-court statements was plain error and that his trial counsel was ineffective. The lower court affirmed defendant's convictions and held that defense counsel's failure to object was an affirmative waiver of an objection and was the result of a conscious trial strategy. Therefore, the plain error doctrine was inapplicable. Further, defendant did not demonstrate that his representation by defense counsel fell below an objective standard of reasonable professional judgment. The court held that defendant was precluded by Utah R. Evid. 103(a)(1) from raising any of his evidentiary points on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment finding the corporate signatory liable for signing the checks. The court found it unlikely that the legislature intended to subject innocent employees to personal liability. The corporate signatory had no interest in the checking account, and had no knowledge or reason to believe that the checks were drawn on insufficient funds. If Utah Code Ann. &sect; 7-15-1 (1988) imposed strict liability, it would be inconsistent with Utah Code Ann. &sect; 70A-3-403 (1980), which allowed for extrinsic evidence to aid in determining the personal liability of the signatory to a check. However, for the statutes to be construed as mutually consistent, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 7-15-1 (1988) could not be construed as imposing strict liability.</SPAN></P>

The defendants filed motions for summary judgment. The designer and builder contended that the action against it was barred by Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-12-25.5 (1977), which prohibits suits against architects and builders brought more than seven years after the completion of the building. The district court certified the question to the Court. The wrongful death claim settled, and the open courts issue remained.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A portion of the taxpayer's property was condemned in order to widen a road. When the tax assessment records were changed to reflect the condemnation, the legal description of the property was correct, but the size of the lot was understated by three acres due to a typographical error. The taxpayer's property taxes were calculated based upon the error. The board, without notice or a hearing, reviewed and corrected the property valuation and issued a reassessment, and that decision was reversed by the commission. On appeal from the commission's ruling, the court noted that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-2-309(1) (Supp. 1989) permitted reassessment of property that &quot;escaped assessment.&quot; The court then held that the taxpayer's property did not &quot;escape assessment.&quot; The computational error resulted from the inaccurate representation of the number of acres, not an omission in the description of the property subject to assessment. Therefore, the property was assessed, albeit inaccurately. The court concluded that &sect; 59-2-309(1) did not permit retroactive correction of the mistaken valuation after the tax was paid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the First District Court, Cache County (Utah), which sentenced him to two terms of 1 to 15 years for the two counts of sexual abuse of a child and one minimum mandatory term of 10 years to life for the offense of sodomy on a child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was convicted of sexual abuse of a child and sodomy on a child, contended that the trial court abused its discretion in denying him probation and in sentencing him to a 10-year minimum mandatory term. The court affirmed the judgment. The court concluded that the trial court had properly considered the requirements of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-406.5(2) and the factors enumerated in &sect; 76-5-406.5(1)(a) - (l) and, considering the factors in aggravation, did not abuse its discretion in denying probation. In addition, the court determined that for the offense of sodomy on a child, defendant could not receive probation or reduction of sentence under the requirements of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-3-406. Because the trial court had identified and weighed the factors in sentencing defendant to a 10-year minimum mandatory term as required by Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-3-201(5) &amp; (6), the court found no abuse of discretion in applying the middle severity minimum sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court was an action by petitioner, Salt Lake County (Utah), by and through the Board of Equalization of Salt Lake County, State of Utah, against respondent, the Utah Transit Authority (UTA). The County sought review of a decision by the Utah State Tax Commission, which had overruled the Board and held that the UTA was entitled to an exemption from ad valorem property taxes under article XIII, &sect; 2 of the Utah Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The UTA had purchased 110 acres of property and had used 40 acres of the parcel for a bus terminal. The remaining acres had not been actively put to any use. The Board reasoned that, under &sect; 11-20-55 of the Code (Utah), the UTA was entitled to an exemption on only as much of its property that was actually &quot;used&quot; for transportation purposes. The 70 acres were not so used. The Commission then held that the UTA was a &quot;special district&quot; under the state constitution and that all of the property, including the 70 acres, was exempt without regard for the terms of &sect; 11-20-55 of the Code (Utah). On appeal, the court affirmed the grant of the exemption after rejecting the County's argument that &sect; 11-20-55 limited the availability of the article XIII, &sect; 2 exemption to property actively used for transportation purposes. The legislature could not narrow or otherwise alter a constitutional provision by legislation. Thus, the legislature could not change the constitutional exemption from one based on status of land ownership to one based on the use to which the land was put. The court concluded that the 70 acres were &quot;used solely for transportation purposes&quot; or were directly connected therewith.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of the exemption.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, individual teachers and other members of an education association, challenged a decision from the Third District, Salt Lake County (Utah), which entered judgment for defendant, the Utah State Retirement Board, and dismissed the teachers' complaint asserting an unconstitutional denial of equal protection under the 14th Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board received payments from employees based on a percentage of that employee's salary. A teacher's primary income was her regular salary. Secondary payments were made when a teacher rendered extra services. In 1983 and 1984, the Board adopted resolutions that excluded secondary contributions. However, members could request a refund of sums paid to the state retirement system for secondary income contributions. However, in 1985, the Board adopted a resolution terminating the right to those refunds. Some members received refunds under the 1983 and 1984 resolutions. On review, the court held that the trial court correctly ruled that the teachers failed to state a claim for relief based on a denial of equal protection. While there was a discrimination against certain teachers who were not able to obtain a refund of contributions on secondary income, whereas others in the same class had, that did not demonstrate a denial of equal protection of the laws. First, the teachers failed to prove that they could not have gotten a refund had they acted timely. Second, the teachers could make up the contributions on secondary income by way of increased retirement benefits.</SPAN></P>

The city challenged a judgment of the Fourth District, Juab County (Utah), which granted the motion of the State Engineer and defendant Utah State Division of Wildlife Resources for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city acquired four nonconsumptive water rights on a creek and used them to generate electricity. A flood destroyed the diversion and conveying works, and the city did not use the water rights for several years. It proposed to construct a new hydroelectric facility and filed applications with the State Engineer to permanently change the points of diversion specified for its water rights. The Division of Wildlife Resources protested the applications. The State Engineer rejected the applications on the ground that because the water rights had not been used for a period exceeding five years they had been forfeited under &sect; 73-1-4. The city appealed to the district court, which granted the State Engineer and Division of Wildlife Resources summary judgment. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 73-1-4 worked a forfeiture of the city's water rights, which were unused for about 30 years. Section 73-1-4 provided that when an appropriator abandoned or ceased to use water for five years the right ceased and the water reverted to the public. It was not inconsistent with Utah Const. art. XI, &sect; 6, which barred voluntary transfers, not involuntary transfers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted and convicted after shooting a police officer during a traffic stop. Defendant appealed and the court affirmed, even though some errors occurred at trial because the combined effect of those errors did not prejudice defendant's right to a fair trial. The court found that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, was sufficient for the jury to infer defendant's intent to commit murder. Defendant claimed that he shot the officer in self-defense, but because there was also evidence that defendant fired first, it was not unreasonable for the jury to infer that defendant intended to kill the officer. The defendant claimed to be intoxicated but failed to prove that his mind was affected so much that he could not form the requisite intent to kill. The court found that defendant was properly convicted of being a habitual criminal because that statute excluded only murder as a triggering offense, not attempted murder. The state was not required to establish that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily plead guilty to the other felony convictions that formed the basis of his being found a habitual criminal.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed because the tax scheme was constitutional and properly operated to impose a premium tax on insurers, except MBAs. As such, the statutes constituted general laws that did not offend the uniform operation of the laws requirement of Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 24.

The court found that the warning given was a fully effective equivalent of the Miranda warnings. The court ruled that defendant voluntarily waived his right to remain silent and his right to counsel before and during the interrogation. However, the court found that the detective's statements were impermissibly coercive because they carried a threat of greater punishment or a promise for lesser punishment depending on whether he confessed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim alleged that she was sexually abused by defendant but recanted during her trial testimony. A pediatrician testified that it was highly unlikely that the victim had been coached and believed she had been sexually abused. A social worker testified that the victim had been abused. A director of a sexual abuse treatment center testified that the victim's behavior was consistent with other sexually abused children. The trial court convicted defendant. The court reversed. There was no evidence before the trial court from which a determination of reliability could be made. The court concluded that the trial court erred when it permitted the experts to give their opinions on abuse. The court found that absent these evidentiary errors there was a reasonable likelihood of a result more favorable to defendant. The notice provided by the State did not meet the standard in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-411(3) for the director's testimony but the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with sexual abuse of a child and sodomy on a child. Pursuant to a plea bargain, defendant was mistakenly charged with a crime specified as sexual abuse of a child, but which alleged the elements of aggravated sexual abuse of a child.

Defendant filed a petition for a writ for habeas corpus alleging that he had been improperly sentenced. The trial court denied the petition, and defendant filed a second habeas petition, which the trial court denied on the merits. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the trial court properly ruled on the merits of defendant's petition instead of summarily dismissing it on procedural grounds because it raised a new issue concerning an allegedly unlawful sentence. The court agreed that defendant pleaded guilty to an offense for which he could not have been convicted. However, defendant's guilty plea was lawful because the offense pleaded to was not misleading as to defendant's criminal conduct and was given in exchange for a lesser sentence.</SPAN></P>

In vacating the death sentence, the court held that the trial court committed plain error by failing to follow the two-step formula, established by case law precedent, for determining whether the death penalty or a life sentence should be imposed. Although the trial court found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances, it failed to determine whether the death penalty was appropriate under all the circumstances of the case and in light of the circumstances of defendant's background and life as a whole.

The court reversed and remanded the trial court's decision. The act waived governmental immunity for most injuries caused by employee negligence committed within the scope of employment. Tort victims under the act were limited to a $ 100,000 recovery from a health care facility.

The court also held that the recovery limitation of the act violated the Utah Const. art.

On appeal he contended that: the trial court erroneously forced him to waive his right to a jury in the penalty phase; the trial court erred in admitting hypnotically enhanced testimony; and, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-202(1)(q), which classified an intentional killing committed in an especially heinous, atrocious, cruel, or exceptionally depraved manner as first degree murder, was unconstitutional. The court rejected defendant's first claim on standing grounds. Further, it determined that any error as to the admission of the hypnotically enhanced testimony was harmless. As to defendant's constitutional challenge to &sect; 76-5-202(1)(q), the court concluded that the statute was not facially unconstitutional, but that it did not apply to the facts of the case. The evidence did not support a finding that defendant had killed in the heinous quality proscribed under &sect; 76-5-202(1)(q). Thus, the trial court's judgment of conviction was reversed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sexually abused all three of his daughters prior to the onset of puberty. He was charged with aggravated sexual abuse of the eight-year-old daughter. Before the victim testified concerning the specific allegation of sexual abuse charged in the information, the older daughters testified that they had been sexually abused on numerous occasions by defendant. Neither of the older daughters testified as to any details of specific incidents; they testified only to general information regarding defendant's actions. The jury found defendant guilty, and the trial court sentenced him to a minimum mandatory term of imprisonment of six years. On appeal, the court affirmed and held, inter alia, that: (1) defendant properly preserved his objection to admission of the testimony of his older daughters; (2) the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of defendant's older daughters that he had sexually abused them before the jury decided whether defendant had committed the primary charge alleged; and (3) the admission of the testimony of defendant's daughters as to the aggravating acts did not affect the outcome in the case, as other evidence also supported defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

On further appeal, the court reversed and remanded.

Thus, the blood sample was taken contrary to the provisions of Utah Code Ann &sect; 41-6-44.10. Because the juvenile neither impliedly nor actually consented to the testing procedure, his blood test results were erroneously admitted at trial.

It found that the ordinance violated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment, and it reversed the conviction. A municipality's flat ban on the public solicitation of all private sexual activity was a content-based speech regulation that ran afoul of the First Amendment. The court could not find a legitimate construction of the ordinance's clear and explicit language that would bring it within constitutional limits. The ordinance plainly was one that involved substantial overbreadth and was invalid on its face.

In affirming the trial court's grant of summary judgment, the court held that Senate Bill 327 was constitutional under Utah. Const. art. VI, &sect; 28 because the legislature, under the state retirement system's laws, did not delegate any powers to anyone. Rather, the court found that the S.B. 327 simply regulated how municipalities were to perform the function of offering retirement benefits to its employees, if they chose to do it at all. The court held that Utah Const. art. XI, &sect; 5 did not apply to the population distinctions delineated in Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 49-11-23 and 49-6a-15.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-406.5 (Supp. 1988) violated the equal protection guarantees of both the United States and Utah Constitutions. He further contended that the minimum mandatory sentence provision found in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-403.1 (Supp. 1988) was unconstitutional because it was cruel and unusual punishment as it was applied to him. In affirming the sentence, the court found that a rational basis existed for the classification Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-406.5(1) (Supp. 1988) created. Therefore, that statute did not violate equal protection guarantees. Additionally, the standard for cruel and unusual punishment claims in specific application was whether the sentence imposed in proportion to the offense committed was such as to shock the moral sense of all reasonable men as to what was right and proper under the circumstances. The court did not believe that defendant's childhood abuse made the imposition of a ten-year minimum mandatory sentence cruel punishment as applied to him in contrast to other offenders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to withdraw his plea of guilty and mentally ill to the charge of sodomy on a child after he admitted sexually abusing his niece. When the trial court sentenced him to a minimum mandatory term of 15 years, with a recommendation that he be placed in an in-patient sex offender program, defendant appealed. The court vacated the sentence and remanded. The trial court found defendant mentally ill but did not hold a required sentencing hearing. Defendant had to be allowed to withdraw his plea if the state made a promise it did not or could not fulfill. The test was voluntariness. Defendant admitted acts sufficient to justify his conviction of the offense to which he pleaded guilty. The record suggested the possibility that defendant did not understand the value of the commitments made to him. The court struck Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-35-21.5(4)(c), (d) as unconstitutional. The legislature's intent was to provide for treatment of the mentally ill offender. The subsections were irrelevant to the treatment rationale. Their application was thus arbitrary and capricious in violation of the due process guarantee of Utah Const. art. I, &sect; VII.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the sodomy convictions but reversed the rape conviction, holding that there was insufficient evidence that defendant's penis was between the folds of the victim's labia during the alleged rape incident. Entry between the outer folds of the labia was sufficient to constitute penetration as that term was commonly used to define the crime of rape, and such was the definition of penetration under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-407(2) (Supp. 1985).

The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for a new trial. The court found that the trial court did not err in admitting other-crimes evidence because evidence of defendant's illicit conduct was probative of the proposition that defendant took the victim out of state with the requisite intent and without a good faith belief that he had implied permission from the victim's parents. However, the court held that defendant's requested instruction on not guilty by reason of insanity should have been given to assure that the jury properly considered the insanity defense. There was a substantial risk that the jury could have ignored the evidence of insanity if the jury misunderstood the consequences of a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity and focused instead on the fear that such a verdict would result in releasing a dangerous person to prey upon society.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that his probation term had already been terminated by operation of law pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-18-1(10)(a) (Supp. 1984) and that the trial court lacked authority to revoke probation after the expiration of the statutory period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to a charge of issuing bad checks under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-6-505 (1978). He was sentenced by the trial court to an indeterminate term of zero to five years in the Utah State Prison, fined, and ordered to pay restitution. The trial court suspended the prison term and the fine, and placed defendant on probation. As one condition of probation, defendant agreed that he would not violate federal, state, or local laws. Defendant was thereafter charged with committing sodomy on a child and attempted rape of a child within the eighteen-month statutory term of defendant's probation. Defendant was convicted of those offenses, and the trial court revoked his probation after it determined that he had not filed an appeal from those offenses. On review, the State argued that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-18-1(10)(a) (Supp. 1984) did not automatically terminate probation unless defendant committed no probation violations within the eighteen-month statutory term. Reversing, the court held in part that the strong mandate of &sect; 77-18-1(10)(a) that defendant &quot;should&quot; be terminated from sentence if probation was completed without violation was not consistent with the State's position.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the search warrant did not expressly authorize a search of defendant's home as a no-knock warrant, the police executed it believing it was a no-knock warrant. Defendant contended that it was error for the trial court not to suppress the evidence seized in the home. The court affirmed the conviction, concluding that Utah. Code Ann. 77-23-10 contemplated that absent no-knock authority or exigent circumstances, an officer should knock and announce his authority even if no one is on the premises. The court found that suppression of the evidence was not justified when an unauthorized no-knock entry was made when no one was home. Although the officers unannounced entry was not authorized by the warrant, it did not contribute appreciably to the invasion of privacy already authorized by the warrant. Furthermore, the officers made a proper announcement and gave proper notice when defendant arrived on the scene.

The mortgagor filed a declaration of homestead. The Third District Court of Salt Lake City (Utah) foreclosed on the mortgage and ordered the sale of the home. The district court also denied the mortgagor's motion for payment of her homestead exemption from amounts received by mortgagee from a foreclosure sale of her home. The mortgagor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgagor argued that to be constitutional under Utah Const. Art. XXII, Utah Code Ann. &sect;78-23-3(1) must be limited to purchase money liens. If the statute was so construed, then the mortgagee's nonpurchase money note and mortgage did not take priority over the mortgagor's homestead exemption, and she was entitled to receive the amount of her homestead exemption from the mortgagee. The court determined that the framers of the Utah Constitution did not intend the &quot;sale on execution&quot; language of Utah Const. Art. XXII, &sect; 1 to apply to the sale of homestead property pursuant to a mortgage foreclosure. Accordingly, the court determined that a mortgage foreclosure was not a &quot;sale on execution&quot; for the purposes of Art. XXII. The court also determined that Utah's statutory homestead exemption statute, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-23-3(1) was constitutionally valid. Therefore, all consensual security interest in land could have been enforced against the homestead property.</SPAN></P>

However, the court refused to consider defendant's the argument. The court acknowledged that the trial court found him ineligible, in part, for suspension of sentence under the statute because he had not been the victim's stepfather for at least a year. However, the court noted that the trial court found that defendant had failed two other requirements of the statute. Thus, defendant had not been denied based solely on his relationship. Nonetheless, the court held that the trial court erred in pronouncing sentence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, prisoner sought appeal from a decision of the Third District Court, Salt Lake County (Utah), which imposed a minimum mandatory prison term of ten years for four counts of aggravated sexual assault under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-405(1) (Supp. 1983).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court imposed a minimum mandatory prison term of 10 years for the four counts of aggravated sexual assault, ruling that the volume and violent nature of the crimes, and the indications of prior criminal conduct constituted aggravating circumstances, which were mitigated by expert testimony, defendant's sincere sorrow, and the psychological trauma that defendant suffered as a result of his military service in Vietnam. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of the minimum mandatory terms for the convictions, arguing that the sentences imposed were unconstitutionally disproportionate and that the minimum mandatory sentence unconstitutionally denied him medical treatment. Rejecting defendant's claim, the court reasoned that imposition of a severe penalty for a crime as serious as aggravated sexual assault was not constitutionally disproportionate, the court therefore affirmed the trial court's decision. The court rejected defendant's claim that the trial judge failed to specifically state the grounds for sentencing, since the trial judge mentioned the mitigating factors which was all he was required to do when his sentencing choice was the middle term sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state legislature passed an act that created a second method for formally investigating criminal activities in addition to the already authorized state grand jury. It provided the attorney general and county attorneys with the power to subpoena witnesses, grant transactional immunity, and conduct investigations in secret, all with limited judicial supervision. The district court held that the Subpoena Powers for Aid of Criminal Investigation and Grants of Immunity Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 77-22-1 to -3 (1982) was unconstitutional. The court held that the differences between the state grand jury system and the investigative system permitted under the Act were not enough, standing alone, to rise to the level of a violation of the uniform operation of laws requirement of the state constitution. The mere existence of a discretionary power in the state's attorney to select which mechanism to use did not offend the uniform operation of the law requirement. The court reversed the district court's ruling that the Subpoena Powers Act was facially unconstitutional, holding that the Act survived constitutional scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Public Service Commission of Utah (PSC) sought review of a declaratory judgment from the Third District Court (Utah), which awarded damages to plaintiff telecommunications companies upon the determination that one-way paging services were within PSC's jurisdiction. The telecommunications companies challenged a rule formulated by PSC as well as PSC's denial of an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As an initial matter, the court noted that common to each of the actions under review was the propriety of PSC's conclusion that it had no jurisdiction to regulate one-way paging communications services. The court then found that subject matter jurisdiction was nonexistent with respect to the request to review the dismissal of the application for a certificate, as the telecommunications companies failed to comply with Utah Code Ann. &sect; 54-7-15 (1986) by not applying for a rehearing with the PSC prior to seeking a writ to the court. The court similarly held that the failure to request rehearing left the court without subject matter jurisdiction over the petition to review the PSC's rule-making procedure. Nevertheless, the court then held that it did have subject matter jurisdiction over the civil action for damages and subsequently determined that the declaratory judgment in favor of the telecommunications companies had been improper. The court concluded that the PSC's decision construing its authority to exclude one-way paging services was rational and reasonably based and represented an appropriate, strict construction of the statutes authorizing jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the court determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to contemplate the denial of the application for a certificate as well as the petition for review of the PSC's rule, the court reversed the declaratory judgment in favor of the telecommunications company and remanded that matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After he was convicted for first degree murder, aggravated kidnapping, and sexual abuse of a child, Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 76-5-202 (1978 &amp; 1983), 76-5-302 (1978 &amp; 1987), 76-5-404.1 (1983), defendant was sentenced to death on all of the murder convictions and additional consecutive sentences for the other crimes. On appeal, defendant claimed that he was forced to exercise a peremptory challenge to remove a member who opposed the death penalty from the jury panel. Defendant also challenged the voir dire as a whole. The court found no abuse of discretion in the questioning of panel members, nor any violations of Utah R. Crim. P. 18. The court held that pretrial publicity and community sentiment did not inevitably lead to an unfair trial. Defendant failed to demonstrate actual prejudice by the trial court's refusal to grant defendant's motion for change of venue. The court held that Utah's death penalty scheme was constitutional and constitutionally applied to defendant. The court found that defendant's statements that were admitted as a confession were voluntarily made. Unwarned statements should have been excluded, but the error was harmless. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for first degree murder, aggravated kidnapping, and sexual abuse of a child. The trial court did not abuse its discretion during the voir dire, either in the individual questioning of jurors concerning the death penalty or questioning of the whole panel. Denial of the motion to change venue was not an abuse of discretion, and the death penalty was constitutionally applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the order from the trial court (Utah), which convicted him of aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, and aggravated assault.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was Hispanic, was tried in connection with the aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, and aggravated assault of a 68-year-old woman. Defendant sought to quash the jury panel on the ground that the selection procedure used did not ensure a fair cross-section, and the trial judge supplemented the panel with two venirepersons with Hispanic surnames. After one was removed by the prosecution on a peremptory challenge, defendant unsuccessfully objected, claiming that the challenge was predicated upon race. On appeal, the court was split as to whether defendant had met his burden of showing a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination and as to whether the facts and circumstances surrounding the challenge raised the inference of discriminatory intent, so it remanded the case for a determination of whether the peremptory challenge violated defendant's right to equal protection under Batson. The court held that the mere fact that the subject of the peremptory strike was a minority member did not alone raise the inference of discriminatory intent, and that it was not unconstitutional, without more, to strike one or more Hispanics from the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that defendant was competent to stand trial under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-15-2 (1982), because the relevant inquiry was whether defendant had the ability to assist counsel and not whether he in fact chose to assist counsel. The court also found that the trial court's rejection of the examiners' conclusions that defendant was incompetent was supported by their failure to explain the change in their opinions that occurred between the initial finding of competency and their subsequent finding of incompetency. The court held that in the absence of an adequate explanation, the trial court could properly reject as unpersuasive and unhelpful the conclusory labels the doctors assigned to defendant's condition. The court found that the State was permitted during the penalty phase to introduce evidence of aggravating factors in the form of other violent crimes that had not resulted in convictions. The court concluded that the commission of the violent acts was proven by undisputed eyewitness testimony that was sufficient to prove defendant's guilt of the unconvicted violent crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Intent could be inferred. Defendant had been named in a paternity action and could be liable for support. Defendant could not have thrown his live son into the river without knowledge or intent. Aggravating circumstances supported the conviction for the death of the mother. The jury could have found that both victims were killed at about the same time and as part of the same episode or scheme. The photographs were admissible because they were not particularly bloody or gruesome. Evidence gathered pursuant to a search was properly admitted based on consent. The court rejected defendant's argument that the &quot;death-qualified&quot; jury did not represent a cross-section of society.

On appeal, the court rejected defendant's contention that the prosecutor's closing argument mandated a reversal. The court found certain remarks were not prejudicial. The first remark was intended to bolster the girlfriend's credibility and was not intended to contrast her decision to testify with defendant's choice to remain silent. Other remarks were intended to assess defendant's courtroom demeanor. Although one comment exaggerated the facts, it concerned a point peripheral to the issue of defendant's guilt. Another statement was unwise and hyperbolic, but could not be construed as an attempt to inflame the jurors by appealing to their &quot;religious&quot; feelings. The trial court did not commit prejudicial error in excluding evidence of a polygraph test because, given the results and the examiner's opinion, there was no likelihood that the jury would have reached a different conclusion.

Based on her performance on the tests, she was arrested and later given a breathalyzer test that showed a blood alcohol content of .16 percent. Defendant challenged the admission of the breath test result on the ground that it did not have an adequate evidentiary foundation. Defendant asserted that her due process rights were violated by the short delay in the administration of the breathalyzer test. The lower court sustained the conviction. The court held that defendant's privilege against self-incrimination was not violated when she submitted to the breathalyzer test. The court noted that the 45 minutes prior to the test was clearly adequate to render the breathalyzer result reliable and that it could be inferred that the result accurately reflected the defendant's blood alcohol level at the time of the initial traffic stop.</SPAN></P>
