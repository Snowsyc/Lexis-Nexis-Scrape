</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant commissioner sought review of the order from the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which declared invalid an amendment to a regulation of the Department of Social Services regarding eligibility for Emergency Home Relief, permanently enjoined the commissioner from enforcing the invalidated amendment, and set aside prior administrative decisions for respondent applicants and provided requirements for change orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants brought an a combined declaratory judgment and N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding against the commissioner seeking a declaration that an amendment to the regulations governing the Emergency Home Relief (EHR) program, N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 18 &sect; 370.3(b)(2), which disqualified households with gross income in excess of 125 percent of the Federal poverty guidelines from eligibility for assistance, was invalid as arbitrary and capricious. The court held that the interpretation given by the agency to the regulation's income requirement, in the manner in which it determined an applicant's eligibility for emergency assistance in paying rent arrears, was fundamentally irrational, and that the within determinations, based on that interpretation, were properly set aside. The court held that eligibility was determined on the basis of gross income, which was reasonably computed to include the time during which the applicant should have been planning for the emergency and the period during which the emergency situation which resulted in the arrears endured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the commissioner's appeal and affirmed the portion of the Supreme Court's order that remanded the matter to the New York State Department of Social Services either to issue the Emergency Home Relief Grants or, if eligibility issues remained, to provide the applicants with an opportunity to establish eligibility.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social Services - Emergency Assistance - Validity of Income Test for Determining Eligibility for One-Time Allowance for Shelter Arrears An amendment to the regulations governing the &quot;Emergency Home Relief&quot; (EHR) program (18 NYCRR 370.3 [b] [2]), which disqualified households with a gross income in excess of 125% of the Federal poverty guidelines from eligibility for a one-time allowance for shelter arrears, is not invalid on its face in view of the legislative mandate to reduce spending on programs such as EHR and the subsequent enactment of legislation imposing the bright-line income test for EHR applications (Social Services Law &sect; 131-w).  However, the Department of Social Services' (DSS) interpretation of the amendment, by which it applies the income test for eligibility to prospective income only as of the time of the application for past rent, rather than to income prior to and during the emergency which led to the arrears, which is the only time during which &quot;planning&quot; could have taken place or the arrears could have been avoided, undermines and frustrates the underlying purpose of the regulation to prevent homelessness and the amendment's &quot;cost containment&quot; goal and is thus fundamentally irrational as applied to plaintiffs and plaintiffs-intervenors. While such a prospective method would be appropriate to determine eligibility for ongoing future social services or monthly payments of public assistance, there is no reasonable basis for using that method for determining eligibility for the type of emergency lump-sum assistance contemplated by the EHR program, which is designed to redress past emergencies which are already over, in distinction to ongoing financial need.  Accordingly, the administrative determinations based on DSS's interpretation were properly set aside.  On remand, DSS must determine eligibility on the basis of gross income which is reasonably computed to include the time during which the applicant should have been planning for the emergency and the period during which the emergency situation which resulted in the arrears endured.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, state medical society and others, appealed from an order and judgment of the Supreme Court in Albany County (New York), which granted a motion by plaintiffs for summary judgment, declared 1990 N.Y. Laws 190, &sect; 280 to be unconstitutional, and denied summary judgment to defendants, Commissioner of the Department of Education and others.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question presented on appeal was whether 1990 N.Y. Laws 190, &sect;&sect; 278, 280, which reduced the period of physicians' registration under N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 6524(8), N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 8, &sect; 59.8, by one year and concomitantly increased the registration fee from $ 240 to $ 330 violated the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution, took physicians' property without compensation, and denied physicians their right to due process. The court held in the negative. Absent some clear indication that the legislature intended to bind the state contractually, a statute was presumed not to create private contractual or vested rights, but merely declared a policy to be pursued until the legislature ordained otherwise. The legislature, in passing N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 6524(8), as amended, never intended to create private rights of a contractual nature enforceable against the state. While a valid registration was necessary to use a medical license, it was ministerial and financial in nature. There was no property right in the duration of the registration. To the extent 1990 N.Y. Laws 190, &sect; 280, affected the underlying medical licenses, it effected no taking.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order and judgment, denied plaintiffs' motion, granted the Commissioner's motion for summary judgment, and declared that the law at issue had not been shown to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Contract Clause - Change in Physicians' Registration Period Laws of 1990 (ch 190, &sect; 280), which reduced the period of physicians' registration ( Education Law &sect; 6524 [8]; 8 NYCRR 59.8) by one year and concomitantly increased the registration fee from $ 240 to $ 330, does not violate the Contract Clause of the US Constitution.  Absent some clear indication that the Legislature intends to bind the State contractually, a statute is presumed not to create private contractual or vested rights. Before a law may be deemed to be a contract between the State and a third party, examination of the statutory language must show it to be plain and susceptible of no other reasonable construction than that a contract was intended.  Here, the challenged fee structure is merely one measure of governing the conduct of this heavily regulated business. The statutes in question are clearly general in scope based upon public policy considerations and cannot be interpreted to manifest a legislative intent to create private rights of a contractual nature enforceable against the State.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Taking of Property - No Property Right in Physician's Registration With respect to a claim of an unconstitutional taking, there is no property right in the term of a physician's registration. A medical license is a valuable property right, but a valid registration, while necessary to use a medical license, is ministerial and financial in nature.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Taking of Property - Change in Physicians' Registration Period - Effect on Medical Licenses Laws of 1990 (ch 190, &sect; 280), which reduced the period of physicians' registration ( Education Law &sect; 6524 [8]; 8 NYCRR 59.8) by one year and concomitantly increased the registration fee from $ 240 to $ 330, effects no unconstitutional taking (US Const 5th Amend) to the extent that it affects the underlying medical licenses. The limited economic impact, together with the de minimis effort involved in the reregistration process, has, at best, only a remote effect upon, or interference with, the ability of doctors to fully utilize their medical licenses. Further, the revenue gained is used in policing the quality of medical care within the State, the heavily regulated business interest from which the revenue is raised.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Due Process of Law - Sufficiency of Notice of Change in Physicians' Registration Period With respect to Laws of 1990 (ch 190, &sect; 280), which reduced the period of physicians' registration ( Education Law &sect; 6524 [8]; 8 NYCRR 59.8) by one year and concomitantly increased the registration fee from $ 240 to $ 330, no procedural or substantive due process violations occurred from the lack of individualized notice of the charge to each physician, and notice of the right to hearings regarding the changes in the registration fee and time periods.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state court administrator filed an action against respondent state comptroller challenging the state comptroller's act of charging judicially required restitution payments to court employees in the 1991-1992 fiscal year judiciary appropriation. The Supreme Court, Albany County (New York) concluded that the state comptroller properly charged the restitution against the 1991-1992 appropriation. The state court administrator appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In implementing a piece of legislation, the state comptroller withheld a portion of wages from certain court employees. The lagged payroll was declared unconstitutional and restitution was awarded to the affected employees. The federal district court that ordered restitution also directed that restitution be paid from the fiscal year 1990-1991 appropriation. In October 1991, restitution plus interest was paid to the employees, and the state comptroller unilaterally charged the sum paid to the judiciary's 1991-1992 appropriation. After the state court administrator filed an action challenging the state comptroller's allocation of the funds to the 1991-1992 fiscal year, the trial court entered a provisional order designed to prevent the lapse of unexpended funds allocated to the judiciary for the 1991-1992 fiscal year. The trial court properly rejected the state court administrator's argument that the restitution could have been charged against the judiciary's 1992-1993 appropriation; charging the restitution to the 1991-1992 judiciary appropriation reflected the correct charge that was required at the time of payment. The state comptroller's action was constitutional and was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order holding that the state comptroller properly charged the required restitution against the 1991-1992 judiciary appropriation was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts - Unified Court System - Unilateral Transfer of Unexpended Fund Balances within Judiciary Appropriation by State Comptroller - Lagged Payroll Restitution The State Comptroller acted properly and within his constitutional power to audit all claims against the State and &quot;all official accounts&quot; (NY Const, art V, &sect; 1) when he unilaterally charged certain lagged payroll restitution payments to the judiciary's fiscal year 1991-1992 appropriation, where a Federal court action ordered such restitution to be made to judiciary employees; that liability concededly arose in fiscal year 1991-1992, and was paid in that same fiscal year by the Comptroller in compliance with the order of the Federal court.  The only task remaining was the performance of the Comptroller's paradigmatic function of accounting for that payment, and at the time the required restitution was actually made, in October 1991, the only valid charge was against the judiciary's appropriation for fiscal year 1991-1992; the appropriation for fiscal year 1990-1991, which gave rise to the lagged payroll scheme, could not be used as that fiscal year closed on March 31, 1991, and even if the liability to lagged court employees had been incurred in fiscal year 1990-1991, the following year's appropriation lapsed as a matter of law on September 15, 1991, before the restitution payments were made </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;State Finance Law &sect; 40 [3]).  It was only because of a District Court order, later reversed, that the Comptroller was prevented, at the time restitution was made, from transferring to the general State treasury the lapsed money of the fiscal year 1990-1991 judiciary budget in a special account which had been created as a result of the Federal litigation.  Moreover, when the restitution payments were actually made, they could not have been charged against any fiscal year 1992-1993 appropriation because that appropriation had not yet been enacted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art VII, &sect; 7).  </SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 210, &sect;&sect; 1-7, which changed the method of employer contributions to retirement funds, unconstitutional. The unions and others had collectively filed actions against the State and the comptroller for a declaration that chapter 210 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The comptroller, who was the administrative head of certain public employees' retirement system, used the aggregate cost, which varied moderately over time, method for calculating employer contributions to the fund. Then, the Legislature passed 1990 N.Y. Laws ch. 210, requiring the comptroller to use the projected unit credit method, which resulted in necessary contributions becoming more volatile, to calculate employer contributions. The new method resulted in a drastic reduction in employer contributions and depleted the surplus, requiring higher employer contributions. The unions and others then collectively filed three actions to declare the statute unconstitutional. On appeal from a summary judgment for the employers, the court held that: (1) the statute was unconstitutional because it imposed a particular funding method, as opposed to the mere setting of guidelines for selection of a method, and vitiated its members' right to have the benefit of the comptroller's discretion in fixing the amount of contributions needed for the continued stability and security of the systems; and (2) the legislature could not compel the comptroller to carry out dramatic funding changes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Laws of 1990 (ch 210, &sect; 1-7), which require the State Comptroller to use particular methods of valuing the funds from which benefits of membership in the public retirement systems are derived and of calculating employer contributions for a given year, are unconstitutional as impermissibly impairing the contractual rights of the retirement systems' members (NY Const, art V, &sect; 7).  The imposition of a particular funding method, as opposed to the mere setting of guidelines for selection of a method, vitiates the members' right to have the benefit of the Comptroller's discretion in fixing the amount of contributions needed for the continued stability and security of the retirement systems.  Notwithstanding that the funding method imposed may be &quot;actuarially sound&quot;, it may work an impairment of the members' right to protection of the sources of funds from which benefits will ultimately be drawn, since the method imposed is less safe than the very safe method heretofore employed by the Comptroller.  Moreover, chapter 210 does not simply impose a funding method on the Comptroller; it also dictates the rapid depletion of the surplus funds that currently exist, a further usurpation of the Comptroller's authority to manage the accounts of the fund.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Laws of 1990 (ch 210) is unconstitutional to the extent it requires the State Comptroller to revalue the assets of the public retirement systems fund for fiscal years 1988 and 1989 using a different &quot;smoothing method&quot; than that chosen for those years upon the advice of his selected actuary, and that he provide the Director of the Division of the Budget with advance notice of any changes made to the method of actuarial valuation, since these requirements strip the systems' members of their right to the Comptroller's independent judgment. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In order to create new city council districts, the commission was formed. Pursuant to N.Y. City Charter &sect; 52 (charter), the commission was given several criteria for creating districts. The residents and civic organizations challenged the district lines drawn by the commission and claimed that certain areas were part of their neighborhood and that the commission had violated the charter by failing to keep their neighborhood intact. The trial court found that the commission's decision not to include certain areas when it redrew the district lines for the neighborhood at issue was arbitrary and capricious. The trial court ordered that the district lines be redrawn. The commission appealed. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's decision. In reaching its conclusion, the court found that, under the facts of the case, the decision not to split the census tabulation block served no real purpose and did not implicate the concerns underlying the general policy of not splitting census blocks. The court further found that the commission's placement of two piers in a district other than the residents' district also was arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections - Redistricting Plan - New York City Districting Commission - Mandate to Keep Neighborhoods Intact The New York City Districting Commission violated the requirements of the New York City Charter in promulgating a redistricting plan which, in order to establish a district with a majority of Latinos, created a land bridge between two communities by annexing all of a census tabulation block to the new district, rather than splitting the census tabulation block so as not to annex that portion of the block that has historically been considered part of a nearby neighborhood. Under New York City Charter &sect; 52 (1), the Commission in creating new districts was required to apply several criteria to the maximum extent possible and give preference according to the order in which those criteria were listed.  Since splitting the block would not have hampered the Commission's desire to create a Latino district, or violated any of the other districting criteria, the Commission, by neglecting to apply the third criterion of keeping neighborhoods intact, failed to implement City Charter &sect; 52 (1) (c) to the maximum extent possible.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections - Redistricting Plan - New York City Districting Commission - Burden of Proof on Challenge to Plan In a proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 challenging a determination of the New York City Districting Commission promulgating a redistricting plan with respect to certain districts as violative of New York City Charter &sect; 52 (1) (c), which mandates that district lines shall keep intact neighborhoods and communities with established ties of common interest and association, petitioners were not required to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the relevant portion of a census tabulation block annexed in its entirety to the new district was part of petitioners' neighborhood, since petitioners claim only that the incidental determination of the Commission in refusing to split the block was unnecessary to the creation or maintenance of any other district and violated the interest recognized in the City Charter of keeping neighborhoods intact. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections - Redistricting Plan - New York City Districting Commission - Splitting Census Tabulation Block New York City Charter &sect; 1152 (d) (11) (b), which provides that the New York City Districting Commission &quot;shall utilize the final count results of the [1990] census&quot; did not prohibit the Commission from splitting a census tabulation block in creating a new City Council district so as to keep intact a nearby neighborhood that historically contained a portion of that block. Any interpretation by the Commission of section 1152 must be secondary to interpretation of the criteria contained in New York City Charter &sect; 52, which includes the mandate to keep intact neighborhoods and communities with established ties of common interest and association.  Moreover, minor deviations of population equality that result from splitting a census tabulation block are permissible if necessary to allow government to pursue other legitimate objectives.  Here, splitting the block would result in a deviation from one district to another of no more than 47 persons, and the City Charter mandate of preserving neighborhood integrity is a legitimate objective.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections - Redistricting Plan - New York City Districting Commission - Preservation of County Boundaries A determination of the New York City Districting Commission which placed certain piers in a Manhattan City Council district, rather than keeping the piers in the Brooklyn City Council district containing the neighborhood of which the piers were a part, solely to follow county boundaries, is arbitrary and capricious. In giving more weight to the preservation of county boundaries than to keeping the subject Brooklyn neighborhood intact, the Commission failed to give the City Charter criteria for promulgating a redistricting plan the proper priority </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY City Charter &sect; 52 [1]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections - Redistricting Plan - New York City Districting Commission - Effect of Voting Rights Act of 1965 Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 USC &sect; 1973c) does not require preclearance of the court-ordered changes in the New York City Council district lines.  State courts have the power to decide, as a collateral matter, whether section 5 applies to contemplated changes in election procedures.  Moreover, in this case involving a challenge to the portion of a redistricting plan promulgated by the New York City Districting Commission which annexed all of a certain census tabulation block to a newly created district, no voting rights would be affected in any event since the disputed area is virtually unpopulated.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The building owner had purchased the building intending to demolish it in favor of erecting a business tower. The city had denied the demolition permit alleging a possible application of Administrative Code of City of N.Y. &sect; 27-198(a), and then granted the permit after extracting from the seller of the building and the building owner each payment to the city benefitting the homeless. The building owner executed a promissory note. However, it had never been informed that his permit application had already long been approved. The city then sought payment on the note and the trial court granted it summary judgment. On appeal, the court held that the building owner should have been granted summary judgment and that the city's complaint should have been dismissed as against public policy. The court reasoned that the city's asserted goal, providing housing for low-and moderate-income people, while laudable, could not be achieved by extortion. Because the actions of the city violated public policy, they thereby rendered the agreements void and unenforceable. Citizens had the right to expect that all applicants were treated equally and fairly. The city violated the public trust.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contracts - Illegal Contracts - Public Policy - Agreement to Expedite City's Grant of Demolition Permit An agreement executed in 1985 whereby defendant, a real estate developer, in connection with its plan to construct an office tower on the site of an existing building, agreed to pay $ 500,000 to a charitable trust for low-and moderate-income housing, in addition to the $ 1,000,000 the building owner agreed to contribute to the trust from the proceeds of the sale, if it received a prompt determination from plaintiff City of New York that the existing building was exempt from the moratorium on the demolition of single-room occupancy (SRO) buildings then in effect and was timely issued the necessary permits to begin lawful construction, is void and unenforceable as violative of public policy. The City's action in extracting payments from defendants in exchange for a favorable determination of the building's status, after the Department of Buildings had already determined that the building was not an SRO and had approved the demolition permit application, was fraudulent.  The City's otherwise laudable goal of providing housing for low-and moderate-income people could not properly be achieved by extortion, with the City playing the role of adversary rather than administrative authority.  The City had a duty to render its determination as to the building's status expeditiously and based solely on a review of the relevant criteria.  By accepting money to accelerate its review process and promising a favorable determination, the City abused its governmental power and betrayed the public trust.  Citizens have the right to expect that all applicants will be treated equally and fairly and that the safeguards imposed by regulations will be followed.  Accordingly, the complaint should be dismissed and defendants granted leave to file an amended counterclaim. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The phone company sought a refund of taxes based upon its recalculation of its tax liability applying the deduction for carrier access expense to its apportioned state revenues. The phone company argued that the requirement that the deduction be taken from total unapportioned interstate and international receipts violated the Commerce Clause. The court reversed, and held that because the effect of &sect; 186-a(2-a) was to discriminate against long distance carriers to the extent that they did business outside the state, the statute violated the Commerce Clause. The effect of the law was to give the benefit of a tax deduction to otherwise identically situated long distance carriers in different amounts based solely on, and in direct proportion to, the percentage of their property within the state. The method of allowing a tax deduction for New York access fees violated the Commerce Clause because the amount of the deduction increased or decreased based solely upon the percentage of the long distance carrier's property within or without the state.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Tax Law &sect; 186-a (2-a) which, with respect to the flat tax imposed on the adjusted gross receipts of long distance telephone carriers, has the effect of giving a tax deduction to otherwise identically situated long distance carriers in different amounts based solely on, and in direct proportion to, the percentage of their property within the State, discriminates against interstate and foreign commerce and is, therefore, unconstitutional as violative of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution (art I, &sect; 8, cl [3]).  A State may tax long distance telephone carriers in such a way that a carrier doing most of its business within the State has a lower effective tax rate than a carrier doing most of its business outside the State.

The conviction arose from petitioner's display of a poster featuring a grossly overweight naked woman and four postcards that depicted a male and several females in various stages of undress. The local law was a statute aimed at the display of obscene material. The court held that the law was invalid and annulled on the grounds of preemption, because N.Y. Penal Law and N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner has been a prison inmate for 22 years, following his conviction of murder, manslaughter, attempted robbery, assault, and possession of a dangerous weapon. He was never indicted for intentional murder but was convicted under the felony murder statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.25. After the Parole Board again denied petitioner parole, he brought a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 seeking to set aside the decision of the Board. The supreme court granted the petition on the ground that the decision to deny parole was irrational. On the Board's appeal, the court found that the decision made by the Board was based on a fundamental misunderstanding of its role and its power, and was not in accord with statutory requirements. The record clearly revealed that the denial of petitioner's application was a foregone conclusion, and since neither the death penalty nor life imprisonment without the possibility of parole was a part of the state law, neither should have entered into the Board's consideration. The court found that the decision of the Board had been fatally tainted by its abdication of its responsibility to fairly consider all relevant factors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that portion of the trial court's order requiring the Board to release petitioner to parole supervision and remanded the matter to the Board with directions to provide petitioner with a de novo hearing before a different panel, which was to consider all of the statutory criteria and all available information relevant to whether petitioner should be granted parole.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parole - Denial - Improper Denial Based Solely on Factor That Victim in Felony Murder was Police Officer - Required Consideration of All Relevant Statutory Criteria for Parole Release </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Parole Board acted improperly in denying parole release to petitioner, a prison inmate for 22 years following his felony murder conviction for his involvement in the shooting death of an off-duty, plain-clothes police officer during the robbery of a fast food restaurant in 1970, since the decision of the Board was based on a fundamental misunderstanding of its role and its power, and was not in accord with statutory requirements (Executive Law &sect; 259-i [1] [a]; [2] [c]), including petitioner's educational and other achievements which clearly demonstrate his extraordinary rehabilitative achievements and appear to strongly militate in favor of granting parole. The record reveals that the Board was proceeding on the mistaken assumption that its primary duty was to determine, in the abstract, the appropriate penalty for murder in today's society.  The role of the Parole Board is not to resentence petitioner according to the personal opinions of its members as to the appropriate penalty for murder, but to determine whether, as of this moment, given all the relevant statutory factors, he should be released.  For the Board to simply decide that any case which involves the death of a police officer, regardless of all of the other circumstances surrounding the crime, automatically necessitates the denial of parole because of the &quot;seriousness of the crime&quot; is a breach of the obligation legislatively imposed upon it to render a qualitative judgment based upon a review of all the relevant factors.  Accordingly, respondent is directed to provide petitioner with a de novo hearing before a different panel.  </SPAN></P>

The &quot;notice of defect&quot; law of the Town of Hempstead, which requires the service of a prior written notice of defect, in addition to the service of a written notice of claim, as a precondition to municipal tort liability based upon defective conditions alleged to exist upon certain Town properties, including beach and playground areas, is not invalid solely because it is inconsistent with General Municipal Law &sect; 50-e (4), which is applicable to towns by virtue of Town Law &sect; 67 and provides that those municipal corporations which, under law, require notices of claim as a precondition to liability may not also require notices of defect, except as to defects to highways, streets, bridges, culverts, sidewalks or crosswalks, since the Town may supersede State law on matters of local concern, such as the presentation of claims against the Town (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2 [c] [ii] [5]; Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 10 [1] [ii] [a] [5]) and the care and management of Town property (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2 [c] [ii] [6]; Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 10 [1] [ii] [a] [6]) in the absence of any clear expression of legislative intent prohibiting towns from expanding the class of municipal properties with respect to which notices of defect may be required beyond those specific types of properties mentioned in General Municipal Law &sect; 50-e (4) (Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 10 [1] [ii] [d] [3]).  However, a town that seeks to invoke its supersession authority must substantially comply with Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 22 (1), which requires a municipality to state its intention to supersede State law with definiteness and explicitness.  Since the local law under review does not identify in any way the provision of General Municipal Law &sect; 50-e (4) which it is intended to supersede, it was not enacted in accordance with the Town's supersession powers and is thus invalid to the extent that it requires the service of a prior written notice of defect as a precondition to tort liability based upon defective conditions alleged to exist upon properties which do not constitute highways, streets, bridges, culverts, sidewalks or crosswalks. Accordingly, the complaint premised upon injuries sustained because of an allegedly dangerous paddleball court at a Town beach club is reinstated.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal - Matters Appealable - Appeal from Intermediate Order When Judgment Has Been Entered </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action to recover damages for personal injuries sustained as the result of an allegedly dangerous Town paddleball court, the appeal from the intermediate order dismissing the complaint due to plaintiff's failure to comply with the Town's &quot;notice of defect&quot; law must be dismissed because the right of direct appeal therefrom terminated with the entry of judgment in the action.  The issues raised on appeal from the order are brought up for review and have been considered on the appeal from the judgment (CPLR 5501 [a] [1]).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and imposed a sentence that was less than the statutory minimum. Defendant contended on appeal that that the evidence failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that she was the woman who sold an undercover officer vials containing cocaine. The state brought a cross-appeal of the sentence imposed. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found that there was ample evidence that the officer had sufficient opportunity to observe defendant closely enough to permit a reliable identification at the trial and that the jury was entitled to credit this identification. The court also found that the testimony of the state's chemist demonstrated that defendant sold two ounces or more of cocaine. The court concluded that imposition of the statutory minimum sentence against defendant under the circumstances would have been cruel and inhuman punishment under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 5 and the Eighth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sentence - Cruel and Unusual Punishment - Mandatory 15-Year Minimum Sentence </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was lawfully convicted of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree for selling 214 vials containing cocaine to an undercover officer in view of the ample evidence that the officer had sufficient opportunity during the sale to observe defendant closely enough to permit a reliable identification at the trial and in view of the testimony of the chemist who testified for the People as to the procedure he employed in weighing the contents of the vials. In addition, the trial court did not illegally impose a reduced sentence of only 8 years to life instead of the statutorily mandated minimum of 15 years to life (Penal Law &sect; 70.00 [2] [a]; [3] [a] [i]; &sect; 220.43) based upon its finding that the punitive statutory minimum sentence, when viewed against such factors as defendant's age, her lack of a criminal history and the pretrial offer of 3 years to life, would constitute cruel and unusual punishment (NY Const, art I, &sect; 5; US Const 8th Amend) as applied to defendant.  This is the type of &quot;rare case&quot; in which it may be found that the otherwise constitutional statutory sentencing scheme would be unconstitutional as applied.  A system of justice which mandates a 15-year prison sentence, as a minimum, on a 17-year-old girl, who was not cared for by parents and was under the domination of her uncle, the prime mover in the sale of narcotics, also mandates a lifetime of crime and imposes on the community, upon her release, a woman who may be incapable of anything but criminal activity.  Accordingly, the judgment should be affirmed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner water company appealed from a decision by respondent Saratoga County Water Authority (water authority), which condemned the water company's assets and real property under N.Y. Em. Dom. Proc. Law &sect; 207 for the creation of a coordinated public water system. The water company argued that N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 1199-eee(5), which the water authority relied upon, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The water authority concluded that the acquisition of the water company's assets and property was required for the maintenance and operation of a town water system and the creation of a coordinated public water system. The water company filed a lawsuit, contending that under &sect; 1199-eee(5), the method that established just compensation was deprivation without due process; the determination of just compensation was impermissibly vested in the legislature; and that it was unconstitutionally vague. The water company argued that the water authority lacked authority to condemn property that was not regulated by the Public Service Commission and that the record did not support its argument that the acquisitions were for a public benefit, use or purpose. The court affirmed the determinations and dismissed the water company's petition. The court concluded that (1) the condemnation fulfilled a sufficient public use and purpose of providing an adequate water supply to the county; (2) there was no excessive taking because the property was needed to build the best route to water mains; and (3) the water company was not denied due process to comment upon and challenge the proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court confirmed the determinations by the water authority that it needed to acquire the water company's assets and property for the county's water system, and the water company's petition was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Public Authorities Law &sect; 1199-eee (5), which authorizes respondent Water Authority to acquire, by various means, any real or personal property necessary to fulfill its purpose of ensuring an adequate water supply for the future of Saratoga County, does not unconstitutionally deprive petitioners of their property without due process of law by restricting the methods for determining just compensation to the net income capitalization methodology &quot;based on the actual net income as allowed&quot; by the Public Service Commission, nor does the statute impermissibly remove the determination of just compensation from the judiciary and vest it in the Legislature.  The statute can rationally be interpreted so as not to abrogate petitioners' rights to receive from Supreme Court a determination of just compensation providing them with the fair market value of the condemned property in its highest and best use on the date of the taking.  The statute merely implies a preference for the income capitalization method but does not dictate that such method of computation be used in determining just compensation.  Under the statutory scheme the Supreme Court may use any other method of computation in determining the fair market value of the property.  Under these circumstances, respondent has to either accept that amount or discontinue the condemnation proceeding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eminent Domain - Award - Water Authority - Vagueness of Authorizing Statute&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Public Authorities Law &sect; 1199-eee (5), which authorizes respondent Water Authority to acquire, by various means, any real or personal property necessary to fulfill its purpose of ensuring an adequate water supply for the future of Saratoga County, is not unconstitutionally vague for allegedly failing to establish when a taking occurs so that the valuation of the property can be decided.  Rather, the statute sufficiently defines when the property vests in respondent and therefore is not open to arbitrary or capricious enforcement.  The statute indicates that if Supreme Court values the property according to the income capitalization method, title to the property vests in respondent once the determination of just compensation has been made, a final judgment is entered, the final decree is filed and the appeal process ends either by expiration of the time for appeal or the completion of an appeal.  In providing for an alternative computation methodology, the Legislature declined to provide for a different time for vesting. It can therefore be concluded that a similar time for vesting would be allowed when alternative methods are used, allowing for respondent to withdraw the condemnation proceeding within that time frame.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eminent Domain - Public Use - Water Authority - Excessive Taking </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Public Authorities Law &sect; 1199-eee (5), which authorizes respondent Water Authority to acquire, by various means, any real or personal property necessary to fulfill its purpose of ensuring an adequate water supply for the future of Saratoga County, does not limit respondent to only condemning property which is regulated by the Public Service Commission. The statutory provision which states that title to condemned property shall vest in respondent when Supreme Court decides that the compensation for the real property shall be determined based on &quot;the income capitalization method of valuation based on the actual net income as allowed by the&quot; Public Service Commission, only relates to when title vests in respondent.  The fact that the statute also provides for alternative methodologies to value property is a recognition that not all properties to be acquired would fall under the auspices of the Public Service Commission. Respondent's condemnation of petitioners' assets and real property in this case for the creation of a coordinated public water system must be upheld since the record establishes that the condemnation serves a sufficient public use and purpose.  Furthermore, the record does does not support petitioners' contention that there was an excessive taking because of an allegedly alternative and superior route for the acquisition involving the annexation of less of petitioners' property.  There was no excessive taking given the fact that respondents' route goes more directly to the water mains, the public purpose to be served by the condemnation and the fact that respondent's proposed route was found not to pose any significant environmental concerns.  Lastly, the notice sent by respondent to petitioners sufficiently identified the parcels of property to be affected by the condemnation proceeding to satisfy due process (EDPL 202 [A]) and petitioners were not deprived of a meaningful opportunity to comment upon and challenge the condemnation proceeding. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from an order of the Supreme Court, Bronx County (New York), which granted defendant's motion to suppress physical evidence in the charge against defendant of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree. The State contended that suppression was erroneous, in that the police action in pursuing defendant was justified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, and defendant's motion to suppress the physical evidence, including a gun, was granted by the trial court. The State appealed, contending that the police pursuit of defendant was justified. The court affirmed the suppression, holding that the police had acted on an anonymously reported incident and had pursued defendant only because he had refused to respond to police inquiry. As such, the court found no predicate for the pursuit of defendant. The court held that the police had no indication that defendant had committed or was about to commit any illegal act, apart from the fact that defendant fled upon being approached by the police for information. The court held that the absolute minimum predicate required to support the seizure of a civilian was a reasonable suspicion that the person to be seized had committed or was about to commit a crime. The court found nothing that would have justified such a reasonable suspicion and accordingly held that suppression was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the suppression of physical evidence in an action charging defendant with criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree. The court held that the police did not have any reasonable suspicion that defendant had committed or was about to commit a crime that would have justified seizing him. The court noted that defendant's refusal to respond to police inquiry and his flight, without more, did not justify their pursuit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Unlawful Search and Seizure - Gun Discarded during Flight from Illegal Police Pursuit </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A gun discarded by defendant as he fled when police officers approached him to make inquiry must be suppressed since the police, having returned to the location specified in an anonymous radio run as the place where a man with a knife was taking part in a fight with a large group of people after initially observing no fight and no one with a knife on the scene, had absolutely no reason to believe that defendant or any of the other men with whom he was standing had been involved in any criminal activity and thus had no basis to approach and then pursue defendant.  Under the circumstances, the officers' decision to pursue defendant can have been based upon nothing more than the fact that he chose to avoid them.  Defendant, however, had a right to refuse to respond to police inquiry and his flight when the officers approached could not, in and of itself, create a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Only founded suspicion of a person's involvement in criminal activity will justify police pursuit. A police officer's mere curiosity, even if legitimately piqued, cannot suffice as a basis for seizure and interrogation.  It is only if a refusal to respond to legitimate police inquiry in combination with other relevant circumstances gives rise to a reasonable suspicion that a person has committed or is about to commit a crime that a person can be kept from going about his or her business.  Accordingly, the order granting defendant's suppression motion based upon the finding that defendant's discard of the gun had been a spontaneous reaction to the illegal police conduct should be affirmed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant town sought review of the judgment entered by the Supreme Court of Suffolk County (New York) in favor of plaintiff property owner, a decision that declared the notice provisions of Brookhaven Town Code &sect; 85-23 unconstitutional and invalidated the rezoning of certain real property owned by the property owner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner filed an action against the town for its rezoning of the property he owned from business to residential. The property owner argued that the rezoning should be set aside on the ground that he had been unconstitutionally deprived of actual notice and an opportunity to attend the public hearing. The trial court held that the notice provisions of Brookhaven Town Code were are unconstitutional because they did not ensure that actual notice of a proposed rezoning would be provided to the true current property owner in every case. The court found that it was to determine whether the notice of the public hearing concerning the rezoning, notice that was given pursuant to the provisions of the Brookhaven Town Code both by publication and by mail to the address of the last property owner as was reflected in the town's most recent tax assessment roll, was constitutionally sufficient. The court held that it was sufficient. The use of the town's assessment roll in providing notice by mail comported with the requirements of due process. The assessment roll constituted a comprehensive and generally accurate compilation of property ownership.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's judgment and declared that the notice given in the case pursuant to the notice provisions of the Brookhaven Town Code met constitutional requirements.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Zoning - Notice of Proposed Rezoning - Constitutionality of Use of Assessment Roll in Providing Notice by Mail to Property Owners </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defendant Town's method of giving notice of a public hearing concerning the planned rezoning of several parcels, including plaintiff's premises, from a business to a residential zone, both by publication and by mail to the address of the last property owner as reflected in the Town's most recent tax assessment roll as provided by the Town Code, met constitutional due process requirements in this case even though plaintiff, who planned to erect a dental office on his property, did not receive actual notice because the assessment roll still reflected the name and address of the previous owner 11 weeks after plaintiff had recorded his deed.  The use of the assessment roll in providing notice by mail to property owners comports with the requirements of due process and the Town's use of its current assessment roll was appropriate under the circumstances.  Plaintiff's allegation that the information on the roll was not properly updated in this case is without support in the record.  Plaintiff did not provide notice to either the Town Board or the Town Clerk that title to the subject premises had changed hands.  Furthermore, plaintiff's assertion that he paid property taxes on the parcel and thereby gave the appropriate Town authorities notice of his ownership is not supported by any documentary evidence.  In addition, plaintiff has not produced any evidence of a requirement that the assessment roll be periodically updated at specific intervals during the tax year to reflect changes in ownership. Moreover, a balancing of the Town's interests against those of the property owners militates against imposing a duty on the Town to verify property ownership information with the County Clerk's office before sending out notices of proposed rezoning to property owners.  Such an obligation to create a time-consuming and costly verification system far exceeds the duty to employ a method of notice which is reasonably calculated to apprise owners of a proposed action, and is not constitutionally required.  Finally, there is no reason to conclude that more stringent notice procedures should be required for the rezoning of the property in this case than would ordinarily be necessary in an action to foreclose on property for nonpayment of taxes.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, who were local tenants and residents of nearby buildings, brought an original proceeding pursuant to N.Y. Em. Dom. Proc. Law &sect; 207 which provides for review of the determination and findings of a condemnor. They sought review of a proposed housing project in their neighborhood. Petitioners contended that respondent state urban development corporation was merely lending its name and extraordinary powers to other parties who realistically had a primary stake and interest in the project greater than respondent's interest, and that this was outside the scope of respondent's authority. The court found that the express language of the statute, creating the respondent agency, did not bar respondent's participation in projects where it played an incidental but necessary role, as long as the clearance of blighted areas and reconstruction and rehabilitation remained the primary purpose of its participation. The court further found that respondent complied with the requirement of N.Y. Em. Dom. Proc. Law &sect; 204 to specify the general effect on the environment of the proposed project, and had no duty under N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law art. 8, to undertake its own environmental review.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a proceeding to challenge the planned construction of a residence for the homeless on land currently owned by a municipality, even accepting as true petitioners' allegations that respondent State Urban Development Corporation (UDC) is merely &quot;lending&quot; its name and extraordinary powers to other parties who realistically have a primary stake and interest in the project greater than the UDC and that that is outside the scope of the UDC's authority, it does not necessarily follow that the UDC is acting in excess of its statutory jurisdiction and authority since the actions complained of are not only proper but precisely the sort of activity for which the UDC was created.  The UDC is not limited to projects in which it is the prime mover, and there is no bar to it taking part in projects where it plays an incidental but necessary role, as long as the clearance of blighted areas and reconstruction and rehabilitation remain the primary purpose of its participation.  Accordingly, inasmuch as the record amply supports the finding that the area in question is substandard and insanitary, and since there is no showing that the UDC determination under review was made corruptly, irrationally or baselessly, there is nothing for the courts to do about it.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Housing - Construction of Residence for Homeless - Office and Community Space - Land Acquisition Costs </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a proceeding to challenge the planned construction of a residence for the homeless on land currently owned by a municipality, there is no merit to petitioners' contention that since the project also envisions the construction of office and community space, it entails an illegal use of funds to be diverted from the Permanent Housing for Homeless Families (PHHF) program, since the funding of office and community space in the residential building is within both the spirit and express mandate of the Private Housing Finance Law &sect; 64 (5), which permits office and community space that is &quot;incidental and appurtenant&quot; to the housing. While the construction of the commercial building for the municipality at no cost would appear at first blush to be unconnected, the municipality will accept a nominal sum as consideration for the condemnation by the State Urban Development Corporation; the construction of the building is simply a delayed payment, thereby giving the agency charged with administering PHHF funds adequate grounds for considering the erection of the commercial building as permissible land acquisition costs </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Private Housing Finance Law &sect; 64 [6]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Housing - Construction of Residence for Homeless - Financial Feasibility - Expiration of Tax Credits </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a proceeding to challenge the planned construction of a residence for the homeless on land currently owned by a municipality, there is no merit to petitioners' objection that the plan has not been shown to be financially feasible: even if the desired tax credits are obtained, they will expire in about 15 years, while the project owner is obligated to run the project for 35 years to comply with Private Housing Finance Law &sect; 69 (1).  However, while the statute provides for project owners of not-for-profit corporations to be &quot;subject to such terms and conditions for a period of thirty-five years or such longer period as may be provided in the project description&quot;, there is no correlative requirement that the project owners must, at the initial stage, provide an exhaustive and completely detailed budget for 35 years covering all contingencies.  Moreover, judicial review is limited.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a proceeding to challenge the planned construction of a residence for the homeless on land currently owned by the City of New York, there is no merit to petitioners' contention that the exercise of the override powers of the State Urban Development Corporation (UDC) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McKinney's Uncons Laws of NY &sect; 6266 [3]) in its resolutions under review, which specifically superceded the City's Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP), was improper on the ground that UDC was not the lead agency on the project, since the fact that the UDC is not the prime mover behind the project is of no moment, and the fact that it is not the lead agency will not circumscribe its override powers.  While the UDC does have the right to override local laws, petitioners' contention that various sections of the City Charter and Zoning Resolutions are treated by the proposed project as void is meritless; thus, the prohibition against the sale of City-owned property, except at auction, is not overridden since the property is not being sold by the City but condemned by the UDC.  Similarly, the requirement that City facilities be equitably distributed throughout the City is inapplicable since the facility in question will be constructed and operated by a private not-for-profit corporation.  Finally, inasmuch as the building is being erected &quot;as of right&quot; there is no necessity for an &quot;override&quot; of the Zoning Resolution.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In a proceeding to challenge the planned construction of a residence for the homeless on land currently owned by a municipality, there is no merit to petitioners' contention that the notice promulgated by the State Urban Development Corporation (UDC), which will condemn the land, of its sale of the site to the not-for-profit corporation which will operate the residence was inadequate because, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it allegedly failed to fix the price for the sale.  McKinney's Unconsolidated Laws of New York &sect; 6256 (1) (c) governs the notice requirements of a sale by the UDC and a notice conforming with the statutory strictures was duly published, identifying the not-for-profit corporation as the transferee and reciting that the consideration was nominal; there were no other &quot;essential&quot; conditions placed upon the sale.  Even if there had been some technical violation of the statute, it would not affect the validity of the UDC's condemnation procedure, which is the only issue before the court.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eminent Domain - Condemnation by State Urban Development Corporation - Satisfaction of Procedural Requirements - SEQRA Review - Involved Agency </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In a proceeding to challenge the planned construction of a residence for the homeless on land currently owned by a municipality, respondent State Urban Development Corporation (UDC), which condemned the site where the residence will be erected, complied with the mandate of EDPL 204 by setting forth the specifications required as to each relevant paragraph of EDPL 204 (B).  Moreover, the UDC, which complied with the requirement to specify the general effect on the environment of the proposed project, had no duty under the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) to undertake its own environmental review simply because it was the sole State agency involved in the project having the power to condemn; rather, the UDC's determination and findings correctly noted that the State Housing Finance Agency (HFA), as the project's &quot;lead agency&quot;, had issued a &quot;negative declaration&quot;, and as an &quot;involved agency&quot;, the UDC was entitled to rely upon the determination of HFA, which has been closely involved with various aspects of the project.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation - Environmental Quality Review - Construction of Residence for Homeless </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The construction of a permanent residence for the homeless, which will also contain office and community space, is not exempt from the requirements of the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) on the ground that there is an emergency need to house the poor and homeless, since the project in question does not qualify as one necessary on a &quot;limited and temporary basis&quot; within the meaning of the implementing regulations.  Accordingly, the court must review whether the lead agency satisfied the mandate of SEQRA, i.e., took a &quot;hard look&quot; at the relevant areas of environmental concern and made a &quot;reasoned elaboration&quot; of the basis for its determination.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation - Environmental Quality Review - Negative Declaration </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. In a proceeding to challenge the construction of a permanent residence for the homeless, the &quot;negative declaration&quot; of environmental significance issued by the project's lead agency is adequately supported by the record which contains a photographic description of the project, a &quot;no impact&quot; letter from the State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, an environmental audit showing no evidence of significant chemical contamination, an environmental assessment form which revealed no significant adverse environmental effects, and statements of support for the project from local officials.  Under either the &quot;corrupt, irrational or baseless&quot; standard of review, or the &quot;illegal/arbitrary and capricious/abuse of discretion&quot; standard of review, petitioners, who object to the project, have failed to meet their burden of proof.  The lead agency identified the relevant areas of environmental concern, took a &quot;hard look&quot; at them, and made a reasoned elaboration of the basis for its determination.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Authorities - State Urban Development Corporation - Unconstitutional Delegation of Legislative Authority </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. There is no merit to the contention that the New York State Urban Development Act (L 1968, ch 174, &sect; 1) unconstitutionally delegates legislative authority to the State Urban Development Corporation (UDC) by allowing it to use its condemnation power to &quot;cut through&quot; not only the &quot;red tape&quot; of petty bureaucratic meddling or inaction, but also basic democratic processes and controls, since the UDC's powers stem from the State Constitution itself, and thus there is no constitutional infirmity in either the creation of UDC or its right to override local zoning laws.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Commissioner of New York City Department of Social Services (Commissioner) sought review of an order from the Family Court of Queens County (New York), which, in a child protective proceeding under N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 10, denied a motion to vacate a prior order that directed the Commissioner to file a termination of parental rights proceeding or directed her to afford legal representation to respondent foster mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner alleged that she was unable to bring a termination of parental rights proceeding because the foster child was never committed to her care, that there was no legal basis to provide legal representation to the foster mother, and that such a direction placed her in an untenable position because she could oppose the adoption. The court found (1) the foster mother and foster child fit the definitions of foster mother and child under N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 371(19); (2) N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 1055 provided all the statutory authority needed to direct the Commissioner to commence a termination of parental rights proceeding on the foster child's behalf, whether the foster child was placed by the Commissioner or by the court; (3) the N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act allowed for the assignment of counsel to the foster mother because of the nature of the judicial proceedings contemplated and such an assignment furthered the objectives of the N.Y. Fam.

Act; (4) the foster mother could be provided with assigned counsel in order to initiate a termination of parental rights proceeding to pursue an adoption; and (5) there was no ethical bar for the Commissioner to provide the legal services.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parent and Child - Abused or Neglected Child - Authority of Family Court to Order Commencement of Termination of Parental Rights Proceeding on Behalf of Child Directly Placed by Court </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a child protective proceeding in which the child was directly placed by the Family Court with his mother's friend, Family Court did not exceed its authority under Family Court Act &sect; 1055 in subsequently ordering the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Social Services to commence a termination of parental rights proceeding intended to free the child for adoption by his &quot;foster mother&quot;.  Family Court had the legal authority to place the child outside his family with such a &quot;suitable person&quot; (Family Ct Act &sect; 1055 [a]).  Under the statutory scheme, although no social services agency was responsible for the placement, the child nonetheless became a &quot;foster child&quot; in law as well as in fact, and the &quot;foster mother&quot; became his &quot;foster parent&quot; as those terms are defined in Social Services Law &sect; 371 (19).  Thus, the court's direction to commence the termination proceeding was not outside the authority granted to the Commissioner by Social Services Law &sect; 384-b, which concerns actions that may be taken with regard to foster children.  For purposes of Family Court Act &sect; 1055 (d), which authorizes the court to &quot;make an order directing a social services official ... to institute a proceeding to legally free the [foster] child for adoption, if the court finds reasonable cause to believe that grounds therefor exist&quot;, there is no reason to distinguish between a foster child who is not placed by or with a social welfare agency from one directly placed by the court in a home not certified under applicable law.  Since the court has the power to place the child in such an environment under Family Court Act &sect; 1055 (a), and to continue such placement pursuant to subdivision (b), it must also be presumed to have the power to direct the initiation of proceedings to free the child for adoption by a foster parent caring for him in that home.  If the court did not have such power, there would be a danger of the &quot;foster care limbo&quot; the statutory scheme is designed to avoid.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parent and Child - Abused or Neglected Child - Authority of Family Court to Direct Commissioner of Social Services to Represent Foster Parent in Adoption Proceeding </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a child protective proceeding in which the child was directly placed by the Family Court outside his family with his mother's friend, Family Court did not exceed its authority in subsequently directing the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Social Services to provide legal representation to the &quot;foster mother&quot; to aid her in instituting an adoption proceeding in the event the Commissioner failed to timely comply with the court's order pursuant to Family Court Act &sect; 1055 to commence a termination of parental rights proceeding.  In view of the highly interrelated nature of termination and adoption proceedings, where, as here, the same indigent person is prosecuting both a termination of parental rights proceeding and an adoption proceeding, such person is entitled to assigned counsel pursuant to Family Court Act &sect; 262 (a) (iv) with respect to both the termination of parental rights and the adoption proceedings.  To hold otherwise would frustrate one of the central policy goals set forth in Social Services Law &sect; 384-b of finding a normal permanent home for children as early as possible where the natural parent cannot or will not provide such a home.  Furthermore, naming the Commissioner as the provider of the legal services in this case instead of assigned counsel will not place the Commissioner in an &quot;untenable position&quot; in the event opposition to the adoption arises.  A direction to aid the custodial parent in adopting, like the order to institute proceedings to legally free the child for adoption, does not involve any unconstitutional interference with the Commissioner's exercise of independent judgment or discretion with regard to the child.  Finally, the direction to aid the &quot;foster mother&quot; in adopting the child by providing legal representation furthers the objectives of the Family Court Act.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Supreme Court (New York) denied a motion for summary judgment filed by defendant, the City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (the Department), in an action brought by plaintiff tenants in which the tenants claimed they did not receive proper notice of building renovations and prospective rent increases.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenants' landlord applied to the Department for a participation loan pursuant to N.Y. Priv. Hous. Fin. Law &sect; 800 et seq.&nbsp;N.Y. Priv. Hous. Fin. Law &sect; 804 required the Department to restructure the rents when the refurbishment was achieved and N.Y. Hous. Fin.

This was accomplished by letter from the landlord and subsequent reminder of rental increases. The tenants were later told that rehabilitation was substantially complete and that the restructured rents, as previously announced, would become effective. Not until the rental increases were about to become effective did the tenants file the current action objecting to the notification process and rental increases. The court found the tenants' allegations unsupported and held that the tenants were provided due process and had no claim against the Department where they never submitted any objections until after the rehabilitation was substantially completed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court judgment and granted the Department's motion for summary judgment because the Department provided the tenants with adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard on the issue of rental housing increases.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landlord and Tenant - Rent Regulation - Due Process Right to Notice of Rent Increase under Loan Program for Rehabilitated Housing </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an action for declaratory and injunctive relief in which plaintiffs, the tenants of six five-story buildings renovated under a loan program administered by the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) pursuant to Private Housing Finance Law &sect; 800 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> allege that they were not accorded constitutionally adequate notice of HPD's determination that the work was complete nor given an opportunity to challenge that determination and comment on the prospective rent increases, defendants' motion for summary judgment dismissing the first and second causes of action should have been granted.  Under the statutory scheme, once the refurbishment has been achieved, rents are initially established by HPD at levels deemed sufficient to pay for the work done and to permit the dwelling to be properly maintained.  Rent-controlled apartments are decontrolled and the entire building is then placed in the rent stabilization system.  Even assuming that plaintiffs are endowed with a constitutionally protected property interest in the rent control and rent stabilization laws, there is no indication that their right to due process was in any way violated.  The tenants herein were informed of the intended renovations and the anticipated rent restructuring two years before the new rents went into effect and were notified of the proposed rent rises at least twice in writing and once in person but never submitted any objections until after the rehabilitation had been substantially completed and they were advised that the new rents would soon go into effect.  Under the circumstances, the notice available to the tenants cannot be deemed to be constitutionally defective. Finally, to the extent that the tenants are disputing the propriety of the increases in relation to the adequacy of the rehabilitation work actually performed, HPD's determination should have been challenged in a CPLR article 78 proceeding, and if the tenants are dissatisfied with the quality of their services or condition of their dwellings, they have the option of petitioning the Department of Housing and Community Renewal for a rent reduction or pleading abatement in any rent proceeding commenced against them.  </SPAN></P>

The health organizations argued that, because the PCAP did not encompass allowances for medically necessary abortions for the same class of women, the statute of unconstitutional. The lower court agreed, and found that it unconstitutionally discriminated against women's right to reproductive freedom because the PCAP impermissibly steered indigent women toward childbirth when it paid all related expenses, but none of those associated with terminating a pregnancy. The trial court ordered that the program be expanded to include funds for medically necessary abortions. This decision was stayed pending appeal. On appeal, the court agreed with the lower court, and found that the legislature violated N.Y. Const. art.

The legislative classification, which limits the use of money to assure a healthy delivery and recovery, does not withstand strict scrutiny since the State's interest in advancing the cause of healthy mothers bearing healthy babies has no reasonable relationship to the statutory abortion exclusion.  The promotion of healthy births is not enhanced by requiring poor women to give birth regardless of the medical implications.  PCAP, by excluding funding for therapeutic abortions, has the practical effect of being a measure that supports childbirth, sometimes at the expense of the mother's health, thereby rendering the statute in conflict with the requirement that government actions must be constitutionally neutral in affecting the exercise of fundamental rights.  Having acknowledged that pregnant women with family incomes between 100 and 185% of the poverty level are &quot;needy&quot; and require help in obtaining pregnancy-related health services, the Legislature violated the State constitutional obligations to aid, care and support the needy (NY Const, art XVII, &sect; 1), and to promote the health of the State's citizens (NY Const, art XVII, &sect; 3) by conditioning aid to this needy class on a standard totally unconnected to need or health; that is, whether an otherwise eligible woman undergoes an abortion or gives birth. Consistent with the dominant sentiment of the Legislature, the constitutional defect in PCAP is best remedied by expanding the ambit of the program to include funding for medically indicated abortions rather than voiding the law in its entirety.  </SPAN></P>

Inherent in the right to privacy is the right of an individual to make free choices concerning procreation, contraception and sexual activity.  Once the State assumed the responsibility of helping needy, pregnant women, it was required to do so in a neutral nondiscriminatory manner that does not coerce poor women into choosing childbirth even at the expense of their health and well-being.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was stuck by a needle contaminated with the blood of an AIDS patient as a result of the failure of the correction officers to intervene in the hospital employees' struggle with the inmate/patient. The lower court found that the state breached its duty to provide reasonable security to the hospital staff and that the state's negligence was the sole proximate cause of claimants' injuries. On appeal, the court held that the damages awarded to the claimant were reasonable. However, the court that the lower court erred in limiting claimant's future economic loss to her postinjury life expectancy. The court held that where the proof in the record permits the loss to be ascertained with reasonable certainty, damages attributable to an injured person's lost earning capacity due to injury must be awarded directly to that person during his or her lifetime utilizing a preinjury life expectancy.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Damages - Inadequate and Excessive Damages - AIDS - Loss of Consortium </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a negligence action in which the State was held liable for the injuries sustained by claimant, a hospital nurse, who became infected with AIDS when she was stuck by a contaminated needle after two State correction officers refused to help restrain an inmate being treated at the hospital, the $ 4,250,000 aggregate award made for claimant's past ($ 750,000) and future ($ 3,500,000) pain and suffering is not excessive (CPLR 5501 [c]) in view of claimant's lessened life expectancy and the suffering that will attend her death from AIDS.  In addition, the award of $ 250,000 for past and $ 750,000 for claimant's husband's future loss of consortium properly reflects the emotional, physical and financial contributions that claimant has made during the course of the parties' marriage, including the services she has rendered in caring for the household and assisting with their three children.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Damages - Lost Earnings - Future Economic Loss - Award Based upon Preinjury Life Expectancy </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a negligence action in which the State was held liable for the injuries sustained by claimant, a hospital nurse who became infected with AIDS when she was stuck by a contaminated needle after two State correction officers refused to help restrain an inmate being treated at the hospital, the Court of Claims erred in limiting claimant's future economic loss to her postinjury life expectancy and determining that claimant's distributees could be compensated for any loss beyond claimant's reasonable postinjury life expectancy by bringing a wrongful death action. Where, as here, the economic and medical proof in the record permits the loss to be ascertained with reasonable certainty, damages attributable to an injured person's lost earning capacity due to injury must be awarded directly to that person during his or her lifetime utilizing a preinjury life expectancy. Based on the proof in this case, claimant, who was 42 years of age at the time of trial and earning approximately $ 30,000 annually, will likely become completely disabled from AIDS in 1996.  Claimant has a reasonable work-life expectancy as a registered nurse through the age of 58.  Utilizing the calculations offered by the expert economists and making allowances for lost fringe benefits as a percentage of income and without any adjustment for claimant's personal consumption, the impairment of earnings and lost wage component of claimant's future economic loss is determined to be $ 450,000.  Additionally, the value of claimant's services as a homemaker is determined to be $ 275,000.  Accordingly, the judgment should be modified to provide for such an award and the matter remitted to the Court of Claims for purposes of determining the amount of the judgment to be entered pursuant to CPLR 5041 (e).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Damages - Structured Judgment - Constitutionality of Statutory Periodic Payment Provision - No Violation of Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The periodic payment provision of CPLR article 50-B requiring future damage awards in excess of $ 250,000 to be paid over a period of time instead of in one lump sum does not unconstitutionally deprive claimants of their property without due process of law in this negligence action in which the State was held liable for the injuries sustained by a hospital nurse who became infected with AIDS when she was stuck by a contaminated needle after two State correction officers refused to help restrain an inmate being treated at the hospital.  Article 50-B was intended to maintain the moderate cost of liability insurance premiums, while assuring adequate compensation for tort victims throughout the entire period of their loss.  Since the Legislature was acting in furtherance of permissible State objectives and the means adopted in article 50-B reasonably relate to their accomplishment, the abolition of the right of a tort victim to receive an award for future damages in a lump sum does not deprive that victim of a right or interest protected by the Due Process Clause of the State Constitution (NY Const, art I, &sect; 6).  Furthermore, since the term &quot;discount rate&quot; as used in article 50-B can be determined with reasonable certainty, the statute is not unconstitutionally vague. In providing that present value determinations are to be made &quot;in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices by applying the discount rate in effect at the time of the award&quot; (CPLR 5041 [e]), the Legislature merely provided for a flexible approach to such determinations.  Finally, application of article 50-B to claimants' award does not violate the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 USC &sect; 12101 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since, even if the Act applies to a situation such as presented by this case, its provisions are not implicated here because there is no causal nexus between the alleged discriminatory action and the disabled individual's disability. </SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 11-2502(a)(3) (1986) to be a valid legislative enactment in the corporation's declaratory judgment action against respondent Commissioner of Finance of the City of New York.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner promulgated New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 11-2502(a)(3) (1986), which imposed a five percent tax on a reduced room rate utilizing the full day rate. The corporation brought an action against the Commissioner challenging the validity of the enactment. The trial court entered judgment declaring the provision to be valid, which the court affirmed in its original opinion. The court granted reargument, and it subsequently recalled and vacated its original opinion and issued a superceding opinion and order. In its superceding opinion, the court reversed the trial court's judgment, ruling that the Commissioner exceeded his authority in promulgating &sect; 11-2502(a)(3). The court held that the enabling legislation contained in 1980 N.Y. Laws 253 specifically authorized a graduated schedule for taxing short-stay occupancies, which was inconsistent with the flat percentage rate established in New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 11-2502(a)(3) (1986). Further, the 1986 amendment to the enabling act, 1986 N.Y. Laws 219, contained no short-stay tax.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school principal sought review of an order of the Dutchess County Family Court (New York), dismissing appellant's petition in a proceeding to declare respondent youth as a person in need of supervision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school principal petitioned, under the Family Court Act art. 7, to declare respondent youth as a person in need of supervision (PINS). The contentions of the petition were based upon school records. Respondent moved to dismiss, contending that the petition was based upon hearsay statements. The court granted the motion to dismiss, finding that a PINS petition should incorporate a nonhearsay requirement upon due process grounds. On appeal, the court reinstated the petition and remanded. Considering the requirements of procedural due process, the court concluded that a petition based upon hearsay statements could be used to support a PINS proceeding. The Family Court Act's provisions provided reliability and adequate notice to respondent, and the addition of a nonhearsay requirement would not significantly strengthen those provisions but might chill petitioners' efforts to secure assistance for a respondent. Using the rational basis standard of review, the court concluded that respondent's equal protection argument failed because the PINS proceeding and the juvenile delinquent proceeding, which required nonhearsay statements, were different in nature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order, reinstated the petition, and remitted for further proceedings; due process and equal protection concerns did not require that a &quot;person in need of supervision&quot; petition rest upon nonhearsay statements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Infants - Persons in Need of Supervision - Sufficiency of Petition </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A petition based on hearsay allegations is constitutionally permissible in a proceeding under Family Court Act article 7 to adjudicate a person in need of supervision (PINS), even though a juvenile delinquency petition under Family Court Act article 3 must be based on nonhearsay allegations.  Family Court Act &sect; 732 requires only that the petition in a PINS proceeding specify &quot;the acts on which the allegations are based and the time and place they allegedly occurred&quot;.  Due process does not dictate that the allegations in a PINS petition be in nonhearsay form.  Even before the petition is filed, respondent has been advised at a mandatory assessment conference of the source of the allegations against him and the particular conduct at issue.  The imposition of a nonhearsay requirement might interfere with the State's goal of providing an informal procedure whereby youths at risk of committing more serious acts receive appropriate rehabilitation and treatment; to require a PINS petition to provide sworn statements from others to support the various acts of misconduct specified in the petition would be unduly burdensome and could act as a barrier preventing parents or others unversed in the court system from seeking assistance.  Moreover, respondent's right to equal protection of the laws was not violated.  No suspect category is involved in the distinction between respondents in PINS and juvenile delinquency proceedings, and the distinction between hearsay and nonhearsay petitions has no effect on a respondent's liberty interest. The discretionary decision to detain a PINS respondent prior to the fact-finding hearing may not be predicated on the hearsay allegations of the petition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Family Ct Act &sect; 739), and although the ultimate disposition in a PINS proceeding may involve a deprivation of liberty after a fact-finding hearing, the disposition is not affected by the hearsay nature of the petition.  The hearsay form of a PINS petition is consistent with the objective of providing a more informal procedure for those respondents whose conduct does not rise to the level of criminal conduct at issue in a juvenile delinquency proceeding.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that the amount of cocaine involved and defendant's admitted knowing possession did not amount to one of the &quot;rare cases&quot; in which the application of the statute constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court found that the sentence imposed was not harsh or excessive because defendant admitted to the facts, was allowed to plead guilty to a lesser crime, and agreed to the sentence as a part of a negotiated plea bargain. In vacating the sentence, the court held that the trial court failed to exercise its independent judgment in imposing the sentence.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action against the State to recover for injuries and wrongful death arising out of the shooting of three police officers by a parolee, the State, through the Attorney-General, who takes the anomalous position of attacking the constitutionality of an amendment to General Municipal Law &sect; 205-e providing for the revival of claims such as those at bar, may not be heard to complain that the retroactive law which it enacted is void as a violation of due process.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action against the State to recover for injuries and wrongful death arising out of the shooting of three police officers by a parolee, the State's contention that an amendment to General Municipal Law &sect; 205-e, which revived claims such as those at bar, is inapplicable and that any legislative attempt to revive such claims is unconstitutional since it contravenes the prohibition against the gift or loan of State money (NY Const, art VII, &sect; 8), or the audit, allowance or payment of time-barred claims (NY Const, art III, &sect; 19), is unavailing since the only final determination on the merits of the instant action was made by the Appellate Division when it held that claimants' common-law claim was barred by the &quot;fireman's rule&quot; as applied in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Santangelo v State of New York</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (71 NY2d 393). Although the original 1989 version of section 205-e, which created the cause of action in favor of police officers, was before the Appellate Division, that Court merely held that it could not be retroactively applied in accordance with the general rules of statutory construction. Accordingly, the Court did not reach the question of the statute's applicability to the case at bar.  The statute does not constitute a gift or loan of State money, inasmuch as there is nothing specifically addressed to the State, nor does it constitute the allowance of a time-barred claim.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In an action against the State to recover for injuries and wrongful death arising out of the shooting of three police officers by a parolee, the enactment of an amendment to General Municipal Law &sect; 205-e, which provided for the revival of claims of police officers which had been created by the original version of the statute, did not violate constitutional proscriptions against gifts or loans of State money or the allowance of time- barred claims </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art VII, &sect; 8; art III, &sect; 19), since the State is no different than any other defendant against whom a claim under the new section could be asserted; nor is it in any different position than it has been since 1935 vis-a-vis firefighters. Merely because a statute establishing a right to recover against the State is retroactive does not render it unconstitutional; indeed the treatment of retrospective laws as a distinct constitutional issue is inappropriate since there is no constitutional prohibition against them except for Federal proscriptions against bills of attainder and ex post facto laws.  Rather, there is a strong public interest in bringing police officers into parity with firefighters. The obvious intent of the Legislature was to provide claimants' class with a day in court, and there is no question that claimants' claim was still pending and had not been reduced to final judgment as of the date of the amendment in question.  </SPAN></P>

The survivor of a homosexual relationship, alleged to be a &quot;spousal relationship&quot;, is not entitled to a right of election against the decedent's will, pursuant to EPTL 5-1.1, since the Legislature has expressly defined a &quot;surviving spouse&quot; as a husband or wife, and, even in the absence of such express definition, an interpretation of the statute to the same effect would be warranted, given the fact that the language of a statute is to be construed according to its natural and most obvious sense and in accordance with its ordinary and accepted meaning. Although the Court of Appeals has held that same-sex partners were &quot;family members&quot; for purposes of rent control regulations prohibiting certain evictions, that Court subsequently held that a lesbian partner was not a &quot;parent&quot; under the Domestic Relations Law. Accordingly, the term &quot;surviving spouse&quot; as used in EPTL 5-1.1 cannot be interpreted to include homosexual life partners. </SPAN></P>

Purported homosexual marriages do not give rise to any rights pursuant to section 5-1.1 and no constitutional rights are abrogated or violated in so holding.  Any equal protection analysis is to be measured by the rational basis standard, i.e., the legislation is presumed to be valid and will be sustained if the classification drawn is rationally related to a legitimate State interest, and the classification in question is neither irrational nor invidious.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Standing - Constitutionality of Law Creating Village School District to Meet Religious Needs </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondents, the New York State School Boards Association and two of its officers in their capacity as representatives of the Association, lack standing to challenge the constitutionality of a law creating a Village School District for a Village of Hasidic Jews in an effort to provide public funding for special educational services for the nonpublic school handicapped children of the Village (L 1989, ch 748) since the Association itself is not a citizen-taxpayer within the meaning of State Finance Law article 7-A nor has it sustained any injury in fact.  In addition, the Association has not met the requirements for associational or organizational standing since, as units of municipal government, the Association's member school boards do not have the substantive right to raise constitutional challenges to a State statute, particularly in the absence of any claim that compliance with the statute will force one or more of the member school boards to violate a constitutional proscription.  However, the Association's officers have standing in their individual capacities as citizen-taxpayers to maintain this action under State Finance Law &sect; 123-b (1) for declaratory or injunctive relief to prevent the unconstitutional disbursement of State funds.  The Village District created by chapter 748 will receive State funding and, therefore, the constitutionality of that statute can be challenged in a citizen-taxpayer action.  Furthermore, the fact that the action was discontinued as to the State officials when the two school districts involved intervened as party defendants does not affect the individual plaintiffs' standing since the expenditure of State funds remains an issue and the Attorney-General continues to appear in the action pursuant to Executive Law &sect; 71.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Establishment of Religion - Constitutionality of Law Creating Village School District to Meet Religious Needs </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A law creating a Village School District for a Village of Hasidic Jews in an effort to provide public funding for special educational services for the Village's nonpublic school handicapped children (L 1989, ch 748) is unconstitutional as violative of the Establishment of Religion Clause of the State and Federal Constitutions (NY Const, art XI, &sect; 3; US Const 1st Amend).  The challenged statute was designed not merely to provide special educational services to the handicapped children of the Village, but to provide those services within the Village so that the children would remain subject to the language, lifestyle and environment created by the religious community and avoid mixing with children whose language, lifestyle and environment are not the product of that religion. Even if the statute has a secular purpose, its principal or primary effect still impermissibly advances religion. The impermissible effect is the symbolic impact of creating a new school district coterminous with a religious community to provide educational services that were already available in an effort to resolve a dispute between the religious community and the school district within which the community was formerly located, a dispute based upon the language, lifestyle and environment of the community's children created by the religious tenets, practices and beliefs of the community.  All of the parents' secular concerns regarding the adequacy of the special educational services offered by the former school district for children with &quot;special psychological vulnerabilities&quot; to &quot;exposure to the outside world&quot; could have been addressed in the administrative and judicial review process for handicapped children (Education Law &sect; 4404).  </SPAN></P>

As part of the plea bargain, defendant waived his right to appeal.

Further, the court rejected defendant's claim that there was no evidence that he intended to cause serious physical injury or that he caused such injury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer pulled over a vehicle. The trunk contained a suitcase. The officer testified that the passenger told the officer he needed to speak with defendant, the driver, to obtain the suitcase's combination lock number. The passenger and defendant fled. The suitcase contained heroin and cocaine. The trial court charged the jury on the presumption of knowing possession, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 220.25(1) (stating that the presence of drugs in a vehicle created a presumption of knowing possession by all in the vehicle). The court held that admission of the officer's testimony as a statement made by a co-conspirator violated defendant's right of confrontation. The court held that the statement was not reliable. However, the court held that because the proof of guilt was overwhelming, the error was harmless. The presumption was permissible if there was a rational connection between the known fact proven and the ultimate fact presumed. That connection was shown by the facts that the key to the suitcase was in the vehicle, defendant slammed shut the trunk and sped away, a witness saw defendant throw the suitcase into the river, and the suitcase contained a large amount of narcotics.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Harmless and Prejudicial Error - Admission of Codefendant's Statement </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a criminal prosecution for possession of controlled substances, arising out of an incident wherein an automobile driven by defendant was stopped by a State Trooper and heroin and cocaine were ultimately discovered in a suitcase which defendant removed from the trunk of the vehicle and threw off a bridge after he and a companion fled from the Trooper who had stopped them, the trial court erred in admitting the statement of defendant's companion to the Trooper that he had to talk with defendant to get the combination to the suitcase. Since the companion had a very strong motive to lie to convince the Trooper that defendant had control over the suitcase, the statement does not bear sufficient indicia of reliability to justify its admission in the absence of cross-examination, and because the admission of the statement violated defendant's right to confrontation, its admission was an error of constitutional dimension.  However, in light of the overwhelming proof of defendant's guilt, the admission of the statement was harmless.  </SPAN></P>

The presumption is not unconstitutional as applied if there is a rational connection between the known fact proven by the prosecution and the ultimate fact presumed. Here, there was such a rational connection, since defendant was driving the vehicle when it was stopped, the lock mechanism to open the trunk was located on the driver's door, and the key to the suitcase was inside the vehicle.  Under those circumstances, it was rational to presume that defendant had both the ability and the intent to exercise dominion and control over the drugs in the trunk. </SPAN></P>

The Trooper's identification of the suitcase, combined with the evidence that the suitcase was discovered downstream from the bridge, was sufficient to prove that it was the same one that was in the trunk of defendant's vehicle, and the evidence, including the statutory presumption of possession (Penal Law &sect; 220.25 [1]) and defendant's actions in fleeing, was likewise sufficient to support the jury's determination that defendant knowingly possessed the drugs in the trunk. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a criminal prosecution for possession of controlled substances, defendant's contention that certain prosecutorial remarks in the opening statement and during cross-examination deprived him of a fair trial was not preserved for appellate review since defendant failed to object at trial. Although the remarks were improper and the prosecutor's attempts to appeal to the possible racial bias of jurors should not be condoned, the conviction should not be reversed in the interest of justice, since the comments were isolated and did not amount to a persistent pattern of racial references.  </SPAN></P>

The taxpayer was further required to file an application for a refund.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord was the owner of a four-story row house which, at all times since purchased by her, had two apartments occupied by rent-controlled tenants who had a perpetual right to remain in possession subject to rent control by reason of their age or longevity in occupancy. The landlord alleged that she no longer wished to be a landlord and challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 26-408 of the New York City Rent and Rehabitation Law, New York City, N.Y., Admin.

In 1990, the department filed a warrant against the taxpayer. In 1991 the taxpayer filed a complaint, seeking judgment declaring the warrant null and void. The trial court denied the taxpayer's motion for summary judgment and held that the taxpayer was liable for penalties and interest under N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1145.

In an action seeking a declaration that a tax warrant, filed against plaintiff by defendant State Division of Taxation pursuant to Tax Law &sect; 1141 (b), is null and void on the ground that the Division cannot issue a warrant against plaintiff personally for unpaid corporate sales taxes when it had never been determined in any proceeding that plaintiff was a &quot;person liable for the tax&quot;, Supreme Court erred in denying plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, since Tax Law &sect; 1133, 1131 (1) do not provide sufficient authority to permit the Division to issue a warrant against plaintiff as a &quot;person liable for the tax&quot;.  An administrative determination of whether a person is a &quot;person liable&quot; was never available and a judicial determination was never sought; therefore, the Division had no legal foundation upon which to issue a warrant, and the only &quot;person liable&quot; against which defendant could proceed was the delinquent corporation </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Tax Law &sect; 1101 [a]).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district established dual tax rates for the portion of the town of Lewiston within its taxing authority, even though the town of Lewiston had not established dual rates. The school district established dual rates pursuant to N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law 1901(x), which allowed the district to establish dual tax rates for all parcels within the district, so long as one-third of the parcels within the school district were located within the town of Niagra, which had adopted a dual rate structure. In a declaratory judgment action, the court rejected the taxpayers' claim that there was no rational basis for the legislature's use of the one-third fraction or number of parcels as the criteria that allowed the school district to adopt dual rates on a district wide basis. The court determined that the one-third criteria was designed as a threshold figure to encourage revaluation in cases when fewer parcels had been revaluated and that the number of parcels criteria provided an objective standard that was easy to apply. The court also held that the dual classification was reasonable because it ensured stability, and the taxes imposed across the nonhomestead property class were uniform.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, plaintiffs' counsel acknowledged that the tax rates for nonhomestead taxpayers throughout the district were &quot;presumably equalized&quot;.  The challenged legislation is not unconstitutional on the ground that it allegedly enables the school district to impose a greater tax burden upon nonhomestead taxpayers within the district than upon nonhomestead taxpayers in the same towns but whose property is situated in another school district, since plaintiffs and other nonhomestead taxpayers within the subject school district are not &quot;similarly situated&quot; with nonhomestead taxpayers in other school districts.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation and defendants, a husband and a wife, both filed motions for summary judgment. The Supreme Court in the County of Westchester (New York) denied both the corporation's motion and the husband's and the wife's cross application for summary judgment, but held that the necessaries doctrine should have been expanded to impose liability upon wives for necessaries furnished to their husbands. The husband and the wife appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and the wife contended that the common-law doctrine of necessaries should have been abolished because it was unconstitutional, and that neither the husband nor the wife should have been held liable for medical expenses incurred by the other spouse. The corporation agreed that the necessaries doctrine in its historical form was unconstitutional, but contended that the unconstitutionality of the common-law rule should have been remedied by expanding it to impose liability upon wives for necessaries provided to their husbands. The court found that as traditionally formulated, the necessaries doctrine violated the Equal Protection Clause, and that the unconstitutionality of the necessaries doctrine should have been remedied by extending the common-law rule to both spouses. The court held that it was the spouse who received the necessary goods or services who should have been primarily liable for payment. The court concluded that a creditor seeking to recover a debt against the nondebtor spouse retained the burden of demonstrating that necessaries were furnished on the nondebtor spouse's credit, and that the nondebtor spouse had the ability to satisfy the debt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Husband and Wife - Necessaries - Equal Protection of Laws - Reciprocal Nature of Doctrine of Necessaries </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The common-law doctrine of necessaries, pursuant to which a husband is liable to third parties who furnish his wife with such &quot;necessaries&quot; as food, clothing, shelter, and medical care, violates the Equal Protection Clause because, while it makes a husband responsible for certain goods and services provided to his wife, it does not impose a similar obligation upon her.  The common-law rule should be extended to both spouses, and it is the spouse who received the necessary goods or services who should be primarily liable for payment; a creditor seeking to recover a debt against the nondebtor spouse retains the burden of demonstrating that necessaries were furnished on the nondebtor spouse's credit, and that the nondebtor spouse has the ability to satisfy the debt.  Retaining the common-law rule and applying it in a gender-neutral fashion would encourage the extension of credit to dependent spouses who, in an individual capacity, might lack the ability to purchase necessities or to obtain adequate medical care; the necessaries doctrine has historically facilitated support of the family, and expansion of the doctrine to require spouses to mutually share the obligation of furnishing necessaries is fully consistent with 1980 statutory amendments which make the duty of a wife to support her husband equal to that of a husband to support his wife, and the duty of a mother to support her children equal to the duty of the father to support his children.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A county law governing certain aspects of video display terminal (VDT) equipment usage among employers doing business within the county is preempted by the New York State Labor Law and, therefore, invalid, since the enacting of a comprehensive and detailed regulatory scheme embodied in the Labor Law and the vesting of broad rule-making and enforcement authority in the State Commissioner of Labor lead to the conclusion that the State Legislature intended to preclude local regulation in the field of employee safety in the workplace </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Labor Law &sect; 21, 27, 30), to the extent that that field is not already regulated by the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.  The intent to occupy an entire field of regulation need not be express, and it is well settled that inconsistency may be found, even in the absence of an express conflict, where the State Legislature has evinced a desire to preempt a given field and thereby to prohibit local regulation of the entire area.  In effect, the regulatory scheme set up by the Labor Law with regard to employee health and safety is so comprehensive and detailed as to render said local law &quot;inconsistent&quot; with State law under New York Constitution, article IX, &sect; 2 (c) (ii) and Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 10 (1) (ii).  </SPAN></P>

A county law governing certain aspects of video display terminal (VDT) equipment usage among employers doing business within the county is preempted by the State Labor Law and, therefore, invalid, and the fact that Labor Law &sect; 21 (9) provides that the Commissioner of Labor may enforce any lawful municipal ordinance or regulation relating to any place affected by the Labor Law and not in conflict therewith, does not preclude a finding of State preemption of the field of employee safety in the workplace, since, in view of the reference to &quot;any place&quot;, section 21 (9) should be construed as meaning only that the Commissioner may enforce local building, sanitation, and fire codes, etc., affecting premises </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see also,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Labor Law &sect; 200 [4]; &sect; 471).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Home Rule Powers - Regulation of Video Display Terminals in Workplace - Silence of State Labor Law </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A county law governing certain aspects of video display terminal (VDT) equipment usage among employers doing business within the county is preempted by the State Labor Law and, therefore, invalid, notwithstanding the fact that the Labor Law is silent on this specific subject.  Inasmuch as the Labor Law preempts the field of workplace safety, it permits, by reason of its silence, the operation of VDTs without any special regulations or safeguards. Hence, the County law in question impermissibly prohibits what the State law permits by providing that the use of VDTs must be accompanied by a panoply of safeguards which the State Legislature and the Commissioner of Labor have not seen fit to enact. Moreover, the County law does contain several provisions which touch upon matters already governed by the Labor Law, viz., vision examinations, noise, and lighting.  Thus, the County law improperly attempts to add another layer of regulation in an area where comprehensive and detailed regulations already exist at the State level.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for second degree murder. After his motions to dismiss the indictment were denied, he pled guilty and was convicted of the charge against him. Defendant appealed and asserted that instances of police and prosecutorial misconduct survived his plea and mandated the dismissal of the indictment. The court found that the guilty plea was valid because the evidence showed that it was made voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Plea of Guilty - Forfeiture of Right to Raise Issues on Appeal - Alleged Police and Prosecutorial Misconduct </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a homicide prosecution in which defendant negotiated a guilty plea to manslaughter in the second degree, defendant's contentions on appeal regarding alleged police and prosecutorial misconduct do not involve fundamental defects which deprived the court of jurisdiction or constituted such an egregious violation of basic rights as to effectively render the proceedings a nullity; rather, defendant's contentions come under that broad grouping of claims which are forfeited by a plea of guilty. The claims which have been forfeited by defendant's guilty plea are: eavesdropping by police with respect to a brief portion of a taped interview between defendant and his attorney; the test-firing and consequent destruction of a &quot;live&quot; bullet recovered from the rifle which defendant used to shoot the victim; the purported &quot;staging&quot; of a photograph of the rifle and its submission to the Grand Jury; and the elicitation of opinion testimony from a nonexpert witness during the Grand Jury proceedings.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Plea of Guilty - Forfeiture of Right to Raise Issues on Appeal - Police Eavesdropping with Regard to Tape of Conversation between Defendant and Counsel </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a homicide prosecution in which defendant negotiated a guilty plea to manslaughter in the second degree, defendant waived his right to contend that the indictment must be dismissed on the ground that eavesdropping by the police with respect to a brief portion of a taped interview between defendant and counsel constituted misconduct so egregious as to constitute a perversion of defendant's fundamental rights, where the record does not support that contention.  The police listened to only a two or three minute excerpt of the tape, allegedly because the officer suspected that the tape recorder was voice activated and might have recorded police conversations, and defendant could not establish that he suffered any prejudice as a result of the eavesdropping.  Such a showing of prejudice is a prerequisite for dismissal of the indictment. Thus, by pleading guilty, defendant himself foreclosed any possibility of demonstrating that the police misconduct would impair his trial rights or defense strategy.  Therefore, defendant's contention cannot be said to constitute such a deprivation of fundamental rights as to survive his guilty plea. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Plea of Guilty - Forfeiture of Right to Raise Issues on Appeal - Exhibition of &quot;Staged&quot; Photograph of Rifle to Grand Jury </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a homicide prosecution in which defendant negotiated a guilty plea to manslaughter in the second degree, defendant waived his right to contend that the indictment must be dismissed on the ground that the police committed egregious misconduct by &quot;staging&quot; a photograph of the rifle defendant used to shoot the victim and then exhibiting that photograph to the Grand Jury, since defendant's contention is disingenuous in light of the fact that a police investigator merely prevented the ejection of a spent cartridge from the rifle so that a photograph which depicted the actual contents of the weapon could be taken.  Moreover, the investigator fully explained the operation of the rifle, including its automatic ejection feature, to the Grand Jury.  Hence, the issue was fully developed in the Grand Jury proceedings and there is no basis to conclude that the police or the prosecutor were attempting to mislead the Grand Jury by the introduction of the photograph. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Plea of Guilty - Forfeiture of Right to Raise Issues on Appeal - Elicitation of Opinion Testimony from Nonexpert Witness </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a homicide prosecution in which defendant negotiated a guilty plea to second degree manslaughter, defendant's contention that a police investigator improperly gave opinion testimony before the Grand Jury is based upon a distorted perception of the facts: while the investigator was not qualified as an expert on firearms, he did state that as a nine-year veteran of the police force, he had received extensive training in firearms and handled them on a routine basis in investigating crime scenes.  Additionally, he thoroughly examined the rifle defendant used to shoot the victim and demonstrated a clear familiarity with the manner in which it operated. Accordingly, the investigator's competency to testify regarding the operation of the rifle and to respond to hypothetical questions concerning the use of the weapon are not open to serious challenge.  Therefore, it cannot be said that the purported errors so tainted the proceedings as to warrant appellate review notwithstanding defendant's guilty plea. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grand Jury - Defective Proceeding - Impairment of Integrity </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In a homicide prosecution involving the allegedly accidental shooting of the victim by defendant with a rifle, defendant's contention that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct during the Grand Jury proceedings by placing a &quot;staged&quot; photograph of the rifle in evidence and by eliciting opinion testimony from a nonexpert witness has been forfeited by his plea of guilty to second degree manslaughter, inasmuch as his allegations clearly do not support the conclusion that the integrity of the Grand Jury proceedings was impaired.  No egregious misconduct was involved and any limited police impropriety did not rise to the level of pervasive and fundamental unfairness which would warrant dismissal of the indictment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Plea of Guilty - Forfeiture of Right to Raise Issues on Appeal - Police Tampering with Weapon Used to Shoot Victim </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In a homicide prosecution in which defendant negotiated a guilty plea to second degree manslaughter, defendant's contention that the indictment should be dismissed owing to police misconduct in test-firing a &quot;live&quot; cartridge from the rifle defendant used to shoot the victim has been forfeited by his guilty plea. Although defendant phrases his argument in terms of a suppression issue, defendant was actually seeking the imposition of a sanction (i.e., dismissal of the indictment or preclusion of evidence regarding the &quot;live&quot; bullet) based upon the alleged improper destruction of the bullet evidence by the police; accordingly, the hearing court's denial of defendant's application is not reviewable pursuant to CPL 710.70 (2), inasmuch as that provision applies only to CPL article 710 motions to suppress.  Rather, the hearing court's rejection of defendant's claim amounted to an evidentiary ruling, review of which was forfeited by reason of the guilty plea. Moreover, the People's failure to argue on appeal that the issue was forfeited by defendant's guilty plea does not preclude the Appellate Division from making that determination, since a forfeiture may be enforced by a reviewing court regardless of the prosecution's position on the issue.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Disclosure - Destruction of Evidence by Police </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. In a homicide prosecution arising out of the purportedly accidental shooting of the victim by defendant, there was no improvident exercise of discretion in the hearing court's refusal to grant defendant's request to either dismiss the indictment or preclude the prosecution from introducing evidence regarding a &quot;live&quot; bullet, where the police test-fired the &quot;live&quot; cartridge from the rifle defendant used to shoot the victim, since the drastic sanctions sought by defendant were inappropriate.  Defense counsel was placed on notice of the existence of the bullet prior to its test firing, and firearms and ammunition used in the commission of crimes are routinely test-fired as a matter of standard police procedure, thus negating any possible suggestion that the bullet was destroyed in an effort to deprive the defense of evidence.  Moreover, defendant's failure to show that he suffered any prejudice as a result of the test-firing supports the denial of sanctions.  Defendant's elaborate and tenuous claims of prejudice advanced on appeal are irrelevant since they were not presented to the hearing court. Accordingly, the hearing court properly rejected defendant's request for sanctions and ruled that defendant would be free to fully explore the issue at trial.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Plea of Guilty - Forfeiture of Right to Raise Issues on Appeal - Defects in Indictment </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. In a homicide prosecution in which defendant negotiated a guilty plea to second degree manslaughter, defendant's claims attacking the adequacy of the indictment are nonjurisdictional and, thus, were forfeited by his plea. Moreover, defendant's contention that the indictment was jurisdictionally defective because it failed to state each and every element of the crime charged lacks merit.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, operators of a transfer station, sought review of a judgment from the Rockland County Supreme Court (New York), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee town in an action brought by the town to enjoin the operators from unlawfully disposing solid waste in violation of a local law and denied the operator's claim that the local law was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operators maintained an interstate transfer station in the town that was permitted as a recycling center. The town began operating its own transfer station and adopted a local law that made it unlawful to dispose of solid waste at a site other than the town operated facility. The operators were observed shipping solid waste from the recycling center and the town filed an action to enjoin the shipment of solid waste from the operator's facility. The supreme court found that the operators were in violation of the town's law and granted summary judgment in favor of the town. The operators claimed on appeal that the town's law violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, and that the town's law constituted a taking of property in violation of the Due Process Clauses of the United States and New York Constitutions, U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV, N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 6-7. The court rejected the operator's claims. The court found that the town's law applied evenhandedly to all solid waste processed within the town, regardless or the point of origin and that the operator's had not overcome the presumption that the town's laws were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the supreme court's injunction against the operator from violating the town's prohibition against operation of a transfer station at a site other than the town operated facility.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Regulation of Solid Waste Disposal - Financial Motivation in Enacting Local Law </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A local law which mandates that all solid waste processed or otherwise handled within a locality be processed at a designated facility constitutes a valid exercise of the locality's police power, and appellants' claim that the enactment of the local law was financially motivated and thus beyond the scope of its police power, lacks merit.  The regulation of solid waste collection and disposal, a function traditionally entrusted to State and local governments, is fundamentally related to the public health and welfare </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see, e.g.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Town Law &sect; 130 [6]; &sect; 136 [8]; &sect; 198 [9]; &sect; 221; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see also,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2 [c] [ii] [10]), and a concern for the continued economic viability of a solid waste management facility established pursuant to a plan to deal with the problem of solid waste disposal does not negate or detract from, but is a part of, the health, safety and environmental concerns such plan is designed to address.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Commerce Clause - Municipal Regulation of Solid Waste Disposal </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A local law which mandates that all solid waste processed or otherwise handled within a locality be processed at a designated facility constitutes a valid exercise of the locality's police power and does not constitute an unreasonable, discriminatory burden on interstate commerce. Although garbage is an article of commerce within the meaning of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, the Commerce Clause protects the interstate market, not particular interstate firms, such as those run by appellants, who are challenging the local law, which imposes no special fees, taxes, prohibitions or duties on those transporting out-of- State articles of commerce.  Rather, the local law applies evenhandedly to all solid waste processed within the locality, regardless of point of origin. Moreover, if the current $ 11 difference between the locality's tipping fee and the fee charged by appellants has any effect on the interstate flow of solid waste, there is no evidence to suggest that what can have nothing more than an incidental effect on interstate commerce is impermissibly burdensome, particularly when the &quot;burden&quot; is weighed against the legitimate and significant public concerns underlying the local law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Due Process of Law - Taking of Property - Municipal Regulation of Solid Waste Disposal </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A local law which mandates that all solid waste processed or otherwise handled within a locality be processed at a designated facility constitutes a valid exercise of the locality's police power and does not constitute an unlawful taking of property in violation of appellants' due process rights. Although appellants, who are challenging the law and who are in the waste disposal business, have alleged that the law will impair their business, they may still operate a recycling facility at their site within the locality, and there is no claim that the law in question deprives them of all economically viable uses of their site. While appellants may have had some vested interest in their permit to operate a solid waste transfer station, the expiration of that permit renders moot any claim that the local law retrospectively diminished or retroactively invalidated vested rights.  In light of the close relation of the law to the promotion of the public health, safety and welfare, the acute public interest in the proper management of solid waste, appellants' obvious knowledge that their business was and would be increasingly heavily regulated, and appellants' heavy burden of overcoming the presumption of constitutionality attaching to the law, there are no issues of fact warranting trial of appellants' due process claims.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Standing - Challenge to Local Law Regulating Disposal of Solid Waste </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Appellants, the owners and operators of a solid waste disposal business have no standing to challenge the adequacy of the environmental review pertaining to a locality's handling of the solid waste disposal problem within its borders.  Although appellants' economic concerns do not deprive them of standing to also complain of environmental injury, they are aggrieved only economically by the enactment of a local law which mandates that all solid waste processed or otherwise handled within the locality be processed at a designated facility.  Neither that economic injury nor appellants' status as property owners within the locality is sufficient to confer standing to challenge the locality's failure to separately issue environmental declarations with respect to that part of the locality's remedial plan requiring all solid waste processed within the locality to be processed at the locality's transfer station. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Authorities - Solid Waste Management Authority - Withdrawal of Member Municipality </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A town may not unilaterally withdraw its membership in a public authority created by the Legislature for the purpose of dealing with the management of solid waste where the town voluntarily joined the authority, where the enabling legislation provided that unless six municipalities joined the authority by a certain date, the authority's corporate existence would terminate, and where said legislation provided that once defendant included six members it would be perpetual in duration </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Public Authorities Law &sect; 2050-bb [18]; &sect; 2050-cc [4]), but provided no means whereby a municipality could withdraw from the authority, since the absence of withdrawal language was an intended omission based upon prior precedent and the fact that the Legislature alone has the power to create, modify and dissolve public corporations </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art X, &sect; 5).  The absence of withdrawal language was not an oversight, and a municipality may withdraw from the authority only through an act of the Legislature.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Home Rule Powers - Withdrawal of Municipality from Regional Solid Waste Management Authority </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A town may not unilaterally withdraw its membership in a public authority created by the Legislature for the purpose of dealing with the management of solid waste where the town voluntarily joined the authority and where the enabling legislation provided no means for effecting a withdrawal. The enabling legislation (Public Authorities Law, art 8, tit 13-H) is constitutional and does not interfere with plaintiff town's rights under Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 10 and NY Constitution, article IX, &sect; 2 (c) (ii) (10).  There is no unconstitutional limitation of the authority's powers because the creation of public authorities and their powers is wholly within the Legislature's purview, and plaintiff's powers to adopt laws benefitting its citizens do not extend that far.  The State has clearly preempted the field as it relates to public authorities, and, therefore, plaintiff town's resolution attempting to unilaterally change its membership status in the authority is inconsistent with the State's transcendent interest, regardless of whether the terms of the resolution actually conflict with Public Authorities Law &sect; 2050-cc (4).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In their actions to restrain respondents, villages located within appellant town, from delivering or disposing of solid waste in violation of the town's law and the town-village contracts, appellants, town and solid waste management authority (authority), challenged the decisions of the Supreme Court, Nassau County, New York, which, inter alia, denied their motions for summary judgment and granted the villages partial summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed in part and affirmed in part. It held that the lower court erred in denying appellants' summary judgment motions. The court declared that the villages failed to carry their burden of showing that 1983 N.Y. Laws ch. 544 (effective July 20, 1983), regulating the disposal of solid waste, violated the Home Rule provisions N.Y. Const. art. IX. Nor was the statute unconstitutional because it provided a funding mechanism for financing the construction of resource recovery facilities. The court held that the town's flow control law, North Hempstead, N.Y., Code ch. 46, was valid because 1983 N.Y. Laws ch. 544 and N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law tit. 13-F, N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 2049-a et seq., enabled the town to make and adopt a local law which would be applicable in the incorporated villages with respect to solid waste disposal. In addition, the court found that under the agreements between the villages and the town, the villages expressly agreed to comply with the town's flow control law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Home Rule Powers - Town Solid Waste Management Authority - State Interest in Waste Disposal - Alleged Mismanagement of Public Trust </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Laws of 1983 (ch 544), which authorized the Town of North Hempstead to adopt a local law providing for the management on a town-wide basis of all solid waste generated within the town, is constitutional and valid.  The several incorporated villages which have challenged the statute have failed to carry their burden of demonstrating that the State had no interest in the subject matter of the law; rather, the villages alleged that the town has mismanaged the trust imposed upon it by the statute, but the subject of mismanagement is nonjusticiable and does not provide a basis for declaring a duly enacted statute unconstitutional. Moreover, it is clear that the State has an interest in solid waste management, and although the villages were traditionally responsible for their own solid waste disposal, the stated purpose of the statute shows that it is also a matter of State concern.  If the subject of legislation is in substantial degree a matter of State concern, the Legislature may act, though intermingled with it are concerns of the locality.  Accordingly, the subject law does not violate the Home Rule provisions of article IX of the State Constitution.  Nor is the statute unconstitutional because it provides a funding mechanism for financing the construction of resource recovery facilities.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Home Rule Powers - Town Solid Waste Management Authority - Local Law - Objections of Villages </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A town law, which established a town solid waste management authority and required all solid waste generated within the town to be delivered to the authority, was validly enacted pursuant to Laws of 1983 (ch 544), which authorized the town to provide for the management of solid waste and explicitly permitted the town to &quot;displace competition with regulation or monopoly public service&quot;.  Said town law is valid and not in conflict with Town Law &sect; 132, which renders town laws inoperative within villages unless &quot;specifically provided by statute&quot;, since Laws of 1983 (ch 544) specifically provides that solid waste shall be handled on a &quot;Town-wide basis&quot;, and the phrase &quot;Town-wide basis&quot; must be intended to encompass the incorporated villages within the town.  To achieve the statutory goal of &quot;maximum resource recovery&quot;, a solid waste management facility must be assured a steady stream of waste, and Public Authorities Law &sect; 2049-u empowers the town to adopt any local law requiring the delivery of such waste to its facility.  Moreover, assuming the relevant statutes are ambiguous, their purpose, i.e., to eliminate competition and provide a comprehensive framework for solid waste management, requires a construction which would further that end.  Furthermore, the villages challenging the validity of the town law expressly agreed to comply with it when they executed contracts clearly calling for the delivery of waste to the town's facility.  </SPAN></P>

The court found that the truck haulers failed to meet their heavy burden of demonstrating that the subject regulations were not reasonably related to those purposes or that the regulations discriminated against interstate commerce. Thus, under the circumstances, the regulations did not violate the truck haulers' constitutional due process rights, nor did they impose an undue burden on interstate commerce. The court further found that the establishment of a cut-off date for the issuance of permits or the &quot;grandfathering&quot; of certain vehicles registered prior to that cut-off date did not constitute an invalid classification where, as here, the legislation and regulatory scheme were rationally related to the achievement of the governmental purpose of reducing the overall weight of vehicles traveling on state highways.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts - Jurisdiction - Approval of Settlement of Lawsuit between Town and Corporation </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Supreme Court has subject matter jurisdiction to either approve or disapprove a proposed settlement of a declaratory judgment action between plaintiff corporation, which operated a landfill, and defendant Town, where plaintiff sought relief from various restrictive provisions of a local law adopted by the Town which regulated plaintiff's landfill, since the clear and unequivocal language of Town Law &sect; 68 (1) (a) requires a Town Board to obtain judicial approval of a compromise or settlement of any &quot;action or proceeding&quot; against a Town, and the &quot;small claims exception&quot; of Town Law &sect; 68 (4) is not applicable to oust the court of jurisdiction to approve a proposed settlement of a declaratory judgment action. While a municipality possesses the inherent right to compromise a claim against it, it may not, under the guise of a compromise, impair a public duty owed by it or give validity to a void claim.  Accordingly, the courts act as checks against possible fraud, and nothing in the plain language of the statute, its legislative history or case law limits the judicial approval requirement to actions seeking money damages only.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Home Rule Powers - Judicial Approval of Settlement of Lawsuit between Town and Corporation </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Supreme Court properly refused to approve a settlement of a declaratory judgment action between plaintiff corporation, which operates a landfill, and defendant Town, where plaintiff sought relief from various restrictive provisions of a Town law which regulated plaintiff's landfill, where the court expressly recognized that it was not to sit in review of the legislative actions of the Town Board, yet refused to &quot;rubber-stamp&quot; the proposed settlement. Rather, the court properly viewed its role as one of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">parens patriae,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> similar to its obligation in considering the proposed settlement of an action involving an infant, etc.  The court did not consider the proposed settlement in terms of its financial impact on the Town, but rather considered whether the proposed settlement properly protected nonfinancial interests such as the legitimate environmental concerns of the Town's residents. Moreover, in noting that the compromise was approved by a simple majority of the Town Board, the court expressed its concern that the Board was using its authority to settle actions as a vehicle to circumvent the supermajority requirement of the local law in question.  </SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. &sect; 7803(2), seeking a judgment prohibiting respondent county comptroller from recouping moneys from her paychecks. The employee also sought a declaration that such action was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court of Suffolk County (New York) granted the employee relief in the nature of a prohibition and converted the declaratory request to a plenary action. The county comptroller appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was a clerk for the county. Based on reports that the employee was frequently absent from work, the comptroller conducted an audit of the employee's work attendance and sent copies of the audit to the employee and to the county legislators as required by the Suffolk Co., N.Y., Charter art. V. The audit report found that the employee had been absent without authorization and that she had received an overpayment in unearned wages. When the employee refused to sign a confession of judgment as to the overpayment, the comptroller began withholding 10 percent of her salary in every paycheck. The court held that the comptroller possessed the inherent common-law authority to formulate and implement a plan of recoupment as a function of his constitutional and statutory duties. As such, the court held that there was no basis for concluding that wages or salaries were immune from a plan of recoupment which otherwise complied with statutory mandates. The court also held that due process did not require the comptroller to commence a plenary action or to await a judicial determination before exercising his authority.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counties - Comptroller - Power to Recoup Salary Overpayment from Wages of County Employee </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent County Comptroller possesses the inherent authority, pursuant to his express duties as the chief fiscal officer of the County and his common-law power and duty to recoup public moneys, to recoup alleged salary overpayments from the wages of a County employee, and due process did not require him to commence a plenary action or to await a judicial determination before exercising his authority.  The authority to recoup grows out of the recognized principle that public moneys which are erroneously or mistakenly paid out must be recoverable.  The Comptroller has the statutory duty to &quot;certify the correctness of payrolls for the payment of salaries of officers and employees paid from county funds&quot; (County Law &sect; 577 [1] [i]), and the County Charter requires that the Comptroller must examine, audit and verify all books, records and accounts paid from County funds, and audit and approve payrolls and determine their regularity.  The provisions of the County Charter fail to support the assertion that the Comptroller failed to comply with its procedural requirements.  Finally, while petitioner claims that the existence of a factual dispute regarding the amount of money owed precludes the Comptroller from implementing the plan of recoupment, she was afforded the opportunity to submit evidence of her work attendance to the Comptroller and she in fact attended conferences with and submitted documentation to him in an attempt to resolve the matter prior to the issuance of the disputed audit, and she expressly limited her remedies to relief in the nature of prohibition. </SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed judgment. The court stated that the purchaser had failed to establish that he was the owner of the car prior to the alteration of the VIN or that he had purchased the car from the one who owned the vehicle before such alteration. The court stated that the department was entitled to hold the car, pursuant to &sect; 423-a. The court stated that the purchaser did not offer sufficient evidence to rebut as a matter of law the statutory presumption that the car was a stolen vehicle.</SPAN></P>

The business owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business owner asserted that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague, that it violated his right to eat and consume beverages in public without restriction, and that his right to carry on a lawful business was unlawfully infringed. The supreme court dismissed the complaint for lack of standing to sue and for failure to state a cause of action. The court affirmed and held that the complaint failed to set forth a justiciable controversy and did not establish the business owner's standing. The business owner's attempt to predicate standing on an unspecified right to eat and drink in public without restriction failed because no such protected interest existed. The alleged injury to the business owner's business, a restaurant, was too remote and incidental in nature to establish standing to demand a judgment declaring the ordinance invalid. The business owner's allegations of harm to his business interests was simply an attempt to predicate standing upon the nonexistent right of the public at large to eat and drink in public places without restriction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed order granting plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and declaring N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 3387 (3)&nbsp;unconstitutional. Law provided for the seizure and forfeiture of any equipment intended for use in administering a controlled substance. Plaintiffs were retail stores that sold glass pipes suitable for freebasing crack cocaine. First, court stated that burden on plaintiffs to establish that statute was unconstitutional was high, especially when it was a civil forfeiture provision and not a penal statute. Court found that statute was rationally related to legislative objective of banning sale of drug paraphernalia. Next, court held that phrase &quot;intended for use&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague because it provided sufficient notice to pass constitutional muster. Court found that an ordinary person would be put on notice by the statute that the displaying of crack pipes in his establishment would subject these items to seizure by the police, and the lack of a legitimate use for crack pipes obviated any question concerning the arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement of the statute. Finding the statute to be constitutional, court reversed order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An omnibus revenue measure (act) was enacted that was designed to balance the state fiscal year 1990-1991 budget and that provided for a $ 1.2 billion increase in tax revenues and a $ 489 million increase in one-time revenue resources. The taxpayers commenced the combined proceeding challenging various sections of the act as invalid under the state constitution. Specifically, the taxpayers contended that certain provisions of the act authorizing the issuance of bonds, notes and other obligations for various projects violated N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect;&sect; 11, 8, and 5. The state's motion to dismiss the petition/complaint based on laches and lack of standing was denied except that the trial court concluded that the taxpayers lacked standing with respect to those portions of the petition challenging the authorization, sale, execution or delivery of bond issues. On appeal, the court held that the taxpayers lack taxpayer standing with respect to those portions of the complaint/petition challenging sections of the act that also dealt with the extension of state credit and long-term debt without voter approval.

The motion court denied summary judgment because there were issues of fact about the liquidated damages clause and allegations concerning the principals' minority status. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that plaintiff's challenge to the MBE program arose solely in response to allegations that the contracts plaintiff sought to enforce were awarded based upon plaintiff's misrepresentation of MBE compliance. The court held that plaintiff's challenge to the program after 10 years of participation and $ 46 million in payments to plaintiff was untenable, because the court found a voluntary, knowing and intelligent waiver of constitutional rights based upon plaintiff's participation.</SPAN></P>

Although the parties cross-appealed concerning a subpoena served upon the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), the court mooted that issue by granting the State's motion for summary judgment. The court held that: (1) the towns' summary judgment proof failed to rebut the strong presumption of constitutionality that attended &sect; 27-0704; (2) the towns' statutory duty to close their landfills was independent of the DEC's charge to issue a solid waste management policy for Long Island; (3) the towns' summary judgment evidence raised no issues of fact as to whether the Commissioner changed one town's hydrologic zone boundaries; and (4) even if the towns' summary judgment proof did raise a fact issue on that question, the State was still entitled to summary judgment because, under the statute, the Commissioner had authority to change hydrologic zone boundaries.</SPAN></P>

The comptroller brought an action against defendants, seeking a declaration that &sect; 381 was unconstitutional. Defendants brought a motion to dismiss on the ground that the comptroller lacked standing, that the controversy was not justiciable, and that the comptroller failed to obtain approval of the action from the state attorney general as required under N.Y.

The court affirmed, holding that the comptroller, who had the duty to oversee the state's fiscal concerns, had an actual legal stake in the matter. The action was justiciable because declaratory judgment actions were commonly used to determine the rights of parties upon the happening of a future event.

The court held that the lienholder was not entitled to the right to replevin of the vehicle to satisfy its perfected security interest. The property clerk was permitted to sell the vehicle at auction and retain a portion of the proceeds for administrative expenses. The remainder would be remitted to the lienholder. The court found that the lienholder was not entitled to possession of the vehicle even though the proceeds from the sale would not satisfy the lien, and the lienholder had done all that it reasonably could to prevent the illegal use of the vehicle. As a lienholder, it had no greater right to possession of the vehicle than the owner who had forfeited such right.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the city's argument that by proceeding before the finance department, the taxpayer elected its remedy was simply erroneous.

The court indicated that even when a taxpayer has received an administrative determination, it may nevertheless attack the constitutionality of a statute in a plenary action. However, the court found that the taxpayer's motion for preliminary injunctive relief presented insufficient evidence to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits and made only a conclusory allegation that it would be irreparably injured if injunctive relief was not provided.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, magazine and publisher, appealed the judgment of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which awarded plaintiff model compensatory and punitive damages in a bench trial on her sexual harassment claim under &sect;&sect; 296(1), 297(9) of the New York Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 290 et seq., and denied defendants' motion to vacate the punitive damages award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff model brought suit against defendants, magazine and publisher, alleging sexual harassment in violation of &sect;&sect; 296(1), 297(9) of the New York Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 290 et seq. Following a bench trial, the court awarded plaintiff $ 60,000 in compensatory and $ 4,000,000 in punitive damages. On appeal, the court vacated the punitive damages award but affirmed the compensatory damages award, holding that punitive damages were not available under &sect; 297(9) because by including in the Human Rights Law a provision for the award of punitive damages in cases of housing discrimination only, the state legislature had indicated an intent to exclude punitive damages in all other instances. The court further held that the legislature intended to provide an alternative judicial forum for the determination of claims arising under the Human Rights Law, not to afford relief different in kind and greater in degree from that available in administrative proceedings before the State Division of Human Rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the award of punitive damages against defendants, magazine and publisher, but otherwise modified and affirmed the judgment in favor of plaintiff model. The New York Human Rights Law did not contemplate punitive damages because the statutory language and legislative history suggested only that the legislature intended to provide an alternative, judicial forum for the determination of claims arising under the Human Rights Law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that there was no merit to the cafe owner's argument that the padlocking order was in excess of its jurisdiction and arbitrary and capricious.

The evidence supported the finding that the premises were being used primarily for several activities, none of which under the statute was required to predominate. The court held that there was no merit to the cafe owner's argument that the statute, both on its face and as applied to the facts of this case, was unconstitutionally vague because it did not define &quot;dancing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner was a corporation whose president resided on the property that the tax deed holder purchased at a tax sale. The court found it was unnecessary to address the tax deed holder's argument that service of the notice of the tax sale by publication only was constitutional because there was evidence that the property owner and occupant received actual notice of the sale. Respondent auditor testified that actual notice of the tax sale was mailed to the owner. The court held that certified mail receipts bore the owner's president's signature and showed that the owner had actual notice of the expiration of the period of redemption. The court held that notice on the owner's president constituted notice on the corporation because there was compliance with N.Y. C.P.L.R. 311 and N.Y. C.P.L.R. 308. The court held that the matter was not barred by the statute of limitations because the presumption of regularity of notice given to the property owner was not be conclusive until after six years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, New York City Transit Authority (transit authority), sought review of a decision of the Supreme Court, New York County, which denied its motion to set aside the jury verdict finding that an officer of the transit authority used excessive force against plaintiff robber.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer of the transit authority shot a robber in the back leaving him paralyzed. The robber filed an action against the transit authority alleging excessive force and seeking damages. A jury in the lower court found that excessive force was used and awarded damages. The transit authority filed a motion to set aside the verdict based on an improper jury charge. The lower court denied the motion and the court on appeal affirmed the denial. The court held that the errors claimed by the transit authority were either nonexistent or insignificant and unpreserved. The court held that a reversal would require a rejection of the jury's fact finding and a replacement with the court's own or would penalize the wrong party for unpreserved error. The court held that either result would be an abuse of the court's authority on review. The court held that an objection to a charge must state the matter to which the objection was being made and the grounds for such objection. A general objection was not sufficient. Therefore, the transit authority's &quot;respectfully except, your Honor&quot; was inadequate to preserve for review its disagreement with the jury instructions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action to recover for personal injuries sustained by plaintiff when, in the course of the mugging of an elderly man, he was shot by a police officer employed by defendant, defendant's appellate contentions have either not been preserved or do not constitute reversible error, and, accordingly, a judgment in favor of plaintiff is affirmed.  Defendant urges that the action should have been dismissed pursuant to Penal Law &sect; 35.30 and the decision of the United States Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Tennessee v Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (471 US 1), or alternatively, that the holding in that case is not germane to the instant situation and, in any event, should not have been retroactively applied to this matter; however, since defense counsel not only did not object to reliance upon </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Tennessee v Garner (supra),</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wherein it was held that where an officer has probable cause to believe that a felony suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to prevent escape by using deadly force, but acknowledged that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was both controlling and retroactively applicable, defendant may not for the first time before the Appellate Division endeavor to disclaim the relevance and applicability of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (CPLR 5501 [a] [3]).  Similarly, defendant failed to advise the trial court that it deemed it improper to charge the jury pursuant to the standard of reasonableness of an officer's conduct as enunciated in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Tennessee v Garner (supra),</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and defendant may not now advance such an argument on appeal (CPLR 4110-b).  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action to recover for personal injuries sustained by plaintiff when, in the course of the mugging of an elderly man, he was shot by a police officer employed by defendant, a judgment in favor of plaintiff is affirmed.  Defendant's assertion of qualified immunity is precluded as not having been preserved and on the merits is without substance inasmuch as defendant could be liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In an action against defendant Transit Authority to recover for injuries sustained by plaintiff after he was shot by a police officer employed by defendant when the officer intervened during the course of an assault perpetrated by plaintiff and others, defendant's contention that the trial court improperly permitted the jury to consider defendant's 1982 and 1986 rules and regulations lacks merit.  Defendant never objected to the admission of the 1982 regulations, and in any event, the regulations did not impose a higher standard of care than Penal Law &sect; 35.30.  As for the 1986 regulations, the court struck from the record all reference to those rules and regulations after plaintiff agreed to withdraw them from evidence, and the court gave adequate curative instructions to the jury.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the proof at the hearing established that the subcontractor's work involved solely the installation of a telecommunications system. The commissioner could properly have concluded that, despite respondent Department of Labor's inability to determine the specific job duties of each worker of the subcontractor, all the workers were entitled to receive, at a minimum, the wage rate for telephone installer, rather than that for electrician-lineman. The university's request for proposal specified the work in sufficient detail to constitute compliance with N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 220(3-a)(a). The department's investigation, prompted by a letter from an unsuccessful bidder, was not unlawful under N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 220(7), which permitted the commissioner to cause a compliance investigation to be made on his own initiative. The department's adoption of the wage rates set forth in the local collective bargaining agreement did not represent an unconstitutional delegation of power. Because the subcontractor continued to adhere to its payment practices after being notified that they were violative of N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 220, the finding of willfulness would not be disturbed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the commissioner determination that, inter alia, the subcontractor willfully failed to pay prevailing wages and supplements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff federal savings and loan association challenged the grant by the Supreme Court, Nassau County (New York) of summary judgment for defendant New York State. The association argued that a state statute, which imposed a recording tax on mortgages but prohibited lenders from passing the cost on to borrowers, was preempted by a federal regulation permitting federal savings and loan associations to pass loan costs on to borrowers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The federal savings and loan association challenged the validity of the state's N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 253(1-a)(a). The statute imposed a recording tax on certain mortgages and prohibited the lender from passing the cost on to the borrower. The association alleged that the statute was preempted by a Federal Home Loan Bank Board (board) regulation permitting federal savings and loan associations to pass on to their borrowers the necessary costs incurred in connection with making the loans. The trial court granted the state summary judgment. On appeal, the court noted that the board's regulatory scheme over federal savings and loan associations preempted any conflicting state law. The state did not challenge the board's authority to preempt its law, but argued that the regulation covered only services rendered by private parties in connection with loan processing and thus did not apply to the recording tax. The court disagreed, noting that the regulation included other necessary incidental services and costs. 12 C.F.R. &sect; 545.32(b)(5). The statute was therefore preempted by the regulation, and the court enjoined its application to the federal savings and loan association.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed summary judgment for the state and entered a judgment for the federal savings and loan association enjoining application of the state's statute to the federal savings and loan association because it was preempted by the federal regulation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tax Law &sect; 253 (1-a) (a) conflicts with 12 CFR 545.32 (b) (5), which was promulgated by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and permits Federal savings and loan associations to pass through to their borrowers the necessary costs incurred in connection with making loans secured by mortgages on real property, by imposing a recording tax on mortgages securing loans for certain properties while prohibiting the lender from passing on this cost to the borrower. Although the State has the power to levy a mortgage recording tax, it cannot, under the guise of this authority, or in the exercise of its police powers, interfere with the lending practices of Federally chartered savings and loan associations, or prevent such lenders from recouping the costs of making loans by passing through the cost of the tax to their borrowers. Accordingly, Tax Law &sect; 253 (1-a) (a), insofar as it imposes a mortgage recording tax which may not be passed on to the borrower, is preempted by Federal regulation and is unenforceable as against Federal savings and loan associations.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers brought suit against defendant officials, arguing that under a recent United States Supreme Court decision construing 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 111, the state's taxation of pension benefits of federal retirees was illegal. The Supreme Court in Queens County (New York) granted declaratory and injunctive relief to the taxpayers, but denied them class action status and dismissed their 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first held that the standards set by the Supreme Court for determining whether a decision should be given retrospective application had not been overruled by a later case and thus were still viable. Applying those standards, it held that the tax case in question should be applied prospectively, stating that it established a new principle of law by deciding an issue of first impression the resolution of which was not clearly foreshadowed; that retroactive application would neither retard nor further the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity; and that the equities surrounding retroactive application preponderated in the state's favor. Thus, it held, the trial court's order awarding refunds and similar relief to the taxpayers should be reversed. It held that the trial court correctly denied the taxpayers' application for class action status, stating that class certification was inappropriate in a case where governmental actions were involved and subsequent plaintiffs would be adequately protected under the doctrine of stare decisis. It upheld the dismissal of the &sect; 1983 claims, stating that qualified immunity provided a basis on which to reject them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the trial court's order to delete the provisions that prevented the officials from assessing and collecting taxes on the taxpayers' federal pension benefits received from 1986 to 1988 and that awarded the taxpayers refunds for the taxes paid on those benefits from 1986 to 1988.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A decision holding unconstitutional and invalid former Tax Law &sect; 612 (c) (3) and former Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 11-1712 (c) (3), which subjected Federal, but not State or municipal, pension benefits to income tax, should be applied prospectively only, where a curative amendment stated that it would take effect &quot;immediately&quot; and apply to all Federal pension benefits received after a certain date.  The decision in question was derived from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Davis v Michigan Dept. of Treasury</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (489 U.S. 803) which established a new principle of law, whose resolution of an &quot;esoteric&quot; problem was not clearly foreshadowed, and there has been no showing that retroactive application of the decision will either retard or further the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity in light of the fact that the primary purpose of that doctrine is to protect the Federal Government, not private individuals, from being unduly burdened by State taxation. The equities preponderate in the State's favor given the fact that the old taxing scheme had been in force for 50 years, that a sizeable refund of taxes paid would be inappropriate in the current fiscal climate, and that neither party could have reasonably anticipated the invalidation of the long-standing tax provision.  Accordingly, it was improper to have ordered tax refunds to plaintiffs, recipients of Federal pension benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Actions -- Class Actions -- Denial of Class Status in Action against Government</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action to invalidate a provision of the State and New York City income tax, denial of class action status was proper since class action certification is inappropriate where governmental actions are involved and subsequent plaintiffs will be adequately protected under the doctrine of stare decisis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In an action to invalidate tax statutes which discriminated against recipients of Federal, as opposed to State and municipal, pension benefits for income tax purposes, rejection of plaintiffs' claims under 42 USC &sect; 1983 was correct.  The defense of qualified immunity was available to defendants inasmuch as the right claimed by plaintiffs, recipients of Federal pension benefits, under 4 USC &sect; 111 was not clearly established until a relatively recent opinion of the United States Supreme Court was handed down </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Davis v Michigan Dept. of Treasury,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 489 U.S. 803), thereby shielding the individual defendants from liability for civil damages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Money Received -- Claim against Government -- Protest Requirement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In an action to invalidate tax statutes which discriminated against recipients of Federal, as opposed to State and municipal, pension benefits for income tax purposes, plaintiffs' claim for money had and received was properly disallowed since an appropriate legal protest prior to or at the time of payment is a prerequisite to recovery in an action seeking refunds, and the protest requirement was not satisfied by plaintiffs.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The biological father brought an action to vacate or set aside the adoption of his child on the ground that he was not aware of the mother's pregnancy until 17 months after the child's birth and 10 months after the child's adoption was finalized. The father argued that his constitutional rights were violated because he had no notice of the child's birth nor of an opportunity to assert paternity or manifest an interest in parenting the child. The trial court dismissed his petition. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that neither the U.S. Constitution nor N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 111-a(2) required that the biological father be given notice of the adoption. Further, the court found that the state had the authority to deny a right of consent to the adoption to the unwed, biological father because he had not come forward to immediately assume a parenting role. Finally, the court found that to allow a biological father to contest an adoption after its finalization on grounds that he was previously unaware of the pregnancy would undermine the state's interest in facilitating speedy adoptions and providing stable homes for adopted children.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner, the alleged biological father of a child born out of wedlock, who was not aware of the mother's pregnancy until 17 months after the birth of the child and until 10 months after an adoption of the child was finalized, was not unconstitutionally deprived of due process when he was not notified of the adoption proceeding, or given the opportunity to oppose the adoption.  The State can deny a right of consent to unwed fathers who do not come forward to immediately assume their parental responsibilities and can prescribe conditions for determining whether the unwed father's manifestation of interest in his child is sufficiently prompt and substantial to require full constitutional protection. There is no merit to petitioner's claim that he was deprived of his constitutional rights; he never developed a custodial relationship with the child and cannot now pursue his parental interest at this late stage.  Further, no fraudulent concealment occurred; there is no evidence of any act on the mother's part after petitioner moved from her home, to conceal the pregnancy or the birth of the child, and she was not required to disclose the identity of the biological father during the adoption proceeding. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner of an apartment complex in Manhattan proposed to demolish five buildings with 401 apartments in order to construct high-rise luxury apartments. Most of the buildings contained rent-controlled apartments. The Sound Housing Act, N.Y. Admin. Code &sect; 26-408(b)(5), required the owner first to prove there was no reasonable possibility it could earn an 8 1/2 percent annual return on the assessed value of the property without demolition and development. The owner filed suit for declaratory judgment against the state of New York, seeking, among other things, to declare the Act unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the complaint upon the motion of the state of New York and the tenants' association. On appeal, the court held that the unlawful administration by state officers of a statute fair on its face was not a denial of equal protection unless there was shown to be intentional or purposeful discrimination. Second, the Sound Housing Act was reasonably related to the state's legitimate interests in preventing unreasonable rent increases in scarce housing. Finally, the 8 1/2 percent return on assessment standard in the Act did not violate the Taking Clause.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, even if the property were arbitrarily assessed to the extent of violating the Equal Protection Clause, the remedy would not be an action challenging the constitutionality of the Act, but one challenging the assessment process under the Real Property Tax Law.</SPAN></P>

A constitutional violation will not result merely because a landowner is deprived of the most profitable use of his property as long as some beneficial alternative use exists, and there has been no showing that plaintiff has been denied the use of its property.  Moreover, rent control has been held not to be a per se taking; the Act advances a legitimate State interest; there is no taking where the owner's earnings are limited by a valuation of property below actual market value as long as the return is not unreasonable, and the Act does not single out a small group of property owners and require them to bear a disproportionate share of an existing problem.  </SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. 7804(f) on the ground that the proceeding was barred by the expiration of the four-month limitations period contained in N.Y. C.P.L.R. 217. The plans appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plans contended the lower court erred in dismissing their complaint which alleged ten causes of action challenging the superintendent's approval of a trust agreement providing for the distribution of excess trust fund moneys as time barred pursuant to the four-month limitations period contained in N.Y. C.P.L.R. 217. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Initially, it rejected the plans' first argument that the causes of were not barred by the expiration of the four-month limitations period because a continuing wrong was involved. In the court's view the superintendent's acts of approving and upholding the contested provision of the trust agreement were fully completed, separate, discrete acts which did not constitute a continuing wrong against the plans. The court also found no merit to the plans' claim that because the first, second, fourth, and eighth causes of action asserted constitutional violations relating to the taking of property without due process, substantive due process, separation of powers and equal protection, they should have been converted to declaratory judgment actions and were subject to a six-year statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

Although petitioner has asserted that the limitations period should begin to run from the date it requested that the Superintendent delete an objectionable provision of the agreement, the limitations period began to run at least four years earlier when the trust agreement became final and binding. The request to delete the objectionable provision did not revive the already expired limitations period. Moreover, contrary to petitioner's contentions, the Superintendent's acts of approving and upholding the challenged provision were fully completed, separate, discrete acts which did not constitute a continuing wrong against petitioner such as would prevent the petition from being dismissed on limitations grounds.</SPAN></P>

A petition challenging the approval by the Superintendent of Insurance of a trust agreement providing for the distribution of excess trust fund moneys related to medical malpractice insurance was properly dismissed as time barred where it was brought more than four months after the Superintendent issued his approval, and although petitioner has raised several constitutional claims concerning the taking of property without due process, substantive due process, separation of powers and equal protection, the raising of those issues does not justify converting the matter into a declaratory judgment action and applying a six-year Statute of Limitations, since the constitutional challenges relate to the Superintendent's approval of the agreement and are governed by the four-month limitations period (CPLR 217).  Accordingly, the constitutional claims are time barred.</SPAN></P>

In a proceeding challenging the approval by the Superintendent of Insurance of a trust agreement providing for the distribution of excess trust fund moneys relating to medical malpractice insurance, petitioner's claim that the Superintendent should be equitably estopped from raising the Statute of Limitations as a defense on the grounds that the Superintendent concealed petitioner's cause of action by not revealing the agreement in response to petitioner's freedom of information request is without merit since petitioner did not specifically request disclosure of the trust agreement in issue, and, therefore, the Superintendent did not have to disclose such document.  Accordingly, as there was no concealment of the cause of action in the manner alleged by petitioner, the doctrine of equitable estoppel is inapplicable.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1197 offered an incentive to counties to participate in a &quot;special traffic options program for driving while intoxicated&quot; program (STOP-DWI) by providing that all fines, penalties, and forfeitures imposed by the county courts in intoxicant-related offense prosecutions would be diverted from state revenues to the county where the offense was committed and deposited in a special account to fund the local program. However, the 1990-1991 State Operations Budget bill contained a provision directing the comptroller to collect and deposit to the general fund up to 2 percent of revenues received in any court pursuant to the STOP-DWI program. The court affirmed the order of the supreme court; the county plaintiffs had standing because they were asserting a proprietary claim of entitlement to a specific fund, i.e., their entitlement to receive the monies collected by the courts under the STOP-DWI legislation. The provision violated the constitutional constraint of N.Y. Const. art.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Counties -- Entitlement to STOP-DWI Funds -- Constitutional Duties of State Comptroller</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A provision in the 1990-1991 State Operations Budget directing the State Comptroller to retain up to 2% of the moneys collected pursuant to the &quot;special traffic options program for driving while intoxicated&quot; (STOP-DWI) and deposit them into the State's General Fund, rather than remit all of the funds to the counties participating in the STOP-DWI program, is invalid since the provision in question violates the constitutional constraint against assignment of administrative duties to the Comptroller not incidental to performance of his constitutional functions </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, NY Const, art V, &sect; 1).  The STOP-DWI legislation provides in unmistakable terms that the moneys collected by the courts of record in the participating counties as fines, etc., for prosecution of the covered offenses constitute county, and not State, receipts </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1197 [1] [a]), and do not ever come into the hands of the Comptroller </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1803 [9] [a]).  Accordingly, the duty of the Comptroller assigned by the challenged legislation is not analogous to his setting off an amount due the State incidental to auditing a claim for payment from State funds, nor is the legislation in question merely a direction for the internal allocation of funds within the State's financial structure.  There is no nexus at all between the statutorily imposed responsibility and any auditing or other constitutionally designated function of the Comptroller.  </SPAN></P>

Because this continuation of benefits clause affected post-expiration of contract rights, it was not in conflict with N.Y. Civ. Serv.

Nor was the continuation of benefits clause repealed or modified by the deferred payroll lag statute. The impairment of contract here was substantial and the deferred payroll statute was not justified as a legitimate means of alleviating the State's fiscal crisis. Further, a severance of the portions of the statute affecting unrepresented employees was not warranted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An individual taxpayer lacks standing to challenge the class ratio methodology employed by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment since such taxpayers lack standing to challenge the methodology used by the Board to calculate equalization rates, and challenges to class ratios, which are essentially equalization rates computed for a particular class of property in a given special assessing unit ( RPTL 1202 [1] [b]), should not be treated any differently.  The fact that class ratios are utilized mainly as evidence in tax certiorari proceedings does not compel the conclusion that they must therefore be more precise; while the Board must &quot;ascertain as near as may be the percentage of full value&quot; in determining equalization rates </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;RPTL 1202 [1] [a]), there is no such requirement with respect to class ratios.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An individual taxpayer lacks standing to challenge the class ratio methodology employed by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment, and it is not true that taxpayers situated in special assessing units are disadvantaged in that they have no reasonably effective means available of proving inequality vis-a-vis ratio because the alternative, the stratified random sample method, is economically unfeasible. The random sample need only be drawn from within the major type of property in which the assessment under review is classified </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;RPTL 720 [3] [b] [1]), and, thus, the taxpayer need not consider the entire roll in proving inequality. Moreover, since the stratified random sample method affords a taxpayer in a special assessing unit a reasonable alternative to the class ratio for proving ratio, barring the taxpayer from challenging the class ratio methodology for lack of standing does not violate his right to due process.  The right to be heard does not include an opportunity to judicially contest the merits of every legislative determination in the taxing statute.  </SPAN></P>

When the officer told the minor that he was concerned about the bulge under her coat, the minor unzipped her coat and handed him a plastic bag that contained cocaine. The minor claimed that the encounter with the officer was tantamount to a seizure because she was confined in the bus. The court rejected the minor's claims. The court found that the officer's observation of the minor's nervous behavior and the bulge in her midsection provided and objective, credible reason to make an informational inquiry, that there was no detention of the minor or hint of harassment or intimidation, and that the minor's decision to hand over the bag of cocaine was not the result of coercion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the family court's order, which adjudicated the minor to be a juvenile delinquent after finding that the minor had committed acts, which if committed by an adult, would have constituted the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a juvenile delinquency proceeding arising out of appellant's handing over to a police officer a quantity of cocaine after being questioned on a bus, the officer's inquiry of appellant was appropriate in view of the purpose sought to be achieved by Family Court Act &sect; 718 and entirely justifiable where the youthful-looking 14-year-old appellant had been observed waiting nervously to board the bus and had a grapefruit-sized bulge under her coat, since the statute, governing the return of runaway children, requires some inquiry by a police officer prior to detaining a juvenile. The officer, based on his knowledge that the bus station attracts passengers carrying illegal drugs, and on his observation of appellant's nervous behavior and the bulge in her midsection, had an objective credible reason to make an informational inquiry.  Moreover, there was no detention of appellant, not even a hint of harassment or intimidation, and her decision to turn over the contraband was not the result of coercion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a juvenile delinquency proceeding arising out of appellant's handing over to a police officer a quantity of cocaine after being questioned on a bus, the officer had the statutory authority and even the duty to approach and question appellant, an unaccompanied, youthful-looking 14-year-old girl who was in a location known to be frequented by truants and runaways and to have a high incidence of drug activity </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Family Ct Act &sect; 718 [a]).  Moreover, even if it were conceded that appellant was detained by the police officers after having boarded the bus, her detention would be authorized under the circumstances by section 718, and there is no dispute that she voluntarily opened her coat and surrendered the contraband to the officer.  Although appellant's questioning by the officer was noncustodial in nature, even a custodial detention and a search conducted incident thereto would have been justified pursuant to section 718.  Accordingly, appellant's motion to suppress evidence was properly denied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, taxpayers, sought review of the decision of the Supreme Court in Albany County (New York), which found in favor of defendant state in plaintiffs' action challenging the validity of New York's income tax treatment of nonresident taxpayers pursuant to N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Personal Income Tax -- Taxation of Nonresidents</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Tax Law &sect; 651 (b) (2), which requires nonresident taxpayers and their nonresident spouses, like resident taxpayers and their resident spouses, to file a joint New York State income tax return, thereby reporting their aggregate incomes, if they filed a joint Federal tax return, violates due process insofar as it may be applied to require a nonresident spouse of a nonresident taxpayer to file a joint State tax return solely by reason of the marital relationship and the filing by the couple of a joint Federal income tax return. Due process requires some definite link, some minimum connection, between a State and the person, property or transaction it seeks to tax, and out-of-State cohabitation with a spouse having New York income and filing a joint Federal income tax return with that spouse cannot constitute the necessary minimum connection for the extraterritorial exercise of New York's taxing power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Personal Income Tax -- Taxation of Nonresidents</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Inasmuch as Tax Law &sect; 651 (b) (2) violates due process insofar as it may be applied to require a nonresident spouse of a nonresident taxpayer to file a joint New York State income tax return solely by reason of the marital relationship and the filing by the couple of a joint Federal income tax return, constitutional challenges to the validity of Tax Law &sect; 601 (d), (e) that were based upon the interaction of those sections with section 651 (b) (2) are academic.  The language of section 601 (d), (e) is &quot;marriage neutral&quot;, and once a nonresident spouse having no New York income is no longer obligated to file a joint return, the remaining sections of the Tax Law at issue are not subject to the objection that they increase a nonresident taxpayer's State tax liability on the basis of the non-New York income of that taxpayer's nonresident spouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Personal Income Tax -- Taxation of Nonresidents</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Tax Law &sect; 601 (e), which provides for a two-step process to determine the income tax due from nonresidents, does not violate due process, and the claim that its inclusion of a nonresident's non-New York income in the initial determination of the tax before applying an apportionment formula is the functional equivalent of a tax on that out-of-State income is unavailing, since the procedure for taxing the New York source income of a nonresident by initially applying a progressive tax rate to the taxpayer's income from all sources and then apportioning to fix the final tax due, is a valid means of using income not itself taxable as part of the measurement of the tax imposed on the nonresident's New York income.  Plaintiffs, who are challenging the constitutionality of the law, have not demonstrated that under the statute their income from non-New York sources is used in any respect other than as a measurement of the tax due on New York income, that is, in determining the rate of taxation applied to their New York income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Personal Income Tax -- Taxation of Nonresidents</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Tax Law &sect; 601 (e), which provides for a two-step process to determine the income tax due from nonresidents, does not discriminate against nonresident taxpayers in favor of New York residents by counting a nonresident's income from New York sources to determine the appropriate tax rate to be applied to a nonresident's New York income, and, hence, is not unconstitutional, since the applicable tax rate for both residents and nonresidents is derived in the same manner and from the same ultimate source, i.e., Federal adjusted gross income, generally constituting income from all sources.  Resident and nonresident taxpayers similarly situated in terms of ability to pay taxes out of all sources of income are treated the same within the parameters of New York's progressive income taxation system.  Moreover, it is unpersuasive to assert that discrimination against nonresident taxpayers exists because apportionment under the statutes to fix the final tax due dilutes the value of their deductions and exemptions, as compared to their value for resident taxpayers, since to whatever extent application of the ratio of New York income to total income dilutes the value of exemptions and deductions for nonresidents, it does so in direct proportion to the reduction of the final tax due from nonresidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Personal Income Tax -- Taxation of Nonresidents</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A constitutional challenge by nonresidents to Tax Law &sect; 601 (d), which imposes a tax on unearned income from non-New York sources of nonresidents, is meritless since that statute, by its own terms, does not apply directly to nonresident taxpayers; however, the unearned income of a nonresident does enter into the calculation to arrive at the nonresident's tax liability under Tax Law &sect; 601 (e), because the initial determination of tax is made &quot;as if such nonresident * * * were a resident&quot;.  Nonetheless, the inclusion of the additional tax on unearned income in the two-step computation performed pursuant to section 601 (e) merely serves to add marginally to the tax rate applied to the nonresident's New York income, and the validity of that use of non-New York income in taxing the New York income of a nonresident taxpayer has been sustained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Actions -- Class Actions -- Superior Form of Litigation -- Stare Decisis -- Governmental Defendant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In an action challenging the constitutionality of various provisions of the Tax Law which pertain to the taxation of nonresidents' income, denial of class action certification was proper where the constitutional issues regarding liability have been resolved and the determination of the invalidity of Tax Law &sect; 651 (b) (2), as applied, will be given stare decisis effect in any future litigation.  Moreover, defendant governmental agencies have stipulated to being bound by the determination on all duly and timely filed administrative claims.  The remaining unresolved issues for entitlement to monetary relief appear to be primarily personal to the individual members of the class of nonresident taxpayers, i.e., eligibility for a refund and the amount of overpayment.  Moreover, no cause of action lies for restitution of an unconstitutionally collected tax that was paid voluntarily and, hence, entitlement to monetary relief will require some initiative on the part of the individual taxpayer, by way of protest or proper claim for a refund. Consequently, the superiority of a class action over other methods of dispute resolution has not been established.  </SPAN></P>

The court reversed the decision, reinstated the complaint, and granted the judgment, holding that the statute was rationally related to the legitimate state purpose of ensuring that the sales tax was efficiently collected without imposing double taxation. Although a non-installing contractor had to collect the sales tax, he was entitled to seek a rebate, thereby avoiding double taxation.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Discharge of Juror</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a criminal prosecution in which a juror called court staff on Monday morning to advise that he was in Florida attempting to secure a return flight on &quot;standby&quot;, the trial court's abrupt decision to replace the juror, after criticizing the juror's actions as irresponsible and deciding that with no assurances as to his availability the next day his discharge was warranted, did not properly measure the defendant's important rights in jury selection since the court had determined the juror's whereabouts, yet no further attempts were made to ascertain the success of his ongoing return flight efforts.  Moreover, defense counsel's request for a one-day adjournment to allow the juror's return was reasonable, especially in view of the lack of opposition by the People, and had the absent juror not appeared the next morning, the court then could have proceeded to discharge him.  In addition, the stage of the trial and witness availability factors counseled patience since only the summations and jury charge remained, and the better course would have been to adjourn the trial one day before proceeding further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Assault -- Substantial Pain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a prosecution for assault, an examination of the photographs depicting various bruises and marks on the complaining witness as well as the testimony in the record reveals that neither the bruises depicted nor the victim's description of his pain, coupled with the fact that he did not seek medical attention for his bruises, the worst of which healed in about a week, were sufficient to support an assault conviction. While the bruises depicted undoubtedly caused some pain to the complainant, the necessary evidence of &quot;substantial pain&quot; is lacking and, thus, dismissal of the assault charge is warranted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A judgment convicting defendant of harassment pursuant to Penal Law &sect; 240.25 (2) for using abusive and obscene language in a public place must be reversed and the corresponding count of the indictment dismissed since the Court of Appeals has struck down that statute for overbreadth, concluding that the statute, on its face, prohibits a substantial amount of constitutionally protected expression and that its continued existence presents a significant risk of prosecution for the mere exercise of free speech. Inasmuch as the instant case is on direct appeal, the Court of Appeals decision controls retroactively.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction for dismantling a vehicle without a registration. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, holding that it was more than reasonable to infer that defendant was in the business of acquiring motor vehicles for the purpose of dismantling them for parts when the investigator found that he had 15 or 20 salvage or junk motor vehicles in his yard, and he and defendant looked at several cars before they found one from which they could remove an alternator, which defendant sold to the investigator. The court determined that defendant's prosecution was not the result of the unconstitutional selective enforcement of the law in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution because defendant did not sustain his burden of establishing a conscious and intentional discrimination against him, as the record reflected that there were prosecutions in less than one percent of the cases because the offenders agreed to and registered, so the matter was then considered resolved.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court judgment. The court held that interim or stop-gap legislation was permissible in order to maintain the status quo pending new legislation, but that the town board failed to offer any satisfactory reasons for the nearly five-year delay in enacting a zoning ordinance. The court concluded that the trial court properly directed the issuance of a building permit because the petitioner had already received site plan review and approval under the old moratorium law; therefore, review and approval under the new moratorium law was redundant. The court held that the town board's denial of petitioner's request for a variance from the moratorium was arbitrary and capricious because its stated reasons for the denial were either irrelevant or unsupported in the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1105(c)(6) (1990) was implemented the comptroller notified the municipalities that all parking services furnished by the municipalities were subject to a new tax except parking services offered through meters on public streets. The municipalities argued that the statute was unconstitutional as it applied to them. They claimed that the providing of metered municipal parking fields for use by their respective constituents to be a municipal obligation and they were not vendors of services of a kind not ordinarily sold by private persons. On review the court found that the municipalities failed to show that the service was not one also ordinarily provided by public vendors and affirmed.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A determination of the State Comptroller and State Department of Taxation and Finance imposing a sales tax on revenues received by municipalities from off-street parking fees </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Tax Law &sect; 1105 [c] [6]) is not the result of an unreasonable interpretation of the statute, since section 1105 (c) (6) explicitly provides for such tax on receipts obtained from providing &quot;parking, garaging or storing for motor vehicles&quot;, and, notwithstanding the general rule that a tax statute is to be construed in favor of the taxpayer, petitioner municipalities, which concededly qualify as &quot;persons&quot; subject to the statute, have failed to show that the provision of parking facilities is not a service also ordinarily provided by private vendors, who, by making parking available, also serve the same public interest of aiding the free flow of traffic, but are taxed nonetheless.  Accordingly, petitioners may be considered &quot;vendors&quot; for purposes of the statute, and the fact that they assertedly do not profit from their parking facilities is of little consequence since there is no requirement in the Tax Law that one who renders a service must make a profit before that service is taxable.  Moreover, the operation of municipal parking lots is a proprietary, not a governmental, function.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Sales and Use Taxes -- Revenues Received by Municipalities from Off-Street Parking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Tax Law &sect; 1105 (c) (6), which imposes a sales tax on revenues received by vendors of off-street parking, is applicable to municipalities which operate off-street parking facilities, and the argument of petitioner municipalities that respondents acted arbitrarily in excluding municipal parking lots and fields from the statutory exception created for &quot;on-street&quot; metered parking, is unconvincing, since respondents' distinction between off-street and on-street parking is rational in light of the fact that the latter is not ordinarily sold by private persons </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Tax Law &sect; 1101 [b] [8] [i] [H]; &sect; 1116 [a] [1]), while off-street parking commonly is.  As to whether that distinction is equitable, in the application of tax statutes, unlike many others, it cannot be assumed that when the Legislature designed the particular statute it had either a specific or even a general desire to achieve a fair or balanced formula; rather, the objective may well have been the production of optimum revenue.  Moreover, the failure of the Legislature to enact &quot;curative&quot; legislation is indicative of its acceptance of respondents' interpretation of the law.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to felony charges on the condition that the trial court disregard her status as a predicate felon and sentence her to a term of probation rather than impose a mandatory period of incarceration. The trial court imposed probation in the interest of justice and on the ground that imposition of the mandatory sentence would constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Defendant, the single mother of infant children, was HIV positive and in the final stage before the onset of AIDS. The court modified on the law, affirmed, and remitted the case for further proceedings. The courts did not possess &quot;interest of justice&quot; jurisdiction to impose a sentence less than the mandatory statutory minimum. In addition, the imposition of the mandated sentence would not be unconstitutional as applied to defendant. The fact that defendant was HIV positive or suffered from AIDS was not a sufficient reason to modify an otherwise lawful sentence of imprisonment. Because defendant's plea was specifically conditioned upon the imposition of probation, defendant would be given the opportunity to withdraw her plea.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff father and defendant mother agreed on an amount of child support to be paid by the father for the benefit of the parties' child. Eight years later, the mother filed a motion, which sought, among other things, to vacate the court-approved agreement between the parties, to grant interim child support, and to provide a retroactive lump-sum payment. The trial court (New York) denied the motion. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court addressed one issue, the alleged unconscionability of the bargain, although the trial court did not discuss it. The court noted, however, that the difficulty with invocation of the doctrine to reopen the contract, made by the parties for their child born out of wedlock, was that the presumptive inequality of two such contracting parties was considered and preempted by the legislature in enacting N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 516. In recognition of a well-founded perception that a man and a woman enmeshed in such a relationship were almost never in combat on a level playing field, the statute had crafted some fairly elaborate machinery to restore the balance. The trial court, which reviewed the bargain, found the consideration tendered by the father adequate. Thus, the court held that no tribunal of the state was competent, eight years later, to revise the settlement. The court further reasoned that its conclusion was only strengthened by the subsequent conduct of the parties. When the father had once withheld payments, the mother enforced the father's compliance with a contempt proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial and dismissal of mother's application to vacate the court-approved agreement between the parties and for related relief.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent and Child -- Support -- Agreement between Parents -- Vacatur of Agreement Approved by Court -- Unconscionability</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An order denying defendant mother's motion to vacate a court-approved agreement providing for the support of the parties' out-of-wedlock child should be affirmed.  Although defendant now asserts that the eight-year-old agreement is unconscionable, any judicial examination into the inequality or overreaching of the parties when the agreement was executed is foreclosed by the Legislature's enactment of Family Court Act &sect; 516, which contains elaborate machinery to safeguard the position of each party.  The fact that a postexecution paternity test showed plaintiff to be the child's father should not affect the stability of the agreement since the test was within the contemplation of the parties at the time the agreement was made, and the results of that test were not reserved by either party as a future escape hatch; nor was any such suggestion made before the Justice who approved the agreement less than one month later.  Therefore, no tribunal is now competent to revise the settlement.  Moreover, defendant's subsequent conduct, viz., engaging in litigation to enforce the agreement, clearly indicates that she ratified the agreement.  </SPAN></P>

The court found that the Connecticut crimes were all considered misdemeanor offenses under New York law, and therefore, they could not have served as predicate felonies for the purpose of his sentencing as a persistent felony offender.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two combined actions for declaratory judgment and proceedings in the Supreme Court, Ulster County (New York), petitioners, Commissioners of Public Works, sought to annul a determination by respondent mayor that rescinded their appointments as members of the Board of Public Works. The trial court found the portion of the city charter the mayor relied on was unconstitutional and found for the Commissioners. The mayor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mayor claimed the Commissioners had been appointed in violation of a provision of the city charter which provided that not more than two Commissioners could belong to the same political party or be of the same political opinion on state and national issues. According to the mayor, even though one Commissioner was a Conservative and one was a Republican, because they both supported the same candidates in the most recent presidential and gubernatorial elections, they were of the same political opinion. The court affirmed the judgment. The city charter, which provided that not more than two commissioners should be of the same political opinion on state and national issues, was unconstitutionally vague. The provision of the city charter failed to provide any objective standards or criteria in order to determine whether more than two commissioners were of the same political opinion on state and national issues and impermissibly placed complete discretion in the hands of those who enforced the provision to determine who would be disqualified from serving as commissioner. The charter provision was arbitrary and had a discriminatory application, which was deemed unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial court's order dismissing the petition for review and declared the ordinance to be unconstitutional. The court held that the ordinance could not survive the void-for-vagueness test because a lack of a reasonable degree of definiteness pervaded various provisions of the ordinance, which contained no objective standards by which one could determine the quantum of emissions of odors constituting a &quot;minimum concentration&quot; or by which to determine whether a person was of &quot;average odor sensitivity.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner, a World War II veteran, had been receiving a $ 5,000 exemption from payment of real property taxes, pursuant to Real Prop.

Petitioner sought review of the town board's repeal of the local tax law, contending that the state preempted the issue, and the town board's repeal of the local law unconstitutionally removed a vested right he had in continuing to receive the real property tax exemption. The trial court dismissed the petitioner's request for review. The petitioner appealed the dismissal. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the petition but held that the petitioner's challenge to the constitutionality of the local law should have been brought as a declaratory judgment action and thus converted the proceeding. The court concluded that the town board's repeal of the local tax law providing property tax exemptions to veterans was not unconstitutional because &sect; 458 (5) (a) specifically reserved to local governments the right to repeal laws opting out of or reducing the ceiling on such exemptions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A petition seeking review of a determination of a town board which repealed a local law providing for a veteran's exemption from real property taxes was properly dismissed. There is no indication, express or implied, that the Legislature intended to preempt the area of veterans' real property tax exemptions beyond the $ 5,000 exclusion that RPTL 458 (1) and (2) provide, and the statute specifically reserves to local authorities the decision of whether to adjust the exemption proportionally by the amount which the assessed valuation of the property has increased or decreased as a result of the change to full value assessment </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, RPTL 458 [5] [a]).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A petition seeking review of a determination of a town board which repealed a local law providing for a veteran's exemption from real property taxes was properly dismissed. Citizens have no vested right in statutory exemptions, and a taxing authority is not foreclosed from changing its view respecting the continued allowance of a tax exemption because the passage of time creates no vested right in a tax exemption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Exemptions -- Repeal of Veteran's Exemption by Locality -- Authority of Locality to Repeal Exemption</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A petition seeking review of a determination of a town board which repealed a local law providing for a veteran's exemption from real property taxes was properly dismissed. Local governments have the authority to adopt, amend or supersede laws so long as the &quot;new&quot; legislation is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution or any general law </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, NY Const, art IX, &sect; 3 [b]; Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 10 [1] [i], [ii] [a] [8], [9]; &sect; 22 [1]), and in light of the similarity of language and purpose of RPTL 458-a (4) (a) and RPTL 458 (5) (a), which authorized local governments to adjust a veteran's exemption in the same proportion as affected by full value assessment, it may be fairly implied that the Legislature similarly intended RPTL 458 (5) (a) to permit local governments to repeal laws enacted pursuant thereto, such as the local law in question, since the Legislature has expressly embraced the concept that localities could reduce or eliminate exemptions created pursuant to RPTL 458-a.  Moreover, inasmuch as the local law in question neither prohibits that which State law permits nor permits that which State law forbids, there is no inconsistency with State legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Actions -- Improper Form of Action -- Conversion to Proper Form -- Challenge to Repeal of Tax Exemption</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A challenge to the constitutionality of a local law repealing a veteran's real property tax exemption should have been brought as a declaratory judgment action. Accordingly, pursuant to CPLR 103 (c), the instant article 78 proceeding is converted to the proper form. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated actions, appellants, town and assessor, challenged judgments of the Supreme Court of Suffolk County (New York), which found for respondent taxpayers. The town and the assessor argued that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the taxpayers because there were factual issues in dispute as to whether the delayed real estate assessment as part of a comprehensive reassessment program was unconstitutional discrimination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town implemented a comprehensive real estate reassessment program. Delays resulted in the reassessment of some parcels of real estate before others. The taxpayers filed actions against the town and the assessor, claiming that the delayed assessment in some parcels was invidious and unconstitutional discrimination against them, and they claimed refunds for assessments that they had paid. The taxpayers' motions for summary judgment were granted by the trial court. The town and the assessor appealed. In a consolidated action, the court reversed the grants of summary judgment, holding that material facts were in dispute with respect to the constitutional issues raised. A primary question was the nature and extent of the purported inequities. An additional question was how long the inequities would persist. It could not be determined whether any disparate tax treatment arose out of an intentional, invidious, or arbitrary discrimination by the town or the assessor. The record did not reveal whether the town acted in bad faith or that the taxpayers were singled out for selective enforcement of tax laws that applied equally to all similarly situated taxpayers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In actions seeking a refund of real estate taxes attributable to increased assessments imposed on plaintiffs' properties as a result of a comprehensive reassessment program implemented by defendant town, under which plan every parcel in the town is to be reassessed either when it was sold, subdivided, improved or selected for scrutiny under the town's &quot;land equalization program&quot;, summary judgment was improperly granted directing refunds to plaintiffs, since material and unresolved questions of fact exist with respect to whether the purported delay in the complete implementation of the reassessment program amounted to invidious and unconstitutional discrimination against plaintiffs.  A tax classification will only violate equal protection guarantees if the distinction between classes is palpably arbitrary.  Primary questions requiring resolution are the nature and extent of the purported inequities, how long such inequities will persist, and whether any disparate treatment arose out of an intentional, invidious, or arbitrary discrimination. It cannot be said on the record in this case that defendants acted in bad faith or singled out plaintiffs for selective enforcement of tax laws that apply equally to all similarly situated taxpayers.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that the parental interest asserted by respondent was unworthy of legal protection and rendered his consent to the adoption unnecessary. The court noted that respondent failed to commence proceedings during the pregnancy, that his name was not on the child's birth certificate, and that he consented to the child's placement in foster care. The court found that respondent did not have a genuine desire to assume full custody.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, theatre owners and trade organizations, sought to annul the designation of 22 theatres as landmarks, and to declare null and void the underlying landmarks legislation and the anti-demolition provisions of an ordinance.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Landmarks Preservation -- Designation of Buildings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a proceeding to annul the designation of 22 Broadway theatres as landmarks, the court is circumscribed by the scope of judicial review of administrative determinations, and may not substitute its judgment for that of the appropriate administrative body, viz., the Landmarks Preservation Commission, whose members have particular expertise.  Considering the wealth of analyses and reports, as well as anecdotal testimony, provided to the Commission prior to the subject designations, it appears beyond serious challenge that a reasonable basis existed for the designations as to each theatre, upon a consideration of the statutory criteria. There is no basis to argue that the proposals were &quot;railroaded&quot; through the Commission since the preliminary analyses and reports were exhaustive, and the decision making occurred over the course of several years; there is no indication that petitioners were deprived of a meaningful opportunity to be heard prior to the determinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Landmarks Preservation -- Designation of Buildings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a proceeding to annul the designation of 22 Broadway theatres as landmarks, the single roll-call vote of the New York City Board of Estimate approving the recommendations of the Landmarks Preservation Commission was not improper where the Board had received individual reports, as well as planning commission reports, prior to the vote, and where the Board had, since the 1950's, routinely entertained a single vote on similar matters, particularly those involving zoning and landmark designations. Although manipulation of the landmarks law for the purpose of preserving the Broadway theatre industry, rather than individual theatres, would have been improper, the designation proceedings addressed the specific buildings in terms of the criteria of the law.  Accordingly, the administrative determination was based on substantial evidence, was not arbitrary and capricious, and did not violate the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Landmarks Preservation -- Constitutionality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a proceeding to annul the designation of 22 Broadway theatres as landmarks, the constitutionality of the landmarks preservation law has previously been upheld and petitioners have not carried their burden of demonstrating that the law as applied to their particular theatres denies them essential use of their property.  The law serves a legitimate purpose of saving historical landmarks, and with respect to any claim that petitioners are deprived of any economic use of their property, in the absence of final agency action on applications by petitioners for renovations or alterations, the matter is not ripe for review.  There is no prohibition against petitioners receiving economic benefit from continuing to use the buildings as theatres, and transferable development rights inure to the owners of those buildings, which, absent a successful challenge, must be presumed to have economic benefit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a proceeding to annul the designation of 22 Broadway theatres as landmarks, petitioners' challenge to the provision of the zoning resolution which requires listed theatres to obtain a special permit from the city planning commission for demolition is a zoning, rather than a landmark matter, and petitioners bear the heavy burden of demonstrating the unconstitutionality of the zoning ordinance.  Discriminatory effects of a statute will not render it invalid if there exists a reasonable basis, and there is no evidence that the provision in question is not based on a comprehensive plan inasmuch as similar demolition permits are required by the resolution in several other special districts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In a proceeding to annul the designation of 22 Broadway theatres as landmarks, considering the narrow scope of review available to the Supreme Court, it cannot be said that with the volumes of documentary evidence in the record and supporting affidavits, that there was a need to conduct an evidentiary hearing to examine whether the New York City Board of Estimate's voting mechanism was arbitrary and capricious or in violation of law.  Since the court was not empowered to substitute its own judgment for that of the administrative body, the only inquiry was whether the record, as submitted, supported the single roll-call voting procedure and the determination, and it did.  </SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court held that (1) ch. 473 violated the owners' right to due process by abrogating a fixed and unreviewable judgment through later legislation; (2) the owners' right to equal protection was violated by imposing a classification whose relationship to the asserted goal of reducing the housing shortage was so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational; (3) ch. 473 functioned as an improper regulatory taking without compensation because it denied the owners the economic value of their property; (4) it was error to conclude that ch. 473 was unconstitutional for lack of a home rule message; (5) ch. 473 was not a physical taking of property without just compensation or a bill of attainder; and (6) ch. 473 did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that although the Statute of Limitations for the declaratory action at bar was six years, the trial court properly awarded back pay for a period greater than six years because the statute did not circumscribe the number of years for which the ancillary relief of back pay could be awarded. The court concluded that inasmuch as the judges were successful on their constitutional claim, which was cognizable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, the trial court properly awarded counsel fees. However, the court concluded that the award of prejudgment interest by the trial court was improper.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner artist appealed from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New York County (New York), which annulled a decision of respondent Environmental Control Board and which had remanded five charges of violating New York City, N.Y., Rules of the City of New York, tit. 10, &sect; 121(e) back to the Environmental Control Board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The artist produced handbills advertising his performances, but he did not post any handbills or give anyone instructions to post the handbills. Before prosecuting people for continuous posting violations, the city had a policy of requiring a second observation of a poster three days after the initial violation. Administratively, the artist was found liable for violating New York City, N.Y., Rules of the City of New York, tit. 10, &sect; 121(e), and a civil penalty was imposed for each violation. The lower court annulled all of the administrative convictions and remanded five back for a new hearing under &sect; 121(e). The court affirmed the lower court with a modification; the court found that the five remaining charges should be dismissed because &sect; 121(e) was unconstitutional as applied. The court ruled that the artist's free speech rights under the First Amendment were violated by holding him responsible for posting when his only connection to the posting was having his names on the posters. The court also held that &sect; 121(e) was unconstitutionally vague because the prohibitions were so unclear that people of common intelligence were required to guess at what was proscribed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Regulation of Handbill Posting -- Vicarious Liability -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Unconstitutionality</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> of Ordinance as Applied</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 10-121 (e), which provides that if handbills are posted on certain public property without permission on a &quot;regular and ongoing basis&quot;, then the individual whose name appears thereon shall be deemed to have knowledge of such illegal posting and shall be liable for a civil penalty, is unconstitutional as applied to petitioner, whose name appeared on handbills which were discovered to have been posted without permission, since the only behavior chargeable to petitioner is having his name on posted handbills which he produced and distributed to others -- an activity fully protected by the First Amendment -- without ever instructing them to post the same.  To hold petitioner vicariously liable because of someone else's conduct in illegally posting the handbills would offend First Amendment principles and violate due process.  If the city wishes to prohibit the posting of handbills without permission, it can pursue its goal by punishing those who actually post the handbills. Mere observance by the distributor of the handbills posted at various locations at some later date does not logically suggest that the distributor took part in the illegal posting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Regulation of Handbill Posting -- Constitutionality of Ordinance -- Police Powers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A municipal ordinance prohibiting the posting of handbills on certain public property without permission is entitled to a strong presumption of validity, which imposes a heavy burden on anyone challenging its constitutionality.  In exercising the power granted by NY Constitution, article IX, &sect; 2 (c) and Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 10, which vest a city with broad powers in the regulation of the use of its streets and public areas for the general welfare, a city may legitimately place limits on the manner in which public areas are used as a forum for speech and other types of protected expression. Accordingly, a content-neutral antiposting law is an appropriate exercise of municipal police power to regulate aesthetics and promote safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Regulation of Handbill Posting -- Unconstitutionally Vague Ordinance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 10-121 (e), which provides for civil penalties for illegally posting handbills, is unconstitutionally vague since it proscribes a violation that continues &quot;on a regular and ongoing basis&quot;.  Although a more stringent vagueness test should apply if a law interferes with the right of free speech, greater tolerance is allowed where civil rather than criminal penalties attach, as is the case with the statute in question, because the consequences of imprecision are qualitatively less severe.  The law contains no hint as to how much time must pass or what events must occur before a violation becomes &quot;continuing&quot;; furthermore, it is unclear what &quot;regular&quot; adds to the statute.  Although statutes should be construed to avoid constitutional problems, and the city does not act against a violator until a handbill has twice been observed, the wait between sightings serves no purpose, since it has no bearing on whether the violator has knowledge that the posting has occurred, given that one may violate the statute by printing and distributing handbills with one's name on them that are illegally posted by others.  Moreover, one charged with violating the statute is not given notice during the waiting period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Regulation of Handbill Posting -- Unconstitutionally Vague Ordinance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 10-121 (e), which provides that if handbills are posted on certain public property without permission on a &quot;regular and ongoing basis&quot;, then the individual whose name appears thereon shall be deemed to have knowledge of such illegal posting and shall be liable for a civil penalty, is unconstitutionally vague since the law seems to make any person whose name appears on the handbill liable, even though that person neither produced, distributed nor knew about the handbill; nor is it clear who is liable if several names are listed.  A person of common intelligence cannot know which nonliteral statutory interpretation to follow, and the scope of the law and the discretion it gives to enforcement agents is completely open-ended.  The law has the potential for chilling First Amendment freedoms.  Moreover, the law may not be deemed valid by construing it as a reasonable regulation of the time, place or manner in which one may engage in protected forms of expression, since the imposition of vicarious liability is unrelated to the time, place or manner of the liable person's conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Regulation of Handbill Posting -- Unconstitutionally Vague Ordinance -- Overbreadth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 10-121 (e), which provides that if handbills are posted on certain public property without permission on a &quot;regular and ongoing basis&quot;, then the individual whose name appears thereon shall be deemed to have knowledge of such illegal posting and shall be liable for a civil penalty, is unconstitutionally vague, and may not be saved as a reasonable regulation directed at commercial speech, since it applies to anyone whose name appears on a posting, commercial or otherwise.  Nothing in the statute&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see also</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 10-119) nor any interpretation by the city indicates that the law is limited to commercial speech. Thus, assuming a regulation such as section 10-121 (e) is proper in the area of commercial speech, it is constitutionally overbroad since it applies to all political, social, cultural or other protected expression found posted in the proscribed areas, and the overbreadth is substantial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Regulation of Handbill Posting -- Due Process -- Failure to Charge Violator with Offense for which Ultimately Found Liable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Petitioner was improperly found liable of violating Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 10-121 (e), which provides that if handbills are posted on certain public property without permission in violation of Administrative Code &sect; 10-119 on a &quot;regular and ongoing basis&quot;, then the individual whose name appears thereon shall be deemed to have knowledge of such illegal posting and shall be liable for a civil penalty, where petitioner appealed the finding that he had violated section 10-119 and, on administrative appeal, the charges against petitioner were amended to assert a violation of section 10-121 (e), which creates an offense different from that defined in section 10-119, which renders liable the person who actually did the posting. Section 10-121 contains additional elements and in some respects the penalties differ.  The amendment of the charges against petitioner on appeal violated fundamental due process rights, and where there is a denial of the right to be put on notice of the charges made, prejudice will be presumed.  </SPAN></P>

It was within the sound discretion of the district attorney to decline to prosecute that offense. Although the plea agreement provided for a sentence beyond the maximum for grand larceny in the second degree as a second felony offender, the trial court corrected the inadvertent misstatement at sentencing. The trial court did not err in refusing defendant a hearing concerning withdrawal of his guilty pleas and his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel where he only proffered conclusory statements of coercion and was afforded sufficient opportunity to protest his counsel during the plea allocution. Defendant was properly treated as a second felony offender where his prior federal felony conviction was proved beyond a reasonable doubt and was comparable to a state felony conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners filed an application with the Commissioner to suspend alternate side of the street parking in observance of St. Patrick's Day. The Commissioner denied the application, and the trial court reversed. On appeal, the court reversed finding that the trial court was without power to direct the Commissioner to grant petitioners' request because it involved a question of policy that was beyond the scope of judicial review. The court found that the suspension of alternate side parking regulations on designated holidays involved a legislative prerogative upon which courts should not intrude and, further, that other circumstances warranting a suspension of the regulation was an administrative determination that was entrusted by city council to the Commissioner's discretion. The court found that the Commissioner did not abuse his discretion in refusing to extend the suspension of parking restrictions to occasions that were not designated by statute. The court also rejected petitioners' claim that the designation of certain religious holidays in the statute violated the establishment clause and determined that petitioners' remedy was to present their cause before the city council.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The people appealed an order of the Supreme Court in Queens County (New York) which granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence, determining that the N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 415-a(5)(a) violated N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant owned a vehicle dismantling yard. After a warrantless inspection, police examined defendant's records and found stolen auto parts were not properly inventoried under &sect; 415-a(5)(a). They arrested defendant and charged him with penal law violations. The hearing court determined that &sect; 415-a(5)(a) violated the state constitution. In doing so, it declined to follow the U.S. Supreme Court's conclusion that warrantless inspections were authorized under the statute and were reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. On appeal, the court reversed, upholding the constitutionality of &sect; 415-a(5)(a) because it found no constitutional infirmities. The state could address the major problem of auto theft by both an administrative scheme and through penal sanctions. Neither the applicable policy concerns nor fundamental fairness considerations predominated over the desirability of consistency and uniformity in constitutional construction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 415-a (5) (a), which provides that vehicle dismantlers must maintain records concerning proof of ownership of motor vehicles and parts which they acquire, and that such records must be made available to authorized inspectors during business hours, does not violate NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 12, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. The statute has previously withstood challenge on Federal constitutional grounds, and the identity of language between the Federal and State Constitutions supports a policy of uniformity in interpretation.  Defendant, who has been charged with criminal possession of stolen property, grand larceny and falsifying business records, has failed to show that the right at issue has historically been afforded greater protection in New York than is currently required under the Federal Constitution, that the right is of peculiar State or local concern, or that New Yorkers have &quot;distinctive attitudes&quot; toward that right.</SPAN></P>

In a criminal prosecution arising out of an administrative search of a vehicle dismantling business </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 415-a [5] [a]), the holding of the hearing court, that NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 12 affords defendant greater protection from searches and seizures than the Federal Constitution, impinged upon the policy and rule-making function traditionally perceived as the exclusive domain of the Court of Appeals.  Where, as here, &quot;noninterpretative&quot;, State-wide policy considerations govern, in part, any inquiry into the existence of enhanced protection by the State Constitution, lower courts must temper their actions with restraint in deference to the Court of Appeals' role as the State's policy-making tribunal; that is particularly so where the hearing court discerns in the State Constitution rights which the Appellate Division has twice declined to recognize when examining the statute in question under the identically worded provision of the Federal Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 415-a (5) (a), which provides that vehicle dismantlers must maintain records concerning proof of ownership of motor vehicles and parts which they acquire, and that such records must be made available to authorized inspectors during business hours, does not violate NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 12, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. The statute has previously withstood challenge on Federal constitutional grounds, and defendant has not shown that, in upholding the statute, the United States Supreme Court has retreated from previously announced rules, that the right in question has been singled out by the New York Court of Appeals as meriting special protection, as has been done with freedom of speech and right to counsel, or that a separate State rule is justified by concerns peculiar to New Yorkers.  The challenged enactment affects only a relatively small number of commercial establishments operating businesses within an industry which the Legislature has found to be influenced by a multimillion-dollar trade in stolen automobiles and parts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Search and Seizure -- Administrative Search -- Constitutionality -- State Constitution -- Automobile Dismantlers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 415-a (5) (a), which requires vehicle dismantlers to maintain and make available for inspection records concerning proof of ownership of motor vehicles and parts which they acquire, and which has already passed Federal constitutional muster, does not violate the State Constitution.  No reason has been shown to expand the identical language of the State Constitution to strike down what has been deemed permissible under the Federal Constitution.  The United States Supreme Court, in upholding section 415-a (5) (a), did not depart from established principles governing administrative searches, and the statutory scheme at issue, which authorizes searches during business hours, sufficiently defines the scope of any inspection and reasonably limits the discretion of the inspecting officer.  The vehicle dismantling industry is pervasively regulated, and other administrative schemes enacted to discourage criminal conduct have been upheld as legitimately regulatory in character.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Search and Seizure -- Administrative Search -- Automobile Dismantlers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In a prosecution for criminal possession of stolen property, grand larceny, and falsifying business records arising out of an administrative search by police of a vehicle dismantling business operated by defendant, defendant's motion to suppress physical evidence and statements he made to law enforcement officers was improperly granted where the inspectors permissibly requested and examined defendant's &quot;police book&quot; upon arriving at his premises, where they then examined defendant's records to ascertain if any parts had been inventoried in conformity with the regulatory scheme after determining, by random computer check, that certain parts on his premises were listed as stolen, where defendant was arrested only after they determined that parts had not been properly inventoried, and where a search warrant was subsequently obtained pursuant to which a more thorough inspection was conducted.  The conduct of the police inspectors amply established the administrative character of the encounter and undermines the suggestion that defendant was subjected to an inspection motivated solely by a desire to uncover evidence of Penal Law violations.  </SPAN></P>

Respondents filed a motion to dismiss the complaint alleging that petitioners were precluded from seeking judicial relief because they failed to exhaust their administrative remedies under a collective bargaining agreement.

The court held that the grievance and arbitration procedures of the collective bargaining agreement were not intended to supersede the police officer's statutory right to a hearing under N.Y. Civ.

The court further held that the police officer was not obliged to resort to his remedies under the grievance procedure of the collective bargaining agreement before seeking judicial enforcement of his statutory rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff municipality brought an action seeking to enjoin defendant property owner from operating a transfer station/recycling center. The property owner brought a counterclaim seeking a finding that the municipality's transfer station/recycling center permit procedures and zoning regulations were invalid. The Supreme Court in Suffolk County (New York) granted the property owner's motion for summary judgment. The municipality sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner argued that portions of Islip, NY Town Code ch. 21, which regulated solid waste disposal, was invalid because it was inconsistent with N.Y. Town Law &sect; 16. The court found no inconsistency between the laws reasoning that Islip, NY Town Code ch. 21 was not a zoning law merely because it touched the use of land. Rather, the court found that ch. 21 should be regarded as having been enacted pursuant to the municipality's specific power to regulate garbage collection contained in N.Y. Town Law &sect; 136(8) and &sect; 130(6). The court found that the property owner's contention that Islip, NY Town Code &sect; 21-6(B)(9) and &sect; 68-338(D) amount to an unconstitutional summary termination of an existing nonconforming use because the municipality had not provided a reasonable amortization period was not ripe for review because the property owner had not exhausted its administrative remedies. The court reasoned that actual harm would occur only if the property owner's currently pending application for a permit was denied.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- General or Local Laws -- Inconsistencies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An order and judgment of the Supreme Court, which declared that certain local laws regulating the disposal of garbage were inconsistent with a State law of general applicability and that the locality in question had failed to comply with the formalities which are required whenever a local government purports to enact a law which is inconsistent with a State law </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 22), should be reversed where there is no inconsistency.  In accordance with its exercise of its police powers, a locality may regulate, or even ban, places where garbage is brought, dumped, sorted, and processed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2 [c] [ii] [10]; Town Law &sect; 136 [8]; &sect; 130 [6]; ECL 27-0701 [2]; 27-0711).  Consequently, even if the provisions of the local laws in question providing for review and approval by the town Planning Board were inconsistent with the Town Law, it would not follow that the substantive requirements concerning permits and two-acre minimum lot sizes pertaining to garbage disposal sites were similarly invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Regulation of Garbage Disposal Centers -- Local Law Not Zoning Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A local law which regulates garbage disposal sites was not enacted pursuant to Town Law &sect; 261 and, therefore, it is not what is commonly referred to as a &quot;zoning&quot; law.  While the local law contains provisions which require, for example, a certain minimum lot size for the sites, that alone does not transform the local law into one governed by Town Law article 16 where it is clear from a reading of the local law as a whole that it is intended to regulate a particular occupation, rather than regulate the general uses of land.  Inasmuch as there are enabling statutes which specifically authorize town boards to regulate the collection and dumping of garbage </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Town Law &sect; 130 [6]; &sect; 136 [8]) and to establish agencies for the enforcement of such laws, the town need not rely on the general zoning provisions of Town Law article 16 as the source of its power either to enact laws governing garbage processing sites or to create administrative agencies responsible for the enforcement of such laws.  Since the town need not regard article 16 as the source of its power to regulate defendant's property, on which a garbage processing operation is located, it is not bound by the procedural aspects of that article.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Procedures -- Regulation of Garbage Disposal Centers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A town must comply with State statutory zoning procedures only when its local laws represent an exercise of general &quot;zoning&quot; powers, rather than an exercise of a more specific &quot;police&quot; power.  A local law which regulates the operation of garbage disposal centers and applies wherever such activity is carried out in the town, is not a zoning law merely because it touches the use of land.  The local law does not suspend or limit the application of the town's zoning laws, nor does it curtail the powers of the town's Zoning Board of Appeals. Accordingly, the delegation to the town Planning Board of the power to vary the standards set forth in the local law is not inconsistent with the delegation to the zoning board of appeals of the power to vary the standards set forth in that portion of the town code which expressly deals with zoning, because the local law regulating garbage disposal is not a zoning law. Inasmuch as the town did not attempt to supersede State law by enacting an inconsistent local law, compliance with Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 22 was not required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- Grant of Relief to Nonappealing Party -- Challenge to Local Law Regulating Garbage Disposal Centers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In an action commenced by a town to enjoin, pursuant to a local law, defendants from operating a garbage disposal center on their property, acceptance of defendants' argument on appeal with respect to their alleged right to continue a nonconforming use would not warrant the relief granted by Supreme Court, to wit, a declaration that the local law is invalid, which was the only relief expressly requested by defendants in their papers for summary judgment and which is the only relief expressly requested by defendants on appeal.  Inasmuch as acceptance of defendant's argument would warrant relief altogether different from that which was explicitly requested in defendants' notice of motion, and altogether different from that which was granted by Supreme Court, it is not an argument which may serve as an alternative ground for affirmance of the order and judgment appealed from, since acceptance of that argument would require the granting of affirmative relief to defendants, who are nonappealing parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Regulation of Garbage Disposal Centers -- Judicial Review of Ordinance -- Ripeness</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A challenge to a local law which regulates garbage disposal centers and which allegedly amounts to an unconstitutional summary termination of an existing nonconforming use because the locality has not provided a reasonable amortization period, is not ripe for judicial review where the challengers' application for a permit under the ordinance is still pending.  Accordingly, the challengers have not yet suffered an actual, concrete injury.  A claim that a local government's land use laws are unconstitutional as applied, in that they constitute an illegal &quot;taking&quot; of property without just compensation, is not ripe for judicial review until administrative relief has been sought and denied.  Inasmuch as the granting of administrative relief would render the complaining landowner's arguments moot, judicial intervention should be reserved until after the variance has been denied.  Given the lack of actual harm, which may never occur, no justiciable controversy has been presented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Regulation of Garbage Disposal Centers -- Judicial Review of Ordinance -- Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A challenge to a local law which regulates garbage disposal centers and which allegedly amounts to an unconstitutional summary termination of an existing nonconforming use because the locality has not provided a reasonable amortization period, is not judicially reviewable where the challengers' administrative remedies have not been exhausted.  The challengers' claim is premature.  The failure to exhaust administrative remedies may pose a bar to contending that a legislative enactment is unconstitutional as applied.  Exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required where the legislation is challenged on grounds of facial invalidity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Regulation of Garbage Disposal Centers -- Invalid Delegation of Legislative Power to Planning Board</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. A challenge to a local law which regulates garbage disposal centers and which allegedly constitutes an invalid delegation of legislative powers to a town Planning Board is without merit where the local law contains an adequate statement in &quot;general terms&quot; of the appropriate standards governing the planning board's exercise of its power in reviewing variance requests.  The legislation which establishes a minimum lot size states that that requirement will be based on the scale of operation as measured by the size of buildings proposed for a site, the volume of solid waste handled on a daily basis, and the needs for vehicle parking and movement, or a finding that the operation cannot be adequately screened from adjoining property.  Accordingly, those conditions which are to govern the Planning Division's exercise of its power to require a greater lot size are also those which should govern the Board's power to authorize a lesser lot size. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The presentment agency filed an amended petition against the minor. The amended petition alleged that the minor, a 13-year old male, was a juvenile delinquent in that he engaged in sexual intercourse with a 15-year-old female, and that such act, if committed by an adult, constituted the crime of sexual misconduct in violation of N.Y.

The court reversed the family court's order and dismissed the petition. The court held that (1) although &sect; 130.20(1) was unconstitutionally under-inclusive in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, the appropriate remedy was to gender-neutralize the statute and the minor's successful constitutional challenge to &sect; 130.20(1) did not require reversal of his conviction; and that (2) nevertheless the family court's order should have been reversed in the interest of justice, as the parties had stipulated that no force was employed, the minor was only 13 years old at the time, and the minor was no more at fault for his conduct than the female participant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a juvenile delinquency proceeding in which the petition alleged that respondent, a 13-year-old male, engaged in unforced sexual intercourse with a 15-year-old female in violation of Penal Law &sect; 130.20 (1), which defines the crime of sexual misconduct and discriminates on the basis of sex by providing that only a male can commit the crime, petitioner presentment agency has failed to satisfy its burden of demonstrating that the discriminatory treatment is substantially related to the achievement of an important governmental objective and, hence, not violative of constitutional guarantees of equal protection, where the purported objective is the prevention of teen-age pregnancies, since a female of any age can be a victim.  Accordingly, the statute is not specifically related to preventing teen-age pregnancies. Assuming that the prevention of early pregnancy is the governmental objective, petitioner has failed to demonstrate that that goal can be better served by a gender-based law than by a gender-neutral law.  Insofar as nonforcible sexual intercourse is concerned, petitioner has failed to present any cogent reason why deterring only the male would further the prevention of pregnancy better than imposing a sanction upon both participants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although Penal Law &sect; 130.20 (1), which provides that the crime of sexual misconduct can be committed only by a male, is unconstitutionally underinclusive, striking the statute is not the proper remedy.  The court's task is to discern what the Legislature would have done had it foreseen the court's conclusions as to underinclusiveness.  Upon a review of recent legislative activity, it must be concluded that, given a choice between striking the gender bias or striking the statute in its entirety, the Legislature, as revealed by its 1987 action gender-neutralizing the rape statutes, would opt to gender-neutralize sexual misconduct. Therefore, the appropriate remedy is to strike the gender exemption and preserve the statute.  Consequently, in a juvenile delinquency proceeding arising out of the nonforcible sexual intercourse between respondent, a 13-year-old male, and a 15-year-old female, respondent's constitutional challenge, albeit successful, does not require reversal of his conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Infants -- Juvenile Delinquents -- Sexual Misconduct -- Respondent as Victim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a juvenile delinquency proceeding in which respondent was found to have committed an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute sexual misconduct (Penal Law &sect; 130.20 [1]), reversal is not required upon the ground that respondent, a 13-year-old male, was incapable as a matter of law of committing sexual misconduct. Although victims under the age of 17 are deemed incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Penal Law &sect; 130.05 [3] [a]), and cannot be subjected to penal sanctions for their conduct, respondent is not a victim.  Respondent is charged with committing nonforcible sexual intercourse with a 15-year-old female, and his consent is not an essential element of the crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Infants -- Juvenile Delinquents -- Sexual Misconduct -- Reversal of Delinquency Finding in Interest of Justice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A Family Court order adjudicating respondent a juvenile delinquent upon a finding that he committed an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute sexual misconduct (Penal Law &sect; 130.20 [1]), should be reversed in the interest of justice where the parties have stipulated that no force was employed and that respondent was only 13 years old at the time.  The female participant, who was two years older, could not be charged as the perpetrator by reason of the gender bias expressed in the sexual misconduct statute, which provides that only males can commit the crime.  Respondent's act amounted to a crime only because the female could not consent by reason of her age.  Accordingly, respondent was no more at fault factually for his conduct than the female participant, and his adjudication as a delinquent solely by reason of a gender-based statute was manifestly unfair.  </SPAN></P>

Neither the sister nor the mother communicated a willingness to take the child. The father indicated that his &quot;pride&quot; made him want to keep the child. At the time of the hearing on the birth mother's surrender of the child for adoption, the father was in jail awaiting sentencing on a criminal charge. The family court applied N.Y. Dom. Rel.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sellers filed an action and obtained cognovit judgments against defendant buyers on a purchase-money mortgage and bond and warrant in Pennsylvania. The buyers appealed from an order of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which granted the sellers' motion for summary judgment in lieu of complaint, and denied the cross motion of one of the buyers to dismiss the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgage contract provided for a confession of judgment. The sellers had received notice of the cognovit judgments and belatedly attempted to challenge them in the Pennsylvania action. The court affirmed summary judgment in favor of the sellers and held that (1) there was no bar to the trial court's consideration of the sellers' claim for full faith and credit enforcement of a foreign judgment upon the bond and warrant, (2) N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3213 authorized a motion for summary judgment in lieu of complaint, and (3) under circumstances where the parties were engaged in an arm's length business transaction, were represented by counsel, and the buyers were on actual notice of the entry of the judgments and, in fact, sought to challenge same prior to execution, the cognovit judgments did not amount to a deprivation of property rights without due process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs, who commenced this action for payment of money only alleged to be due and owing under a bond and warrant representing a second mortgage and entered into in conjunction with an agreement of sale and purchase-money mortgage related to the purchase by defendants from plaintiffs of land in Pennsylvania, and obtained cognovit judgments in Pennsylvania courts based upon the purchase-money mortgage and bond and warrant against defendants, are entitled to judgment upon this motion for summary judgment in lieu of complaint.  While the bond and warrant, insofar as it incorporated other documents related to the parties' real estate transaction, failed to set forth a liquidated sum and did not qualify as an &quot;instrument for the payment of money only&quot; (CPLR 3213), there was no bar to consideration of plaintiffs' claim for full faith and credit enforcement of a foreign judgment upon the bond and warrant.  CPLR 3213 authorizes a motion for summary judgment in lieu of complaint in an action &quot;upon an instrument for the payment of money only or upon any judgment&quot;.  That plaintiffs sought judgment on a note was set forth in their notice of motion pursuant to CPLR 3213, and while plaintiffs for the first time in their reply claimed reliance upon the Pennsylvania judgments, defendants availed themselves of an opportunity to oppose the claim in their surreply. Hence, consideration of plaintiffs' full faith and credit claim resulted in no prejudice to a substantial right of defendants.  Similarly, upon consideration of the facts, the Pennsylvania cognovit judgment on the bond and warrant should be accorded full faith and credit.  The Pennsylvania procedure at issue herein provides for the opportunity to vacate a cognovit judgment and to date, defendants have failed to do so.  Under the circumstances, where the parties were engaged in an arm's length business transaction, were represented by counsel, and the defendant was on actual notice of the judgment and, in fact, sought to challenge same prior to execution, it cannot be said that the cognovit judgment amounted to a deprivation of property rights without due process. </SPAN></P>

After appellant county's local law was found to be preempted and inconsistent with &sect; 233, but respondent county's local law was not found to be preempted and inconsistent, appellant county and appellant park operators sought review. Upon consolidating the actions, the court affirmed and reversed, holding that both local laws were preempted by and inconsistent with &sect; 233. Even though &sect; 233 lacked express language preempting the field of mobile home legislation, the court found preemption based on &sect; 233's comprehensive regulatory scheme and the variety of state laws regulating mobile homes, notwithstanding &sect; 233's reference to existing local laws.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Local laws regulating, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the eviction of mobile home owners and alienation of mobile homes are invalid since the State, by enacting Real Property Law &sect; 233, which comprehensively regulates mobile home parks, has preempted the field of mobile home park regulation. While there is no express provision in section 233 indicating a desire by the Legislature to preempt the field of mobile home legislation, it is concluded that the State intended to preempt the area by enacting a comprehensive and detailed regulatory scheme covering nearly every aspect of mobile home park life.  The enforcement provisions of the statute evidence a clear intent to provide State-wide uniformity.  Moreover, section 233 is not the only statute regulating mobile home parks and mobile homes.  The fact that the statute refers to existing local laws does not reflect a lack of preemption since the State's reference to local regulations merely establishes an adequate means of insuring that ancillary concerns such as safety, fire, and health standards are met, unobtrusive to State goals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

Overall, the local laws significantly seek to shift, in favor of the tenant, the balance established by the Legislature between owner/operator and tenant. There are numerous provisions in the local laws at issue which are identical with the State Law leading to the conclusion that the local laws, were specifically designed to inhibit the operation of the State's general laws where they differ.</SPAN></P>

In an action seeking a judgment declaring invalid local laws regulating mobile home parks, any claim by plaintiff park owner for subsequent damages arising out of an inverse condemnation allegedly resulting from the diminished value of his land has been rendered moot by the judicial declaration of the law's invalidity.  To the extent such a claim existed, plaintiff failed to raise any triable issue of fact that the enactment of the local law constituted a taking of property.  While the law requires the continuance and renewal of site leases, it made no effort to restrict rent increases and, thus, tenants were not given any economic interest in their site which could be marketed to others.  Consequently, no taking occurred.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Supreme Court of Kings County (New York), which convicted defendant of attempted murder, assault, criminal possession of a weapon, and which sentenced defendant as a second felony offender.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted murder, assault, criminal possession of a weapon, and was sentenced as a second felony offender. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that there was legally sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction, including testimony by a witness that defendant had confessed to him that defendant knew he was shooting at a police officer. The court also held that defendant was properly adjudicated a second felony offender based on a prior Canadian conviction. The court held that the trial court did not err when it looked at defendant's Canadian arrest report after determining that the Canadian crime of breaking and entering was broader than the New York crime of burglary in the third degree. The court held that because violation of the Canadian statute could take place in several different ways, the trial court properly looked at the arrest report to ascertain the specific criminal act committed by defendant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a criminal prosecution arising out of a drug &quot;buy and bust&quot; operation, the evidence was legally sufficient to support defendant's conviction of attempted murder in the second degree, assault in the first degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, where the evidence showed that a police officer, wearing his shield around his neck, entered a bar and announced that he was a police officer; that the officer was shot by an unseen gunman; that the officer was hospitalized for 14 days owing to his wounds; that a doctor stated that the officer's injuries were readily capable of causing death, and that defendant, while incarcerated, admitted to a fellow inmate that he was the gunman and that he knew he was shooting at a policeman.  Although defendant contends that the testimony of the inmate was incredible, resolution of issues of credibility, as well as the weight to be accorded to the evidence presented, are primarily questions to be determined by the finder of fact, who saw and heard the witnesses, and upon the exercise of its factual review power, the court is satisfied that the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence.  The inmate's testimony was corroborated by that of a police officer who stated that a revolver was discovered near the bar in the condition as described by defendant to the inmate, and by that of a police ballistics expert who stated that the revolver was the weapon used to shoot the officer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a criminal prosecution in which defendant was convicted of, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, attempted murder and sentenced as a second felony offender, defendant failed to preserve for appellate review on the direct appeal from his judgment of conviction his argument that the Canadian crime for which he was convicted and which served as a predicate felony for sentencing purposes did not constitute a felony in New York and that that conviction was unconstitutionally obtained.  Although defendant did raise those issues when he moved to vacate his sentence, he has waived that claim by failing to present any evidence in support of his bald statement that the prior Canadian conviction was unconstitutionally obtained (CPL 400.21 [7] [b]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Second Felony Offender -- Burden of Proof</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a criminal prosecution in which defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender, with the predicate felony being a Canadian conviction for breaking and entering with intent to commit an indictable offense therein, the court did not improperly place the burden on defendant to show, in connection with his CPL 440.20 motion, that the Canadian crime was not the equivalent of the New York crime of burglary in the third degree, since the party challenging the validity of his sentence bears the burden of coming forth with allegations sufficient to create an issue of fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Second Felony Offender -- Examination of Foreign Accusatory Instrument</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a criminal prosecution in which defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender, with the predicate felony being a Canadian conviction for breaking and entering with intent to commit an indictable offense therein, the court did not err in looking past the Canadian statute and at the defendant's Canadian arrest report, which is analogous to an accusatory instrument, once it had been determined that the Canadian crime was broader than the New York crime of burglary in the third degree, since the Canadian crime could be committed in several ways, some of which would constitute felonies in New York and others of which would constitute misdemeanors. The court was not looking at the accusatory instrument in order to expand the crime charged; rather, it was examining the essential operative allegations comprising the charge actually preferred against defendant in order to ascertain the elements of the crime of which he was convicted. Inasmuch as the Canadian arrest report indicated that defendant broke into a jewelry store and that his conviction was based on that crime, the court properly relied on that document in sentencing defendant as a second felony offender. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A child was born out of wedlock, and was turned over to adoptive parents a few days after his birth as part of a prearranged adoption.

The trial court conducted a hearing concentrated on the best interests of the child and dismissed the custody petition and directed the adoption proceeding to continue. The trial court held a reargument and affirmed its initial decision. On appeal, the court held that the natural father failed to establish that his consent was required for the adoption to proceed and that his interest in his child deserved constitutional protection because his interest was neither sufficiently prompt nor sufficiently substantial. The natural father's interest in his child was only an effort to block the adoption, but not a willingness to assume custody himself.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review the court found that under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 214-c(2), the three-year period within which an action had to be commences should have been computed from the date of the discovery of the injury by the worker or from the date when, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, such injury should have been discovered by the worker, whichever was earlier. The court held that there was no constitutional impediment to legislation that shortened a period of limitations, provided that a party had a reasonable time to have commenced the action under the shortened period. The court found that the worker had 21 months after the statute was enacted to commence suit. The court held that the supreme court erred in concluding the date the worker should have discovered his injury, holding that a determination of constructive discovery was a mixed question of law and fact. The court held that where it did not conclusively appear that the worker had knowledge the question should have been left to the trier of fact. The court held that the statutory violation cause should not have been dismissed because defendant manufacturers neither answered nor requested a bill of particulars.</SPAN></P>

The State Department of Environmental Conservation (En Con), acting upon an application for State water quality certification of four hydroelectric projects as a prerequisite to the issuance of a Federal license therefor under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 33 USC &sect; 1251 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, is solely limited to determining whether applicable water quality standards will be met in both the construction and operation of the projects; En Con is not empowered to base its decision on a balancing of the need for the project against the adverse environmental impact. Accordingly, in a proceeding to review En Con's denial of such certifications, the determinations are confirmed and the petition dismissed since such determinations were made in accordance with law, were not arbitrary and capricious, and had a rational basis where the factors listed in the letters denying petitioner's applications, i.e., &quot;turbidity and temperature change&quot;, are clearly matters affecting water quality. En Con expressed its concern to petitioner about &quot;site specific water quality impacts, i.e. temperature and summertime dissolved oxygen&quot;, as well as other technical matters, and requested that petitioner submit additional data, which requests petitioner ignored </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, ECL 17-0301; 6 NYCRR parts 701, 704).

While no administrative hearings were conducted, En Con's decision to deny the four applications, albeit without prejudice pending the receipt of additional requested data, had its impact upon petitioner at that point and was final and binding.  Other than by reapplication de novo, there was no way for petitioner to prevent or significantly ameliorate the certainty and immediacy of harm by further administrative action. En Con had actually denied the requests for the certificates, which would trigger Federal action, thereby placing petitioner's Federal license application at risk, and giving rise to an immediate, actual, and concrete injury to petitioner.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant state proposed an emergency rule extending lease succession rights to non-traditional family members of leaseholders. Plaintiff landlords of rent stabilized buildings brought a declaratory judgment action and obtained a preliminary injunction against the implementation of the rule. The injunction was extended by the New York Supreme Court to cover permanent regulations issued by the state. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the trial court erred in granting a preliminary injunction against the implementation of the state's rule. A party's entitlement to a preliminary injunction required that the party had a likelihood of success on the merits. It was unlikely that the landlords would succeed on the merits of the declaratory judgment action seeking to hold the rule expanding the definition of &quot;family&quot; invalid. The expanded definition of &quot;family,&quot; which was originally propagated by the court, had been adopted for rent controlled residences, so it was anomalous for rent stabilization rules to hold the definition was incorrect. The expanded protection of residents was desirable. The statute was not impermissibly vague because it provided information by which a person of ordinary intelligence could make a determination as to whether the residents were a &quot;family.&quot; The laws did not unconstitutionally impinge on the landlords' property rights, because it did not expand the occupancy of the residences beyond a family, so the residences were not removed form the landlords' control. Finally, the laws did not constitute a taking because occupancy was limited to the life of the family.</SPAN></P>

The regulations set out eight specified factors to be employed in determining whether a family relationship exists, and those factors are sufficiently definite to give a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to make that determination.  The question of when such a relationship commences is a relatively straightforward factual one which can be determined in terms of those aforementioned eight factors.  Aspects of the relationship from the date intermingling and joint ownership of assets began, to when the two individuals began a close relationship with each other's relatives, can be examined to determine when the &quot;family relationship&quot; truly commenced.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.

Plaintiffs' fear that the nature of the nontraditional relationship, as defined in the regulations, will permit permanent and multigenerational occupancy by strangers is unfounded since the permanency of the occupancy by the nontraditional family member is no greater than that of a traditional family member, and the definition of the relationship provided in the regulation is not so nonspecific as to allow for abuse.  Successors to a tenant's lease rights will not be mere &quot;third-parties&quot; or &quot;strangers&quot; to the tenancy. The regulations do not effectively extinguish a landlord's expectation of a reversionary interest in the apartment, since they specifically define a narrow class of individuals entitled to succession, and the occupancy in question is necessarily limited by the lifetime of the succeeding &quot;family member&quot;, which is no greater than that of any other traditional relation.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employees appealed an order of the Supreme Court, Nassau County (New York), which granted the motion for summary judgment of defendants, union and employer. The employees' action sought a judgment declaring a supplemental agreement to a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the union and the employer unconstitutional as violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supplemental agreement deleted a provision of the existing CBA that required medical center x-ray technicians to work mandatory overtime hours in exchange for a salary increase. The employees, who did not work at the medical center but at other county health centers, did not receive a similar salary increase. The employees alleged that they had equal capabilities and qualifications as the medical center technicians. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the disparity in wages paid to the two different classifications of technicians by the county was supported by a rational basis where the employer, a county, saved a substantial amount of money by the salary increase. Moreover, it was clearly established that the duties and responsibilities of the medical center technicians significantly differed from those performed by the employees. Accordingly, the challenged supplemental agreement was not constitutionally infirm. Also, the union did not violate its duty of fair representation by bargaining in good faith for the benefit for one class of its employees while being unsuccessful in its attempts to obtain the same benefit for another class of employees.</SPAN></P>

In the course of the arrest, the officers recovered two metal strips from or near defendant's person. At trial, a prosecution expert on burglar's tools could not be found. Apparently as a matter of efficient courtroom management, inasmuch as defendant had made known his wish to testify on his own behalf, the trial court directed defendant, over his counsel's objection, to proceed with his testimony without requiring the prosecution to rest. The prosecution expert was subsequently permitted to testify. The court found no error in the trial court's departure from the normal order of trial set out in N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 260.30, observing that the statutory framework delineating the order of trial did not foreclose the trial court's exercise of its common-law power to vary the order of proof in its discretion and in furtherance of justice.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant challenged a decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board (New York), which ruled that the claimant was ineligible to receive unemployment insurance benefits and charged her with a recoverable overpayment of benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant had been employed as a teacher at a religious high school. After her employment there ended, the claimant filed for and initially received unemployment insurance benefits. She was later found ineligible for benefits because she had been employed by a religious organization that was statutorily exempt from making unemployment benefit contributions. At a hearing, the claimant unsuccessfully argued that the employer exemption violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I. The court affirmed the overpayment determination, holding that N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 563(2) did not violate the Establishment Clause because it also encompassed certain nonreligious employment. Moreover, the statute did not cause excessive entanglement between the state and religious establishments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Labor Law &sect; 563 (2) (c), which excludes from unemployment insurance coverage services rendered for a nonprofit organization by a person employed at a place of religious worship as a caretaker or for the performance of duties of a religious nature, does not unconstitutionally favor religious establishments over nonreligious establishments; the purpose of enacting Labor Law &sect; 563 as a whole was to provide certain nonprofit organizations with an exemption from unemployment insurance contributions, and other nonreligious employment is encompassed within the legislation.  The actual primary effect of the statute does not unconstitutionally advance religious establishments, and although one effect of the statute permits religious organizations an exemption from paying contributions for unemployment benefits, any religious benefit is incidental. The statute's primary effect is secular, i.e., the efficient administration of the Labor Law, attained in part by maintaining the concept of the State's &quot;benevolent neutrality&quot; toward all religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Unemployment Insurance -- Benefits -- Exemption for Religious Establishments -- Lack of Excessive Entanglement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Labor Law &sect; 563 (2) (c), which excludes from unemployment insurance coverage services rendered for a nonprofit organization by a person employed at a place of religious worship as a caretaker or for the performance of duties of a religious nature, does not violate the Establishment Clause of the US Constitution, since there is no &quot;excessive entanglement&quot; between the statute and religious establishments; the State need not unconstitutionally involve itself in determining an employer's religious status to implement the statute and properly allow the exemption, since legitimate good-faith characterizations of status by the religious establishment itself are sufficient.  Moreover, without the exemption religious establishments would be exposed to increased State intervention through the collection of contributions and the attendant enforcement; therefore, the statute actually effectuates a greater separation between the State and religion. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court awarded custody of the parties' two children to appellee former husband. On review, appellant former wife contended that the proof at the trial established that she was the appropriate custodial parent and that the trial court, in weighing the parental capabilities of appellant and appellee, failed to apply gender neutral standards. The court reversed the trial court's award of custody to appellee. The court held that the weight of the evidence supported an award of custody to appellant, because there was no support for the trial court's conclusion that appellant was a &quot;remote control&quot; mother, there was no credible evidence that supported the trial court's assertion that appellant had extreme emotional problems that affected her ability to raise her children, the trial court failed to properly apply the best interests of the child standard set forth in N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent and Child -- Custody -- Sound Basis for Award</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a matrimonial action, the trial court improperly awarded custody of the parties' twin daughters to the father since the determination lacked a sound and substantial basis in the record; accordingly, upon the authority of the Appellate Division to make a determination on the record, it is concluded that the weight of the credible evidence supports an award of custody to the mother.  There is no foundation for the trial court's conclusion that the mother was a &quot;remote control&quot; parent who left the actual child rearing to the father and a housekeeper; rather, the evidence indicated that the mother participated substantially in the rearing of the children.  Moreover, there was no credible evidence that the mother has extreme emotional problems; she did not terminate treatment irresponsibly, but continued therapy.  Her problems would not affect her custodial capacity, and the court failed to consider that the father also suffered from emotional problems.  Accordingly, the custody determination did not have the firm expert confirmation upon which it claims to have relied to justify the result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent and Child -- Custody -- Evidence of Mother's Relationship with Another Man</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a matrimonial action, the trial court improperly awarded custody of the parties' twin daughters to the father; the court allowed extensive testimony regarding a relationship between the mother and &quot;her lover&quot;, concluding that it disserved the children by disordering the mother's priorities.  However, the evidence does not justify the conclusion that the mother's alleged relationship resulted in her absenting herself from the children when they were in stress; rather, the evidence indicated that while the children were aware of the parties' problems, they were well adjusted emotionally.  There was no credible proof that the mother's alleged relationship with another man affected the children in any significant way; the sexual behavior of a litigant in a custody dispute is only relevant if and to the extent that the children are thereby affected.  Moreover, when the mother's attorney tried to question the parties' housekeeper and crossexamine the father about parallel activities on his part, the court improperly found the questions objectionable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent and Child -- Custody -- Gender-Neutral Standards</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There is no prima facie right to the custody of a child </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Domestic Relations Law &sect;&sect; 70, 240), and the role of gender in making custody determinations has no place in current law; accordingly, in a custody dispute the trial court improperly imposed a more rigorous standard upon plaintiff wife with regard to employment outside the home, and by not imposing a corresponding standard upon the husband, the court was not free of the appearance of having imposed a more onerous burden on the wife.  A wife who is employed should not suffer in her chances for custody any more than should the husband, and a custody-seeking mother who works outside the home should not be penalized for her employment, by being characterized as undevoted to her child, any more than should the father.  Custody determinations should not be based on any unfounded assumption that a &quot;working mother&quot; is a less satisfactory parent or any less fully committed to the care of the child than is a &quot;working father&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent and Child -- Custody -- Psychiatric Evaluations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  In a custody dispute, the trial court improperly awarded custody of the parties' twin daughters to defendant father; the court set forth no convincing reasons for discounting the court-requested psychiatric evaluation of all family members, as well as the evaluation by the county Probation Department, recommending that the mother be granted custody. A review of the record leads to the conclusion that the mother would better advance the emotional and intellectual development of the children in the long run and that she would better promote familial harmony, since she would be less likely to continue an ongoing competition with her former spouse or attempt to alienate the children from him.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandparents saw and visited their grandson during the first few months of his life, after which the parents denied them any contact. The court reversed the order awarding the grandparents visitation. The grandparents had no common law or constitutional right to visitation with their grandson. Although the grandparents could seek visitation under &sect; 72, they could only be awarded visitation if they established that their established relationship with the child was disrupted because of a change in the status of the nuclear family (divorce of the parents), interference with a derivative right of visitation that arose after the death of one of the child's parents, or abdication of parental responsibility.

Grandparents enjoy no common-law or constitutional right to visit with their grandchildren, and a petition for an order authorizing visitation pursuant to Domestic Relations Law &sect; 72, which provides for grandparent visitation, must demonstrate the existence of some circumstance or condition, such as untoward disruption of an established grandparent-grandchild relationship because of, e.g., a change in the status of the nuclear family, or interference with a &quot;derivative&quot; right, or some abdication of parental responsibility, before judicial examination of the best interests of the child with its attendant trauma, increased animosity, and financial drain is to be undertaken. The State may not interfere in family life to the extent sought; petitioners' status as grandparents and their love and affection are an insufficient premise for judicial scrutiny. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment convicting him of rape, sodomy, sexual abuse, incest, and endangering the welfare of a child, upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence. Defendant contended that the use of live, two-way, closed-circuit television for the child witnesses violated his constitutional right to confrontation. U.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV; N.Y. Const. art. VI. The court on review found N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law article 65 to be facially constitutional. The court additionally found no violations to defendant's right to confrontation in the application of the procedures set forth in N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law art. 65. Expert testimony was clear and convincing in establishing that five of the 12 factors set forth in N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 65.20(9) were established. Most importantly, the expert gave a detailed opinion of the psychological harm that the children would likely suffer if they were required to testify in open court. The trial court was justified in concluding that there were extraordinary circumstances present to justify the use of the closed-circuit television for the children's testimony.</SPAN></P>

There was clear and convincing evidence that the child witnesses were vulnerable and likely to suffer severe emotional harm if compelled to testify in the presence of defendant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a voluntary association of enrolled agents authorized to represent clients in tax disputes and one of its clients, appealed the decision of the Supreme Court (New York), which granted the cross-motion of defendant, New York State Division of Tax Appeals, for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voluntary association of enrolled agents authorized to represent clients in tax disputes and one of its clients (association) brought an action for a judgment declaring N.Y.

The lower court found that the association failed to meet its heavy burden of proving that &sect; 2014 was unconstitutional either as an invalid exercise of the state's police power or as violative of equal protection. The court concluded that, giving &sect; 2014 the presumption of validity to which it was entitled, there was a reasonable connection between the decision to exclude enrolled agents from being retained by taxpayers in state tax proceedings and the promotion of the welfare of society. The court also concluded that the statutory classification met the rational basis test because the state had a legitimate interest in limiting the classes of professionals who could represent clients in state tax disputes to those over whom the state could exercise regulatory and disciplinary control. The court remitted the matter for the entry of a judgment declaring &sect; 2014 constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Tax Law &sect; 2014, which eliminated the right of enrolled agents, i.e., persons authorized by the United States Department of the Treasury to represent clients before the United States Internal Revenue Service, to represent clients on State tax appeals, is not an unconstitutional exercise of the State's police power, since the Legislature, when it overhauled the tax dispute adjudicatory process in order to remove any perception of bias, presumably recognized the need in State tax disputes to limit representation of taxpayers to professionals who are licensed by the State, i.e., attorneys and public accountants, and over whom the State could exercise regulatory power to achieve the legitimate objective of effective representation of taxpayers by competent professionals; moreover, nowhere in the Federal regulations is there any indication that licensing by the Treasury Department precludes the individual States from establishing different requirements for those who may be retained by taxpayers in State administrative or quasi-judicial proceedings.  In light of the presumption of validity enjoyed by the statute, there is a reasonable connection between the elimination of representation by enrolled agents and the promotion of the welfare of society.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Tax Law &sect; 2014, which eliminated the right of enrolled agents, i.e., persons authorized by the United States Department of the Treasury to represent clients before the United States Internal Revenue Service, to represent clients on State tax appeals, is not an unconstitutional denial of equal protection; inasmuch as neither a fundamental right nor a suspect classification is in issue, the enrolled agents' equal protection claim need not be subjected to strict judicial scrutiny, but is to be measured by the &quot;reasonable basis&quot; test, which merely requires the governmental classification to bear a fair and substantial relation to some conceivable and legitimate State interest.  Accordingly, in light of the State's legitimate interest in limiting the class of professionals who may represent clients in State tax disputes to those over whom it may exercise regulatory and disciplinary control, i.e., attorneys and public accountants, the limitation promotes and encourages a high level of professional competence in tax proceedings and, thereby, protects taxpayers in quasi-judicial administrative proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Tax Law &sect; 2014, which eliminated the right of enrolled agents, i.e., persons authorized by the United States Department of the Treasury to represent clients before the United States Internal Revenue Service, to represent clients on State tax appeals, is not an unconstitutional impairment of a taxpayer/client's right to contract, since the State's interest in ensuring adequate and effective retained representation of taxpayers in State tax matters is an important public purpose; the legislation enacted to serve that objective may not be stricken as unconstitutional even though the method of accomplishing the State's purpose may impair the right to contract or abridge existing contract rights, since the State policy may override private contract rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff telephone service customer commenced an action against defendant telephone company for reimbursement of taxes collected on &quot;end user common line&quot; charges, contending that the charges were interstate in nature and exempt from sales tax. The trial court denied plaintiff's motion for class certification, granted defendant's cross motion for summary judgment, and dismissed the complaint in its entirety on the merits. The trial court dismissed plaintiff's claim based on the State Tax Commission's formal advisory opinion, upon which defendant relied, finding that it correctly mandated the collection of sales tax on &quot;end user common line&quot; charges as a matter of law. On appeal, the court affirmed the order. Defendant was designated by law to collect the taxes and as such it had no right to question the underlying validity of the tax. The claim that defendant's collection of sales taxes was improper, unnecessary, unauthorized by law, and an unjust enrichment, were claims that had to be raised in an administrative proceeding against the taxing body.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In four proceedings in different county trial courts, the judges sought an order declaring that the disparity between their wages and the wages paid to the City Court judges of the cities of Yonkers and Utica pursuant to N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 221-i violated their rights to equal protection of the laws under N.Y. Const. art I, &sect; 11 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. They requested an award of back pay, related ancillary relief, and counsel fees. In all of the actions, the trial courts found in favor the judges. On appeal, the court held that the state did not met its burden of establishing that a rational basis existed for the disparity in salaries between the judges and the Utica City Court Judges. The court found that the disparate treatment was unjustified since there was a true unity of judicial interest indistinguishable by separate geographic considerations. However, the court found that in comparing the information in the record contrasting the situations of the judges and their Yonkers counterparts, the state's contention that a rational basis existed for the salary disparity was sufficiently supported.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgements in favor the judges were modified where they provided for prejudgment interest.

An examination of the data shows that a rational relationship has been established between higher New York City area salaries and the State's objective of ensuring that the limited resources available for courts are allocated according to need and utilized effectively.  Although plaintiffs dispute the accuracy of the State's data, they have failed to provide alternative information.  Moreover, since plaintiffs' courts are all located in upstate counties within the Fourth Judicial Department, and the City of Yonkers is located in the Second Judicial Department, it cannot easily be concluded that a true unity of judicial interest has been established.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, inasmuch as plaintiffs have successfully contended that they have been denied their right to equal protection, a claim cognizable under 42 USC &sect; 1983, the actions must be remitted to the respective Supreme Courts so as to allow defendants an opportunity to demonstrate whether special circumstances exist which would bar an award of counsel fees.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff historical foundation appealed an order from the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), which granted defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint seeking to enjoin the county's demolition of houses without compliance with a city ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff historic foundation brought this action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent defendant county from proceeding with its plan to demolish a county-owned block of houses without first complying with the provisions of the city's Historic Resources Commission Ordinance, Code of City of Albany &sect;&sect; 1-126 - 1-136. The complaint was dismissed on the ground that the ordinance violated the constitutional prohibitions against the taking of private property without just compensation in N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. Historic district and landmark preservation legislation commonly regulated and restricted demolition of buildings in protected districts, and had been authoritatively upheld against constitutional attacks under the Takings Clause. Dismissal of the complaint was reversed because defendant had shown nothing more than that it might be subjected to some as yet unknown expense of new development before it could demolish the property if Code of City of Albany &sect; 1-135 (b)(2) was enforced and, this alone was insufficient to establish a taking without just compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Dismissal of plaintiff's complaint seeking injunctive and declarative relief to prevent the county from demolishing houses was reversed because the historical preservation ordinance was not unconstitutional as the trial court did not have the proper facts before it to properly construe the statute and its application to the facts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Historic Preservation District -- Constitutionality of Ordinance Regulating Demolition of Buildings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Inasmuch as historic district and/or landmark preservation legislation commonly regulates demolition of buildings in protected districts and has been authoritatively upheld against constitutional attacks under the &quot;takings&quot; clause, a provision of a municipal ordinance keying demolition to a showing either that the building in question is not of historical, archeological or aesthetic value, or that its owner will suffer hardship by being required to repair or maintain property incapable of yielding a reasonable return, is constitutionally valid since it virtually replicates regulatory framework which has sustained constitutional attack.  In light of the fact that Supreme Court determined that the subject ordinance was unconstitutional on the basis of a separate provision governing new development, and the fact that the ordinance contains a severability clause, plaintiffs, which seek to bar defendants, who concededly never complied with the provision in question, from demolishing a building until they have complied with the ordinance, are entitled to an injunction restraining the demolition until defendants have complied with the valid and unchallenged portion of the ordinance which remained unaffected by Supreme Court's ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Historic Preservation District -- Constitutionality of Ordinance Regulating Demolition of Buildings -- Showing of Economic Hardship</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action to prevent defendants, the owners of a historic building, from demolishing the building until they have complied with the strictures of a municipal ordinance regulating the demolition of historic structures, Supreme Court's determination that a portion of the ordinance which required owners of historic buildings to have plans for the new development of the site approved by a municipal commission prior to demolishing the building is unconstitutional, was error where defendants never demonstrated the economic impact of complying with the ordinance; consequently, the court did not have specific facts before it to determine whether the restrictions imposed on defendants' right to demolish were so severe as to amount to a &quot;taking&quot;.  Moreover, defendants did not even attempt to demonstrate that the requirement in question was not reasonably necessary to effectuate the clearly legitimate purposes of the legislation; indeed, permitting demolition without assurance that there will be some form of development would create a risk of the site becoming overgrown and decayed, a result antithetical to the aesthetic purposes of the ordinance. The requirement in question substantially advances the legitimate municipal purpose underlying the legislation, and there is a direct nexus between the requirement and the purposes underlying the restrictions on demolition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In an action to prevent defendants, the owners of a historic building, from demolishing the building until they have complied with the strictures of a municipal ordinance regulating the demolition of historic structures, defendants have failed to show that the requirement of submission and approval of a suitable plan of new development as a condition for permitting demolition deprives them of all economically viable use of the subject property; restricting the right to demolish, which is only one strand in an owner's bundle of property rights, may diminish the value of the property or prevent its most profitable use, but those do not constitute a &quot;taking&quot; in terms of impact upon the property as a whole.  Moreover, the ordinance contains provisions for administrative waiver of its provisions and defendants have failed to avail themselves of seeking such relief, thereby obviating their constitutional objections.  Defendants have merely alleged that they will be subject to an unknown expense, and that is insufficient to establish an unconstitutional &quot;taking&quot;.  Accordingly, summary judgment should be granted to plaintiffs, and the various factual issues raised should be resolved in a proceeding before the municipal commission established by the ordinance. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorney appealed a judgment from the Supreme Court of Rensselaer County (New York) that dismissed the attorney's action to compel respondent county to pay his assigned counsel fees and expenses awarded by order of the County Court of Rensselaer County, under N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was appointed to serve as counsel to an indigent defendant in a criminal action in the County Court of Rensselaer County.

Thereafter, the county sought review of the excess compensation by the presiding justice of the court, under rule 822.4. The administrative action was stayed and the attorney brought a combined N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding and declaratory judgment action to compel payment and to have rule 822.4 declared invalid. The supreme court dismissed the action for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. On appeal, the court ruled that the attorney was not required to exhaust his administrative remedies because the attorney had challenged, on constitutional grounds, the presiding justice's authority under rule 822.4 to administratively review the attorney's award of fees. Moreover, the court ruled, rule 822.4 was invalid insofar as it pertained to applications under &sect; 722-b, because there was no valid delegation of the authority to the presiding justice to review such fee awards.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a proceeding seeking an order compelling payment of the compensation awarded by a County Court to an attorney who acted as assigned counsel for a criminal defendant, and a declaration that 22 NYCRR 822.4, which provides for review by the Presiding Justice of the Appellate Division, Third Department, of fees in excess of the limits contained in County Law &sect; 722-b, is in irreconcilable conflict with section 722-b, which provides for compensation of assigned counsel, petitioner was not required to exhaust his administrative remedies as a prerequisite to legal action, since petitioner has challenged the very authority of the Presiding Justice to administratively review the award of counsel fees, asserting that the court rule is unconstitutional and illegal.  Moreover, it cannot be seriously argued that the rule does not conflict with the statute, inasmuch as it affords respondent county officials an avenue of administrative review not provided for in the statute; thus, the rule, inconsistent with the general State-wide procedure provided by the County Law, must yield to the statute, unless the State Constitution provides authority for its promulgation.</SPAN></P>

The rule was not continued in effect as a rule of the Chief Administrator by virtue of the savings provision of 22 NYCRR 103.1, since 22 NYCRR 822.4 was not in effect in its present form when 22 NYCRR 103.1 was promulgated, and, thus, could not have been included in the adoption provision of 22 NYCRR 103.1.  </SPAN></P>

It was not the intent of the State Legislature that the tax proceeds be used for such general municipal purposes as the construction, maintenance and repair of firehouses or other fire equipment; rather, the legislation is clear that the tax proceeds must be expended solely for the personal benefit of the fire department members.  The local legislation need not be reviewed in the context of two time frames, i.e., before and after recent amendments to the two statutes, since the intent of the Legislature did not change and the amendments were merely procedural clarifications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court in New York County (New York) denied a motion by plaintiff city for summary judgment declaring 1989 N.Y. Laws ch. 773, as amended by 1990 Laws ch. 17, unconstitutional, and granted a cross motion by defendant state for summary judgment declaring the law constitutional. The law provided for a referendum for the voters of one borough to vote on secession from the city. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The law was designed primarily to inform the legislature as to the extent of secessionist sentiment in the borough and the manner in which the residents would have governed themselves if permitted to do so; not the least concern was shown for public sentiment in the other four boroughs. Rejecting the ripeness argument, the court determined that to say that this issue was not ripe was like saying that events were not ripe in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina, in April 1861. The court added that a question of equal protection was raised: why should only one borough have been given the franchise to stop secession? Affirming the decision, the court answered that while the residents of the other four boroughs would have felt an impact, the effect upon the borough seceding was of a significantly more substantial and direct character. Only they would have been subject to the general governmental powers of the new government. The court held that this, and the state's apparent interest in facilitating that community's self-determination, amply justified a classification that prevented the residents of the other four communities from exercising a veto power over secession.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the suit brought by the city against the state requesting that the law permitting one borough to vote on the idea of secession be ruled unconstitutional, the court affirmed the grant of summary judgment declaring the law constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action seeking a declaration as to the constitutionality of Laws of 1989 (ch 773), which set forth a process by which the Borough of Staten Island may be separated from the City of New York and established as a new city, the issue of whether the State can carve a new city out of the territory of one already existing without a home rule message from the already existing city is ripe for determination since the legislation in question, which authorizes a series of referenda upon which only residents of Staten Island may vote, is not purely advisory in nature: it is only in the event of affirmative votes that further legislation will be required to effect a secession, and a negative vote in either referendum will stop the process cold. Staten Islanders are thereby given a veto power over secession denied the residents of the other New York City boroughs; the question of why should Staten Islanders be given the franchise to stop secession and other New Yorkers not, raises a question of equal protection ripe for adjudication.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Laws of 1989 (ch 773), which provide a process by which the Borough of Staten Island may be separated from the City of New York and established as a new city, and which provide that only residents of Staten Island may vote on a series of referenda pertaining to secession, is not unconstitutional; although the legislation makes no provision for a home rule message from the City of New York (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2 [b] [2]), the State is free to legislate matters of municipal boundaries unfettered by home rule constraints (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2 [a]; art X, &sect; 1), since legislation dealing with matters of State concern, albeit of localized application and having a direct effect on the most basic of local interests, does not violate the Constitution's home rule provisions.</SPAN></P>

Laws of 1989 (ch 773), which provide a process by which the Borough of Staten Island may be separated from the City of New York and established as a new city, and which provide that only residents of Staten Island may vote on a series of referenda pertaining to secession, is not unconstitutional; in a &quot;single-shot&quot; referendum, if the classification between those who are specially interested and those who are not is reasonably precise, the latter class may be validly excluded from the franchise where the issue to be submitted will have a disproportionate impact on an identifiable group of voters. Given the extraordinarily wide latitude that States have in the creation of various types of political subdivisions, the State can legitimately adopt a geographic classification based upon the boundaries of a proposed new political subdivision to be created if approved by the electorate of the smaller, albeit significant, separating community.  Although the residents of the other boroughs of New York City would bear an impact from the proposed separation, the impact upon Staten Islanders would be significantly more substantial and direct; accordingly, that disparate impact and the State's interest in facilitating that community's self-determination, justify a classification that prevents the residents of the other boroughs from exercising a veto power over the question of secession. The interests of the residents of the other boroughs are adequately represented by their State legislators.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both plaintiffs and defendant drug manufacturers challenged an order from the Supreme Court, Greene County (New York), which granted motions dismissing certain claims, including those for emotional distress and plaintiff spouse's loss of consortium action. A motion by defendants to preclude application of collateral estoppel against them was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged that her exposure to the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) while she was in utero caused abnormalities in her reproductive system, which resulted in a hysterectomy. She brought an action for damages against a number of defendant manufacturers. Plaintiff's husband asserted a loss of consortium claim because plaintiff was infertile. The lower court dismissed the husband's claim and held that collateral estoppel did not apply. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the loss of childbearing opportunity, standing alone and unconnected to any other injury to the marital relationship, was not an element of loss of consortium. Moreover, the revival provision of the toxic tort statute did not create a cause of action where none otherwise existed. Collateral estoppel was inapplicable in this case because plaintiff's mother ingested DES in 1950, and the time difference from that in Bichler v. Lilly &amp; Co., 55 N.Y.2d 571 (1982) related to a difference in the foreseeability issues.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, not only did the allegedly actionable conduct not occur during the marriage, loss of the ability to have natural children is not an element of loss of consortium, which includes such elements as love, companionship, society, sexual relations and solace, none of which was particularly pleaded by plaintiff's husband.</SPAN></P>

It found that the terms of the stipulation did not exceed the town's constitutional or statutory authority, nor were they contrary to public policy. The town's option to purchase the land, the court found, did not constitute an improper delegation of the town's authority to settle claims because the stipulation contained a procedure by which the fair market value could be determined for the land. It further found that the parking lot arrangement did not constitute an unconstitutional pledge of the town's credit or a town undertaking for a private purpose because the town properly exercised its governmental function in agreeing to provide more parking facilities given the traffic problems attendant to inadequate parking facilities.</SPAN></P>

Instead, the court noted that the evidence demonstrated that even a small amount of heroin could have been potentially dangerous to the user and to others, and that its presence in a facility which housed large numbers of prisoners who were known to have used the drug could have resulted in disruptive and dangerous behavior among the inmates. In addition, the court held that N.Y.

This court affirmed and rejected all of the former licensee's arguments. First, the former licensee's license to act as a wholesaler and stamping agent created no vested right, but was merely a privilege extended by the state subject to alteration by the imposition of reasonable restrictions. The legislative determination to condition relicensing on the absence of a criminal conviction for violating the cigarette tax laws was reasonable. Second, the amendments were not retroactive when made to apply to future transactions, merely because such transactions related to and were founded upon antecedent events. Third, there was no due process violation because the former licensee had no vested right in its license and the amendments were intended for legitimate public purposes such as increased competition in the industry and enhanced cigarette tax receipts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner possessed an undeveloped parcel of realty abutting a creek. Soon after the owner had obtained conditional preliminary subdivision approval from the town, the state legislature imposed a moratorium on development along the creek in order to study the area for possible inclusion in the state's Wild, Scenic and Recreational Rivers System Act. The moratorium was to expire in five years or when the creek was added to the state's wild, scenic and recreational rivers system, whichever occurred first. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the owner failed to file a complete application to the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (EC) for a permit exempting him from the moratorium and thus, there still had been no decision rendered by the EC. The court held that by first resorting to the courts instead of exhausting available administrative remedies, the owner had acted prematurely and was not entitled to any relief.</SPAN></P>

Published rules and regulations, as well as decisions of the State Tax Commission were available to her. The reversal of a prior stipulation was of no consequence to the taxpayer because it was only binding in the earlier proceeding and could have no effect on the current proceeding. Further, there was no evidence that two members of the tribunal were prejudiced by the taxpayer's previous disputes with the Commission. The Legislature's repeal of former N.Y. Tax Law art. 23 was not a recognition by the Legislature that the law was unconstitutional. The fact that different occupations were afforded different tax treatment under former art. 23 did not constitute the invidious discrimination prohibited by the Equal Protection Clauses of the Federal or State Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner was entitled to other employee benefits during the period he was on nonpay status for an extended sick leave, and those benefits would have terminated upon his discharge; moreover, once petitioner was terminated, his rights to reinstatement were much more limited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff lessor appealed from an order and judgment of the Supreme Court in New York County (New York), which granted a cross motion by defendant lessee for summary judgment, dismissing plaintiff's complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that it was not required to offer renewal leases to defendant, as a not-for-profit hospital and a named tenant, under the rent stabilization laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lessee was a not-for-profit hospital that subleased its apartments to its nurses and wanted to take advantage of the rent stabilization laws, which provided that defendant was exempt from the primary residence requirement.

Plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of a statute which amended existing law and specifically provided an exception to the nonprimary residence exemption in the rent stabilization law where a not-for-profit hospital was the lease's named tenant. The lower court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment because defendant, as not-for-profit hospital, was the tenant that was to be protected by the corrective legislative amendment. Plaintiff appealed the judgment. The court reversed, holding that rent stabilization, as applied to defendant, constituted a taking because it granted a perpetual tenancy to defendant due to the fact that defendant would always exist and be able to fulfill vacancies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Rent Regulation -- Renewal Lease -- Not-for-Profit Hospital</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A not-for-profit hospital, which is the named tenant on expired leases for rent-stabilized apartments in a building converted to condominium ownership, is not entitled to renewal leases for the subject apartments pursuant to Laws of 1984 (ch 940), which amended the Rent Stabilization Law to provide that such hospitals are entitled to renewal leases where they sublet the apartments to &quot;affiliated&quot; personnel (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 26-504 [a] [1] [f]) and permitted such subletting without the consent of the landlord, since the statute constitutes an unconstitutional taking of the landlord's property; however, inasmuch as statutes should be interpreted to harmonize with the Constitution, chapter 940 shall be interpreted as requiring the landlord to offer a renewal lease to those hospital employees who occupied the subject apartments as a primary residence at the expiration of the previous leases. Such an interpretation results in the continued occupancy of those apartments by persons occupying them as their primary residence for as long as they continue to do so, and inasmuch as the renewal lease is offered to persons, rather than to the hospital, an institution with a virtually limitless existence, the landlord has a reasonable expectation of a vacancy at some point, whereupon it may exercise the prerogatives of ownership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Notification of Attorney-General -- Role of Court</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action challenging the constitutionality of Laws of 1984 (ch 940), the lower court erred in not considering plaintiff's argument on the ground that the Attorney-General had not been notified that the constitutionality of a statute was in issue, since both CPLR 1012 (b) and Executive Law &sect; 71 require that it is the responsibility of the court, and not the parties, to give such notice; that the court failed to so notify the Attorney-General or direct plaintiff to do so poses no obstacle to appellate review, since the Attorney-General has been notified that the issue is being raised on appeal and served with a copy of plaintiff-appellant's brief.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Laws of 1984 (ch 940), which amended the Rent Stabilization Law to provide that not-for-profit hospitals are entitled to renewal leases where they sublet rent-stabilized apartments to &quot;affiliated&quot; personnel (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 26-504 [a] [1] [f]) and permitted such subletting without the consent of the landlord, is an unconstitutional taking of the landlord's property since it results in the permanent physical occupation of apartments leased to the hospital by transferring the landlord's reversionary interest in all the apartments covered by the leases to the hospital, the existence of which is, to all intents and purposes, perpetual; thus, the landlord is effectively precluded from regaining possession of its property.  Moreover, inasmuch as the apartments have been converted to condominium ownership, the landlord has also been deprived of the opportunity to sell the apartments free and clear of tenancies since the perpetual existence of the hospital means that no vacancies will ever occur.  Although the hospital must sublet the apartments to employees who must use them as their primary residence, that requirement merely places a minimal restriction on the hospital's indefeasible right to possession.</SPAN></P>

By requiring a landlord to offer renewal leases to an institution whose existence is for all practical purposes perpetual, chapter 940 would increase the dislocation of long-term tenants, thereby contravening the purpose of rent stabilization, viz., to protect residential tenants and their families during an acute housing shortage; dislocation would be increased by requiring the hospital to remove long-term occupants if they terminate their employment with it.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, the Rent Stabilization Law was enacted to ameliorate a declared housing emergency, not to further a policy of promoting better health care, and it is difficult to accept the notion that the availability of the 39 apartments in issue alleviates a health care emergency to any discernible degree.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, engaged in the business of collecting and hauling of wastes, appealed the decision of the Supreme Court in St. Lawrence County (New York), which converted a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 into an action for declaratory judgment and granted defendants' motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff had been denied exceptions related to processing of recyclable materials by the St. Lawrence County Solid Waste Disposal Authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, engaged in the business of collecting and hauling recyclable materials, was denied certain exceptions to the standards adopted by the county waste disposal authority. Plaintiff commenced an action seeking to invalidate the authority's resolutions and to invalidate the local law creating the authority. The trial court converted the action to a declaratory judgment action and granted summary judgment for defendants, county and authority. Plaintiff appealed. The court stated that county local laws were entitled to a presumption of constitutionality and that administrative standards were considered legitimate as long within the delegated authority of the administrative body. The court held that the delegation of power to the authority was not improper, that standards developed by the authority were within the legislatively delegated mandate, and that their exercise had been neither arbitrary nor capricious. The judgment of the lower court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Recognizing the presumption of constitutionality of legislative enactments and the delegation of power to the administrative body, the court held that the delegation of power to the authority was not improper, that the standard for granting exceptions was within the authority's powers, and that the authority's actions were neither arbitrary nor capricious. The court affirmed the ruling of the lower court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Authorities -- Solid Waste Disposal Authority -- Delegation by County of Powers to Solid Waste Disposal Authority</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The enactment by a county of a law providing that all solid waste generated within the county be delivered to a solid waste management facility within the county, and that the solid waste disposal authority charged with operating the facility could make exceptions to the aforementioned delivery requirement &quot;as it from time to time may determine to be in the public interest&quot; was not invalid; the penultimate sentence of Public Authorities Law &sect; 2048-s provided express authority for the county's adoption of the challenged law, and the county does not lack the power to grant exceptions.  In view of the close nexus of the authority to the county </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Public Authorities Law &sect; 2048-c [1], [5], [6] [b]; &sect; 2048-g) and broad powers in waste management matters </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Public Authorities Law &sect; 2048-e [4], [5], [7]), the county's delegation of the power to grant exceptions to the authority was not an improper subdelegation of powers; rather, there has been a delegation to a body most capable of effectively performing the task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Authorities -- Solid Waste Disposal Authority -- &quot;Public Interest&quot; Standard for Granting Exceptions from Waste Delivery Requirements</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The enactment by a county of a law providing that all solid waste generated within the county be delivered to a solid waste management facility within the county, and that the solid waste disposal authority charged with operating the facility could make exceptions to the aforementioned delivery requirement &quot;as it from time to time may determine to be in the public interest&quot; was not invalid, and the &quot;public interest&quot; standard for granting exceptions from waste delivery requirements is not inadequate; inasmuch as the public interest standard is directly related to and limited by the general purposes of Public Authorities Law title 13-E, the enabling legislation pursuant to which the authority was established, and the policy expressed in ECL 27-0101, there is a sufficient framework to establish the parameters for agency action. In view of the complexities involved in the field of solid waste management, the standard is prescribed in as much detail as is reasonably practicable; accordingly, the public interest standard is adequate to channel the exercise of the authority's power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Authorities -- Solid Waste Disposal Authority -- Discretionary Denial of Request that Not All Waste be Delivered to Facility Operated by Authority</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The decision by a solid waste disposal authority to deny a request by a refuse hauler for an exception to a local law requiring all solid waste generated within the county serviced by the authority to be delivered to a facility operated by the authority was not irrational and is upheld; inasmuch as the decision was an exercise of discretion, specific findings of fact were not required.  The authority made a reasoned decision since it thoroughly evaluated plaintiff's request, including their environmental and economic effects, before reaching its determination, and denied only so much of the request as failed to document the hauler's ability to successfully recycle the materials it sought not to deliver to the facility; by granting a generic exception, the authority effectively granted some of the hauler's requests (e.g., with respect to paper, glass and cans) and at the same time provided recycling opportunities to the private sector on a broader, more equitable basis.  Moreover, the authority is maximizing resource recovery by committing to pursue a goal of recycling 40% of the county's waste by 1997 and by promoting the recovery of thermal and electrical energy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, ECL 27-0701 [4]; Public Authorities Law &sect; 2048-b [11]; the authority attempted to balance the county's need for short-term and long-term solid waste disposal management in conformity with State policy of resource recovery and the encouragement of recycling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Monopolies -- Solid Waste Disposal Authority -- Restraints of Competition -- State Policy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A local law which requires all solid waste generated within a county to be delivered to a solid waste management facility operated by a county authority does not violate General Business Law &sect; 340, which prohibits arrangements in restraint of competition; even assuming that a legislative act of the county could be considered a contract, agreement or arrangement within the purview of section 340, Public Authorities Law &sect; 2048-s, which allows reasonable restraints and which is part of the authority's enabling legislation, superseded the provisions of section 340&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Public Authorities Law &sect; 2048-w).  Moreover, because of the State enabling legislation, there is an exception from the Federal antitrust laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Environmental Conservation -- Solid Waste Management Facility -- Recyclable Material</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In a proceeding in which a refuse hauler challenged a county law requiring all solid waste generated within the county to be delivered to a solid waste management facility operated by a county authority, plaintiff's contention that recyclable material is not solid waste </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Public Authorities Law &sect; 2048-b [13]) does not present a real controversy because plaintiff has not identified the specific types of recyclable material which it contemplated purchasing or hauling; the issue is nonjusticiable since plaintiff has not sought adjudication of any specific dispute and there is no present prejudice to plaintiff.  In any event, recyclable materials are included within the definition of &quot;solid waste&quot;, but are segregated from the waste stream by means of &quot;source separation&quot; or &quot;resource recovery&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Public Authorities Law &sect; 2048-b [11], [16]).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Supreme Court (New York), which convicted defendant of sodomy, sexual abuse, and endangering the welfare of a child. Defendant contended that the court's employment of the procedures authorized under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 65, which permits the taking of the testimony of a child witness through the use of a live, two-way closed-circuit television, had been improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sodomy and sexual abuse involving two young children. On appeal, defendant challenged the court's employment of the procedures authorized under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 65, which permits the taking of the testimony of a child witness through the use of live, two-way closed circuit television. The trial court permitted the two children to testify through the use of such a system based on a social worker's testimony that the children would benefit from the use of such a system because of what had happened to them and because they were fearful of defendant. On appeal, the conviction was reversed and a new trial ordered because the court found that defendant had been deprived of her U.S. Const. amend. VI right to confrontation by virtue of the manner in which &sect; 65 was applied. The court concluded that the trial court's finding of vulnerability with respect to the children was not supported by the record because no evidence had been established that the children would have suffered severe mental or emotional harm if they had been required to testify without the closed-circuit system.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was reversed and remanded for new trial because the children witnesses were allowed to testify via closed-circuit television despite the absence of a showing of exceptional vulnerability.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a sex crimes prosecution involving child victim witnesses, CPL article 65, which permits the taking of the testimony of a child witness through the use of live two-way closed-circuit television in certain circumstances, was applied in such a manner as to result in a deprivation of defendant's right to confrontation under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 6, since the finding of the trial court that the two child victim witnesses were &quot;vulnerable&quot; within the meaning of CPL 65.10 (1); 65.20, which provide that a &quot;vulnerable&quot; child witness is one who will suffer severe mental or emotional harm if required to testify at a criminal proceeding in the same room with defendant, is not supported by the record; in making its finding of vulnerability, the court relied primarily on the testimony of a social worker who was of the opinion that all child witnesses in sexual abuse cases are &quot;vulnerable&quot;.  The testimony of the social worker lacked anything that would indicate why the two children in the instant case would suffer severe and emotional harm if forced to testify in open court; there is nothing extraordinary in the instant case which would warrant making an exception to the irreducible literal meaning of the Confrontation Clause.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. CPL article 65, which permits the taking of the testimony of a child witness through the use of live, two-way closed-circuit television in certain circumstances, is not facially violative of a criminal defendant's right to confrontation (U.S. Const 6th, 14th Amends; NY Const, art I, &sect; 6), since it contains sufficient safeguards to prevent the use of indiscriminate televised testimony; neither the State nor the Federal Constitution provides a defendant with the absolute right to total eye-to-eye confrontation in the defendant's physical presence, and where an appropriate individualized showing of necessity is made (e.g., that the child will suffer severe emotional harm if forced to testify in open court) and the infringement on the defendant's confrontation rights is kept to a minimum, the use of closed-circuit television technology is not constitutionally prescribed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner filed an action pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 against defendant town in the Supreme Court, Orange County (New York), which was converted to an action for a declaratory judgment with respect to Greenville, N.Y., Local Law No. 2 (1987).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town's building and fire inspectors determined that the storage of tires on the property represented a fire and health hazard so the town's board notified the owner that his property was a &quot;dangerous property&quot; that had to be made safe within 60 days. The plaintiff acknowledged receiving the notice but did not attend the public hearing. Following the hearing, the board directed the building inspector to prepare contingency plans for a cleanup of the property in the event that the owner did not comply with the notice. The owner argued on appeal that the procedures in Local Law No. 2 deprived him of due process and that the law was invalid. The trial court held that the record established that the board's action was not arbitrary or capricious. The court held that: (1) because statutes were presumptively valid, the owner had the burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of the local law beyond a reasonable doubt, which he did not do; (2) the law was a valid exercise of the town's authority to regulate unsafe properties; and (3) the law provided notice and an opportunity to be heard before the town took any direct action, which was all that due process required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner made applications for a variance with regard to frontage requirements under the ordinance.  N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceedings followed the denial of each application. Both proceedings were dismissed, with the second being dismissed based on the res judicata effect of the first determination. The landowner brought this declaratory judgment action seeking to challenge the constitutionality of the ordinance, but the supreme court dismissed the complaint on res judicata grounds, citing the earlier proceedings as bars to this proceeding. The landowner brought this appeal, arguing the constitutionality of the ordinance was not previously raised, and could not have been properly raised, in the earlier N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceedings. The court found the earlier dismissals of the variance applications did not have res judicata effect on the landowner's constitutional challenge. The administrative proceeding could not have been converted to a declaratory judgment action because the village was not a party in the previous actions and the constitutional argument was not previously raised. Moreover, until the variance was denied, the constitutional issue was not ripe.</SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. art. 78 challenging the commissioner's failure to mandate a specific driver and traffic safety education curriculum.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instructor, along with six others, filed a combined N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding and action under N.Y. State Fin. Law &sect; 123-b, which challenged the commissioner's alleged failure to mandate a specific driver and traffic safety (DTSE) curriculum. The commissioner filed a motion to dismiss the petition for failure to state a cause of action and for lack of standing. The trial court granted the motion, and the instructor appealed. The court held that the instructor, as a full time DTSE instructor, lacked standing, because he was unable to show that the commissioner's actions had actually harmed him and that the interest that he asserted was arguably within the zone of interest to be protected. Further, the instructor could not show standing as a citizen taxpayer pursuant to &sect; 123-b, since he had not demonstrated the involvement of state funds. Finally, because each individual school district was free to elect whether to offer DTSE and, if it was offered, whether it would be offered within or outside the regular school schedule, the instructor's claims lacked even colorable merit. The trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff commenced a medical malpractice action against defendants. Following joinder of issue, defendants brought a motion to dismiss the complaint principally due to plaintiff's failure to comply with N.Y.

To avoid dismissal, the trial court ordered plaintiff to, within 30 days of its order, file a certificate of merit and pay each defendant a specified sum. Plaintiff appealed that decision, and the court affirmed. However, plaintiff never complied with the trial court's order and, consequently, defendants again each brought a motion for a final order of dismissal. In response, plaintiff argued for the first time that N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3012-a was unconstitutional. The trial court rejected plaintiff's constitutional claim on the merits and granted defendants' motions for a trial order of dismissal. Plaintiff appealed. The court affirmed because the state's objective in enacting the statute passed the rational basis test as it involved the health and welfare of the community. Thus there was no violation of plaintiff's equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, infant and her parents, sought review of a decision of the Supreme Court of Chenango County (New York), which dismissed all causes of action against defendant drug manufacturers that sought to recover damages for plaintiff infant's various physical disabilities. Plaintiffs had alleged causes of action against defendant that sounded in negligence, strict products liability, breach of warranty, and fraud.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, infant and her parents, brought an action versus defendant drug manufacturers that was related to plaintiff infant's various physical disabilities alleged to have arisen from plaintiff infant's grandmother's exposure to the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES). Plaintiffs alleged causes of action against defendant that sounded in negligence, strict products liability, breach of warranty, and fraud. The lower court dismissed all causes of action against defendant that sought to recover damages for plaintiff infant's various physical disabilities. The lower court held in part that New York did not recognize preconception tort liability. The court reversed the lower court's judgment with respect to its determination on the validity of plaintiff infant's strict products liability cause of action. The court held that there was no sound basis for denying plaintiff infant her day in court because plaintiff infant was no less a victim of the devastation wrought by DES than was her mother. As modified, the remainder of the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's order and allowed an action by plaintiffs, infant and her parents, against defendant drug manufacturers with respect to the preconception strict products liability theory advanced by plaintiff infant. The court held that there was no sound basis for denying plaintiff infant her day in court because she was no less a victim of the drug diethylstilbestrol than was her mother. The order was affirmed as modified.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Products Liability -- Strict Products Liability -- Toxic Torts -- Preconception Tort -- Ingestion of DES by Plaintiff's Grandmother</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An infant plaintiff, who was born with various physical disabilities, has a cause of action in strict products liability against the manufacturers of the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES), which was allegedly ingested by plaintiff's grandmother while pregnant with plaintiff's mother and allegedly caused certain physical abnormalities in the mother's reproductive system, which, in turn, prevented plaintiff's mother from carrying her to full term, thereby causing plaintiff to develop severe disabilities which will affect her for her entire life; in light of the Legislature's policy of favoring a remedy for DES-caused injuries </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, L 1986, ch 682, &sect; 4 -- the toxic tort revival statute) and the absence of the necessity of establishing manageable bounds for liability under a strict products liability theory, the infant plaintiff has a cause of action for injuries caused by her mother's exposure to DES prior to plaintiff's conception.  Plaintiff is no less a victim of DES exposure than her mother, and there is no sound basis for denying plaintiff her day in court; plaintiff's burden of proving proximate cause provides an adequate boundary of the manufacturers' legal responsibility for birth defects caused by DES.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal -- Preservation of Issue for Review -- Abandoned Issues</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action sounding in strict products liability the only disputed issue to be resolved on appeal concerns preconception tort liability; since plaintiffs have not briefed the question of whether parents may recover damages for emotional distress resulting from the birth of an impaired child, plaintiff's appeal from the dismissal of that cause of action is deemed abandoned, as is the dismissal of the cause of action of plaintiff's father seeking damages based upon the inability to have a natural healthy child from his marriage.   </SPAN></P>

The judge originally denied the request in toto, but modified the ruling by releasing an edited version of the questionnaires. The released version deleted the names of the jurors and any information that would have enabled the public to learn the jurors' identities. The judge's ruling was based upon the daily increasing tense emotions among the members of the victim's family and the defendant's family and reported threats against defense counsel. The newspaper filed an action pursuant N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 to compel the judge to make the entire questionnaires public. The newspaper claimed that the restricted public access to the voir dire was unconstitutional. The court disagreed with the newspaper's claim. The court ruled that the judge's deletion of a very small fraction of the material in the written questionnaires was justified in order to allow the jurors to serve without fear of intimidation or harassment, and that the newspaper's constitutional rights were not abridged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purpose of the Long Island Power Authority Act was to create a publicly owned power authority, to acquire any or all of plaintiff's stock or assets to assure the provision of an adequate supply of gas and electricity in a reliable, efficient, and economic manner to the residents. Plaintiff sought review of defendant town's assessments of its nuclear-power plant on the grounds that they are excessive, unequal, and unlawful. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which denied intervenor and defendants' motions for summary judgment. By enacting N.Y. Real Prop.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 7607(a) established an insurance security fund to protect against loss due to insurer insolvency.

Such appropriation was deemed an asset of the fund and was payable to the fund in the event that the fund's other assets were depleted. Pursuant to N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 7603(b), (c)(1), the tax commissioner ordered insurers to made contributions to the fund when it fell below a certain level. In consolidated actions, the insurers then sought a declaratory judgment that &sect; 7603 was unconstitutional in that it impaired the state's contract obligations and deprived the insurers of their property without due process of law. The trial court granted the tax commissioner's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the statutes were constitutional.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a proceeding to review a determination of the Department of Labor which established the prevailing wage rate on a public work project performed for the New York Power Authority, petitioner failed to demonstrate that the Department's determination was arbitrary, capricious or without legal basis; the purpose of the prevailing wage law (Labor Law &sect; 220) is to protect workers by ensuring that they have an effective remedy to secure the prevailing wage, which is that paid under collective bargaining agreements to at least 30% of those employed in the same trade or occupation in a given locality. &quot;Trade or occupation&quot; classifications for work embraced by the statute are a matter given to the expertise of the Department; upon a review of the record, it is concluded that the work envisaged by the project, the rewinding of off-line generators, is performed by electricians, and does not constitute work performed by the &quot;trade or occupation&quot; of &quot;winder&quot; which is so distinct therefrom as to render the Department's determination arbitrary or capricious. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a proceeding to review a determination of the Department of Labor which established the prevailing wage rate on a public work project performed for the New York Power Authority, the failure of the Authority to file its own classification of workers to be employed on the project, together with a statement of the work to be performed by each such classification (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Labor Law &sect; 220 [3-a]), does not require annulment of the Department's determination.  Although the Authority did not provide the Department with the specific classifications for the project, it did file the project's technical specifications, describing in detail the work to be done, and that sufficiently complied with the statute; any failure by the Authority to strictly comply with the statute had no material effect on the Department's duty to make a proper classification. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labor -- Prevailing Rate of Wages -- Rule Promulgation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The classification and prevailing wage determinations of the Department of Labor for a public work project performed for the New York Power Authority are not subject to the rule promulgation requirements of the State Administrative Procedure Act, since the Department's classifications are sufficiently established on a case-by-case analysis of the work to be performed such that they do not constitute a rule or regulation requiring filing (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, State Administrative Procedure Act &sect; 102 [2]); moreover, Labor Law &sect; 220 adequately outlines the Department's classification requirements so that rule promulgation of the process is unnecessary.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a proceeding to review a determination of the Department of Labor which established the prevailing wage rate on a public work project performed for the New York Power Authority, Labor Law &sect; 220 (5) does not unconstitutionally delegate legislative power to private parties by allowing the Department to rely on collective bargaining agreements in determining wages; parties who negotiate the collective bargaining agreements with employers may establish the prevailing wage for public works in a locality, but only when that employer employs at least 30% of the workers engaged in that kind of work in the locality (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Labor Law &sect; 220 [5]), and although that may constitute some form of delegation of legislative power, the 30% requirement provides an ample safeguard so as to place any delegation well within constitutional limits.  The statute itself clearly limits the use of collective bargaining agreements in setting prevailing wage rates, and the use thereof is reasonably necessary to accomplish the Legislature's mandate that workers receive that prevailing wage. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">1.

It is noteworthy that where, for social policy reasons, the aforementioned general rule has been deviated from to require that certain coverages be provided, the Legislature itself has made specific provision therefor by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute.</SPAN></P>

Valid underwriting practices promote fairness to the policyholder in not requiring him to bear in premiums the costs of insuring others in higher risk categories, and the solvency of insurers. Moreover, provisions barring discrimination against insureds have been construed not to apply when differential treatment has a proper underwriting basis.  Consequently, there is not a rational basis to conclude that using the results of tests for the presence of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in determining the insurability of an applicant for health insurance is not a sound underwriting practice with regard for individual and small group policies in light of the formidable financial threat of the AIDS epidemic.</SPAN></P>

Findings of the Commissioner of Health that it is not definitively known how many HIV seropositive persons will progress to AIDS or ARC do not render irrelevant the use of HIV test results for actuarial purposes, i.e., as a means of identifying a class substantially more prone to AIDS than the general population; the scientific literature unambiguously supports the validity for underwriting purposes of more thorough HIV testing procedures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner New York City loft tenants challenged the validity of regulations enacted by respondent New York City Loft Board (board). N.Y. Mult. Dwell. Law &sect; 286 (Loft Law) allowed the owner of a covered unit first right of purchase of tenant improvements to the unit. If the owner did so, the unit became exempt from rent control. The statute also provided that purchase of improvements was not available to an owner found guilty by the board of tenant harassment. The board subsequently enacted regulations allowing an owner found guilty of such harassment to apply for the termination of such a finding, thus enabling the owner to purchase tenant improvements. The tenants argued that allowing termination of a harassment finding conflicted with the Loft Law. The trial court agreed and declared the regulations annulled. On appeal, the court reversed. The board had discretion to construe the Loft Law in accord with its purpose; other rent regulatory statutes allowed termination of a harassment finding; and it was unclear whether the Loft Law intended for a harassment finding to be irrevocable. The board's construction of the Loft Law would therefore be accorded deference by the courts.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court opined that because the inmate did not claim that he was deprived of any rights guaranteed by statutes or regulations, his petition had to be considered as alleging only violations of the Eighth Amendment prohibiting cruel and inhuman treatment. The court noted that the conditions challenged were typical of confinement in maximum security and that the inmate was not physically injured by the items he lacked.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, husband and wife, brought an action against appellees, manufacturers of the prescription drug, diethylstilbestrol (DES), seeking the recovery of damages for injuries allegedly sustained as a result of the wife's in utero exposure to the drug in 1949. The New York Supreme Court dismissed the action as time-barred because it was brought after the expiration of the one-year period of the Toxic Tort Revival Statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court reasoned that the period could not be affected by the tolling provisions applicable to statutes of limitation even if New York courts were to adopt the Federal doctrine, which permitted tolling of a statute of limitations during the pendency of a class action. On appeal the court agreed. The court first held that the revival statute's one-year period was a condition precedent, rather than a statute of limitations. The revival statute revived extinguished claims and created a new right of action, but absent the revival statute, the husband and wife were without a remedy for their claims. The husband and wife claimed that the action was nonetheless timely by virtue of the commencement of two purported class actions within the one-year window period. The court disagreed. The court found that the courts had to construe revival statutes narrowly and that permitting tolling would expand the revival statute. In addition, the husband in wife did not belong to either of the two classes, so the class actions could not toll the revival statute if it was treated as a statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

Where a liability is created by a statute which limits the right of action thereon to a stated period of time, the effect is that at the termination of that time the liability expires, leaving nothing thereafter on which to predicate an action.  Accordingly, compliance with the time period is a substantive element of the cause of action. Moreover, the literal language of the toxic tort revival statute, upon which any DES action based on a time-barred claim is dependent, supports the conclusion that commencement of the action within the window period is a condition precedent, since the statute clearly states that any claim is revived &quot;provided such action is commenced within one year from the effective date of this act&quot;.</SPAN></P>

The fact that common-law tort remedies for plaintiffs' injuries predated the revival statute is beside the point; the public policy behind the statute was to promote uniformity; a goal which would be frustrated if tolling provisions were applicable.  Moreover, revived actions are treated more restrictively, since revival is an extreme exercise of legislative power; uncertainties are resolved against consequences so drastic.</SPAN></P>

Inasmuch as plaintiffs herein are not members of the classes represented by the two class actions pending against the instant defendants, it cannot be said that the pendency of those class actions have put defendants on notice of the substance of plaintiffs' claims, which is the rationale for the Federal tolling doctrine.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The count of an information charging defendant attorney with violating Judiciary Law &sect; 482, which prohibits an attorney from employing any person for the purpose of soliciting legal business, is facially sufficient where it alleged that an informant referred cases to the defendant in the past for a fee, the informant told defendant he had a case to refer to him, the defendant told the informant to bring the client to his office, the informant escorted an undercover police officer to defendant's office, the officer signed a retainer, and the defendant paid the informant and discussed payment for future referrals. The information alleges both a prior arrangement, wherein the informant had been paid by defendant for past referrals, and the giving and receiving of compensation for the recommendation of the defendant to the officer.  Thus, the information alleges affirmative acts to steer potential clients to defendant in exchange for payment.  Also, if true, the allegations are sufficient to establish that defendant employed an informant to solicit business for him.  The act of solicitation does not require the solicitor to convince the &quot;client&quot; of the need for an attorney.  </SPAN></P>

Judiciary Law &sect; 482, which prohibits an attorney from employing any person for the purpose of soliciting legal business, is constitutional as applied to the defendant attorney, who allegedly paid an informant for referring clients.  The United States Supreme Court has upheld the prohibition against in-person solicitation of legal business for remuneration by an attorney against a constitutional attack, based upon the important State interests which support the ban.  Solicitation by a lawyer's agents or runners would present similar problems.  </SPAN></P>

While Rent Stabilization Law (Administrative Code) &sect; 26-517 (e) would have barred petitioner's landlord from collecting rent in excess of $ 174.75 until the registration statement was finally filed on July 31, 1997, a rent overcharge does not occur when a registration statement is filed or late-filed, but rather, when an owner collects &quot;an overcharge above the rent authorized for a housing accommodation&quot; (Rent Stabilization Law [Administrative Code] &sect; 26-516 [a]).  The filing of a registration statement is relevant in overcharge cases only insofar as it is determinative of the legal regulated rent, and respondent does not claim that an overcharge occurred when the rent collected is measured against the legal regulated rent. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Appellants' claim that they cannot be held liable after their replacement at the helm of the bankrupt corporate debtor in possession by a Trustee lacks merit. The Scharf family owns the majority of the Corporation's shares, and the evidence adduced at trial indicates that appellants are still de facto in control of it. Accordingly, as &quot;owners&quot; of the Premises under the HMC, appellants are obligated to undertake and finance the restoration of the Premises under the lower court's order of September 26, 1995.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landlord and Tenant - Housing Code Violations - Restoration of Fire Damaged Building - Applicability of Housing Maintenance Code The Housing Maintenance Code (HMC) (Administrative Code of City of NY, tit 27, ch 2), which provides for enforcement of minimum housing standards and requires the owner to keep the premises in good repair and to be responsible for compliance with the requirements of the code, is controlling in a dispute arising out of the restoration of a building that was destroyed by fire where the trial court found the premises salvageable, although at considerable cost, since the fundamental purpose of the HMC is to correct any condition leading to the deterioration of salvageable housing. Although in poor condition, most of the building exists.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landlord and Tenant - Rent Regulation - Restoration of Fire Damaged Building - Economic Infeasibility Defense - Proof of Cost In a Housing Part proceeding where petitioners, rent-stabilized tenants and proprietary lessees, seek restoration of a building that was severely damaged by fire, respondent shareholders and managing agents of respondent cooperative corporation failed to establish the affirmative defense of economic infeasibility. Although the cost of repairs would most likely exceed the market value of the restored premises, the respondents presented no proof of the costs they would incur if the building is not restored, which is necessary for comparison.  If not restored, respondents will have to bear the cost of demolition, or putting the building in compliance with the applicable statutes, as well as the cost for relocating displaced rent-stabilized tenants. In addition, the corporation and respondents may be liable to the tenant shareholders for the destruction of their proprietary leaseholds.  Furthermore, respondents failed to show that the market value of the restored premises will not equal the difference between the cost of restoration and the cost of demolishing along with all other expenses ancillary to the cost of demolition. Finally, no proof was presented that, once restored, the premises would not generate enough income to recover the cost discrepancy in a reasonable time.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landlord and Tenant - Rent Regulation - Restoration of Fire Damaged Building - Applicability of Marine Rule The marine rule, which provides that if the cost of restoration of a building exceeds one half the value of the building before the damage, then it is deemed a total destruction and does not require repair, is inapplicable to residential buildings, especially where there are protected tenancies and cooperative apartments.  To apply the marine rule to residential property would thwart the public policy that housing be maintained in safe and habitable condition.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landlord and Tenant - Rent Regulation - Restoration of Fire Damaged Building - Economic Infeasibility Defense - Self-Inflicted Hardship In a Housing Part proceeding where petitioners, rent-stabilized tenants and proprietary lessees, seek restoration of a building that was severely damaged by fire, respondent shareholders and managing agents of respondent cooperative corporation may not rely on the affirmative defense of economic infeasibility, where one respondent, acting as president of the Board of Directors, deliberately reduced the original $ 3 million replacement cost insurance policy and did not report the reduction to the corporations' Board of Directors for three months.  Other members of the cooperative board and the shareholders were not given any serious input into the significant reduction in insurance coverage.  The underinsurance amounts to a bad business decision for whose consequences they are responsible.  This underinsurance also breached respondents' statutory duty and contractual obligations to the petitioner proprietary lessees. The corporations' offering plan provided that the sponsors would carry at least $ 3 million in replacement cost insurance and respondents never amended the offering plan to disclose the reduced coverage in violation of 13 NYCRR 18.3 (w) (11).  Inasmuch as respondents and the other sponsors still held two thirds of the shares and controlled the corporation, respondents' failure to amend the offering plan to disclose the underinsurance breached a duty both to the proprietary lessees and the public at large.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Taking of Property - Restoration of Fire Damaged Residential Apartment Building - Physical Taking In a Housing Part proceeding, an order mandating respondent shareholders and managing agents of respondent cooperative corporation to restore a building that was severely damaged by fire and was formerly occupied by petitioners, rent-stabilized tenants and proprietary lessees, does not constitute an unconstitutional physical taking.  The statutory requirement that a landlord keep residential property in good repair is a legitimate exercise of the police power.  Respondents purchased the premises and operated it as residential property subject to the Housing Maintenance Code (Administrative Code of City of NY, tit 27, ch 2) and other housing laws.  This order protects the existing tenancies and leaseholds.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Taking of Property - Restoration of Fire Damaged Residential Apartment Building - Regulatory Taking In a Housing Part proceeding, an order mandating respondent shareholders and managing agents of respondent cooperative corporation to restore a building that was severely damaged by fire and was formerly occupied by petitioners, rent-stabilized tenants and proprietary lessees, does not constitute an unconstitutional regulatory taking. Government regulation may be deemed a regulatory taking if it denies an owner economically viable use of his property or if it does not substantially advance legitimate State interests.  Respondents made no showing that the premises, once restored, will not generate sufficient income to offset the restoration expenses over time.  Moreover, the State has a legitimate interest in keeping residential properties habitable, even after fire damage, and the Housing Maintenance Code (Administrative Code of City of NY, tit 27, ch 2) and other statutes and regulations advance these interests.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landlord and Tenant - Rent Regulation - &quot;Owner&quot; Defined In a Housing Part proceeding, respondents, a cooperative corporation's president who is directly in control of the premises, and the registered managing agent for the premises who is a partner in the management company and secretary of the corporation, are &quot;owners&quot; under the Housing Maintenance Code (Administrative Code of City of NY, tit 27, ch 2) inasmuch as they are directly or indirectly in control of the premises.  The Housing Maintenance Code will pierce the corporate veil and hold the true owners rather than holders of title responsible for violations.  Here, along with other family members under their control, respondents were the majority shareholders of the corporations' shares, controlled the Board of Directors and made and implemented all policy decisions, including the relinquishment of full replacement cost casualty insurance, thus causing the premises to be underinsured at the time of the fire.  They also acted as landlords to the nonshareholder tenants and caused the corporation to seek protection of the Bankruptcy Court.  The corporation was the alter ego of the respondents.  Despite the existence of a bankruptcy trustee, the family still owns the majority of the corporation's shares and respondents are still de facto in control.  </SPAN></P>

The Legislature intended to impose cumulative sanctions under these two statutes for a single course of conduct. Although the license suspension imposes some deterrence, the deterrence is not so punitive as to be unconstitutional.  The public safety is enhanced by this judicially ordered suspension in the context of the already-existing criminal proceeding. Also, to the extent that the temporary suspension lasts only until the conclusion of the section 1192 (2) prosecution, it is not a prosecution within the meaning of CPL 40.30 (1) and does not constitute double jeopardy under CPL 40.20 (2).  Finally, the statute is only viable as part of a section 1192 (2) or (3) prosecution.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was an officer and employee of a company in the aerial advertising business, para-sailed an advertising banner over the Hudson River and was charged with violating New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 10-126(d)(1), prohibiting any person to use, suffer, or permit to be used advertising in the form of towing banners from or upon an aircraft over the limits of New York City. Defendant's company displayed banners in navigable airspace under the authority of a Certificate of Waiver or Authorization issued by the Federal Aviation Administration, which specifically authorized defendant to conduct his business in the navigable airspace where he sailed his banners. The court granted defendant's motion to dismiss charge, finding that however salutary and well intentioned the New York Administrative Code might have been, it prohibited, not regulated, what the federal government had authorized. Thus, &sect; 10-126(d)(1) was unconstitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Motion to dismiss granted; charge that defendant violated municipal law prohibiting person to advertise in form of towing banners from or upon aircraft over city limits was unconstitutional, as defendant operated under authority of Certificate of Waiver or Authorization issued by the Federal Aviation Administration.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statutes - Federal Preemption - Flying Advertisement Banners from Para-sail over Hudson River </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 10-126 (d) (1), which makes it unlawful for a person to advertise by towing banners from or upon an aircraft over the City limits, is preempted by Federal law.  Accordingly, the summons charging defendant with a violation of this statute arising from his business activities of towing advertisements from a para-sail pulled by boats in the navigable airspace over the Hudson River is dismissed.  Where the Federal Government has enacted laws dealing with a particular subject matter, State or local regulation in that field is not proscribed unless national uniformity is essential.  If the local ordinance entirely proscribes and prohibits that which is permitted by the Federal law, it must be uniformly stricken down.  49 USC &sect; 40103 (a) (1) grants the United States Government exclusive sovereignty of airspace of the United States, and the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has broad authority to regulate the use of the Nation's navigable airspace (49 USC &sect; 40103 [b] [2]).  Above all else, a citizen of the United States has a public right of transit through the navigable airspace (49 USC &sect; 40103 [a] [2]).  The defendant applied for and received a Certificate of Waiver or Authorization from the FAA which allows him to operate a moored kite (para-sail) from a vessel for advertising purposes over the Hudson River.  Further, the FAA defines a para-sail as a moored kite, not an aircraft. However salutary and well intentioned the Code may be, it entirely prohibits, not regulates, what the Federal Government has authorized.  Thus, Administrative Code &sect; 10-126 (d) (1) is unconstitutional on its face.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the charge of aggravated harassment had to be dismissed because the accusatory instrument failed to allege that defendant intentionally subjected complainant to physical contact, or attempted or threatened to do so. Defendant argued that merely spitting in complainant's face was insufficient to establish intentional conduct or physical contact. The court held that spitting on the complainant was offensive physical contact. For the purposes of facial sufficiency, the allegation that defendant spit in complainant's face coupled with racial epithets was adequate and defendant's motion to dismiss aggravated harassment count was denied. Speech accompanied by spitting was sufficient to charge harassment in the second degree. The physical act of spitting could be offensive physical contact but the physical menace had to place complainant in fear of imminent physical injury. Spitting in complainant's face could not result in serious physical injury or physical injury. Therefore, the menacing charge was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. For purposes of facial sufficiency, spitting in the face of the complainant while using racial epithets constitutes offensive &quot;physical contact&quot; within the meaning of the aggravated harassment statute (Penal Law &sect; 240.30 [3]).  The statute provides that a person is guilty of the offense &quot;when, with intent to harass, annoy, threaten or alarm another person, he or she ... [s]trikes, shoves, kicks, or otherwise subjects another person to physical contact, or attempts or threatens to do the same because of the race, color, religion or national origin of such person.&quot; The intent of the statute is to prohibit violence and physical intimidation based upon bigotry. Violent conduct and not speech is what is being regulated.  Defendant's alleged conduct is precisely the type of physical intimidation based on bigotry that the statute was intended to target.  Racial epithets create a viable inference that the conduct was racially motivated.  Accordingly, defendant's motion to dismiss the aggravated harassment charge for facial insufficiency is denied.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. An information charging defendant with harassment in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 240.26 [1]) for having allegedly spit in the face of the complainant while using racial epithets is facially sufficient.  The statute provides that a person is guilty of the offense &quot;when, with intent to harass, annoy, threaten or alarm another person, [h]e or she ... strikes, shoves, kicks, or otherwise subjects another person to physical contact, or attempts or threatens to do the same.&quot; Speech accompanied by &quot;spitting&quot; on the victim constitutes offensive &quot;physical contact&quot; within the meaning of the statute for purposes of facial sufficiency.  The determination of whether words which are sufficient for pleading purposes are ultimately punishable must await a trial.

A count in an information charging defendant with menacing in the third degree (Penal Law &sect; 120.15) for having allegedly spit in the face of the complainant while using racial epithets must be dismissed for facial insufficiency. The statute provides that a person is guilty of the offense &quot;when, by physical menace, he or she intentionally places or attempts to place another person in fear of death, imminent serious physical injury or physical injury.&quot; Spitting in complainant's face, although sufficient to constitute offensive &quot;physical contact&quot; for purposes of the harassment charges against defendant (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 240.26 [1]; &sect; 240.30 [3]), cannot alone constitute the type of physical menace that would place complainant in fear of imminent physical injury within the meaning of the menacing statute.  The facts alleged in the information are insufficient to determine defendant's intent. Some other act must transpire before complainant could reasonably fear physical injury. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a funeral directors association and its president, moved for a preliminary injunction enjoining defendants, City of New York (City), New York City Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA), and DCA's Commissioner, from enforcing newly amended local rules regulating the funeral home industry.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a funeral directors association and its president, sought a declaratory judgment against defendants, City of New York (City), New York City Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA), and DCA's Commissioner, declaring invalid N.Y. City Rules 5-162, 5-164 ,5-165 and 5-166 as amended. Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. In order to show entitlement to a preliminary injunction, plaintiffs needed to establish (1) the likelihood of success on the merits; (2) irreparable injury absent granting the preliminary injunction; and (3) a balancing of the equities. The court denied plaintiffs' motion, because plaintiffs did not demonstrate that the equities balanced in their favor. Plaintiffs' argument against enforcement of the City's rules was that the State had preempted the field of funeral home regulation. This argument was unavailing. The court determined that regulation of the same subject matter by both the State and a locality did not give rise to an express conflict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Motion denied; plaintiffs did not show that they were entitled to a preliminary injunction.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local Laws - Preemption by State - Regulation of Funeral Home Business </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Rules promulgated by defendant Commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs regarding disclosure by funeral homes of price and other information are not preempted by Public Health Law article 34 and its implementing regulations, which regulate the funeral home industry. Local laws may be invalidated as inconsistent with State law where there is an express conflict and where the State has evinced a desire to preempt an entire field, thereby precluding further local regulation. The fact that the State and City both seek to regulate the same subject matter does not in and of itself give rise to an express conflict.  Although the State's laws are detailed, the State Legislature has not expressed a desire to take a centralized or comprehensive approach to regulating this industry.  In fact, article 34 implicitly permits local legislation which is not inconsistent with State law.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Regulation of Funeral Home Business - Rules Disclosing Price Information - State Preemption </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Rules promulgated by defendant Commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, which require funeral homes to display price lists in the immediate vicinity of the establishment's main public entrance (6 RCNY 5-162 [c] [2]) and provide certain price information over the telephone (6 RCNY 5-164 [a], [b]), are not invalid as inconsistent with State law and regulations. The State has not preempted the field of funeral home regulation. Also, the State does not specifically permit any conduct prescribed by the rule, nor are the two sets of laws otherwise inconsistent.  Public Health Law &sect; 3440-a mandates funeral directors to furnish a written statement showing the prices, and 10 NYCRR 79.4 requires that the funeral home present a printed or typewritten price list for individuals inquiring about arrangements or prices.  Section 5-162 (c) (2) merely goes beyond the State law by requiring that price lists be displayed.  This additional protection is not inconsistent with State law. Similarly, section 5-164 is not inconsistent with 10 NYCRR 79.1 which regulates disclosure of pricing information over the telephone, as it simply imposes additional requirements on providers when giving price information over the telephone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Regulation of Funeral Home Business - Rules Disclosing Ownership Interest in Funeral Homes - State Preemption </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. A rule promulgated by defendant New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, which requires providers of funeral services to display the names of each licensed funeral director-owner and ownership entity with a 10% or greater ownership interest in the funeral home on a sign located either immediately outside or inside the main entrance, and requires the name, address and telephone number of such entity to be listed on all advertising material (6 RCNY 5-165), does not conflict with State law and regulations prohibiting unlicensed and unregistered funeral firms and directors from displaying their names upon or in the establishment or in advertising (Public Health Law &sect; 3443 [1] [a]; 10 NYCRR 77.5 [c] [4], [5]).  The rule does not conflict with or undermine the State law and regulations designed to prevent unlicensed and unregistered funeral establishments and individuals from giving the impression that they are licensed or registered, and/or doing business as such.  The rule supplements the State's regulations by providing the consumer with further identifying information.  Furthermore, the State regulations are not intended to prohibit additional local regulation, as 10 NYCRR 77.5 (c) (4) provides &quot;[s]igns shall conform with all local laws, ordinances and regulations.&quot; Moreover, Public Health Law &sect; 3443 prohibits the display of the names of unlicensed individuals and the rule requires the display of licensed individuals.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Regulation of Funeral Home Business - Authority of Commissioner of Department of Consumer Affairs to Promulgate Rules </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. The Commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) acted within his authority when adopting rules which require providers of funeral services to disclose price and other information.  New York City Charter &sect; 2203 (d) and (e) give the Commissioner the power to enforce all laws relating to the sale of goods and services and to promulgate, amend and modify rules and regulations necessary to carry out the powers of the DCA. Under Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 20-737, the Commissioner is broadly mandated to promulgate rules and regulations reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes of protecting consumers from excessive funeral costs and providing for the disclosure of pricing and related information.  Although the Administrative Code does not directly refer to the sale of monuments, the Commissioner's authority to regulate this area can be implied from the Commissioner's broad mandate.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Regulation of Funeral Home Business - Rules Disclosing Price Information </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. A rule promulgated by defendant Commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, which requires providers of funeral services to publicly display price lists in the immediate vicinity of an establishment's main public entrance (6 RCNY 5-162), does not conflict with Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 20-732, which only requires a funeral home to display pricing information prominently at the funeral home premises and to provide such information upon request.  Merely because the rule provides an additional layer of protection to consumers does not mean that the rule is contrary to the Administrative Code provision or that it was enacted outside the scope of the Commissioner's authority.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Regulation of Funeral Home Business - Rules Disclosing Price Information and Ownership Interest </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. Rules promulgated by defendant Commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, which require providers of funeral services to publicly display price lists in the immediate vicinity of the establishment's main public entrance (6 RCNY 5-162), disclose an owner or entity which has a 10% or greater interest in the business (6 RCNY 5-164), and disclose a separate price list for monuments are rationally related to a legitimate government purpose and, thus, are valid.  Judicial review of administrative rule making is confined to determining whether rules have a rational basis and are not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. The rules are rationally related to defendants' legitimate goal of protecting consumers. They also provide consumers with complete and easy access to pricing information regarding funeral costs and to ownership information.  The rule regarding the sale of monuments has a rational basis in that having a separate contract for this part of the process allows consumers to evaluate needs when they are less emotionally involved.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Regulation of Funeral Home Business - Rule Disclosing Ownership Interest in Advertising Material </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7. The term &quot;advertising material&quot; in a rule promulgated by defendant Commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, which requires a funeral business to list names, addresses and phone numbers of business entities having a 10% or greater ownership interest in the funeral home on all &quot;advertising material&quot; (6 RCNY 5-165 [b]), is not unconstitutionally vague. Due process requires only a reasonable degree of certainty so that individuals of ordinary intelligence are not forced to guess at the meaning of statutory terms.  Plaintiff entities in the funeral home business can easily interpret the term themselves in order to determine what material they use for advertising purposes.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Injunctions - Preliminary Injunction - Staying Enforcement of Rules Regulating Funeral Home Business </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 8. Plaintiffs are not entitled to a preliminary injunction in their action challenging rules promulgated by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs regulating the funeral home business where they failed to file a statement pursuant to CPLR 6001, which mandates that a plaintiff seeking a provisional remedy must state whether any other such remedy has been secured or sought in the same action against the same defendants.  This statement enables a court to determine whether it should exercise its discretion to require a plaintiff to elect between any provisional remedy previously obtained and that or those now sought.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found to interpret N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts.

Penal Law &sect; 240.26(1) the shoving, striking, or kicking of a person by another was not a crime, but constituted harassment, a non-criminal violation. The court found that the Legislature's intent could not have been to hold a person to a higher standard of conduct with respect to an animal than toward a fellow human being. The court found that &quot;physical injury&quot; had to be inferred as an element that had to be alleged and proven to sustain a violation under the statute as it applied to defendant. The court found no allegations that the defendant attempted to cause or actually caused physical injury to his dog.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Animals - Cruelty to Animals - Requirement of Physical Injury to Animal </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a prosecution in which it was alleged that defendant kicked his dog two or three times and threw it to the ground, an information charging defendant with cruelly beating his dog in violation of Agriculture and Markets Law &sect; 353 must be dismissed for facial insufficiency where there are no allegations that defendant attempted to cause or actually caused physical injury to his dog. In light of the fact that one cannot legally &quot;assault&quot; a human being without there being &quot;physical injury&quot; to the victim, to interpret section 353 in such a manner as to make defendant's alleged conduct criminal is not rational.  The Legislature's intent could not have been to hold a person to a higher standard of conduct with respect to an animal than toward a fellow human being.  Thus, &quot;physical injury&quot; must necessarily be inferred to be an element which must be alleged and proven to sustain a violation under section 353.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A criminal defendant's motion to enjoin the State from seeking the death penalty is denied where defendant was arraigned on an indictment charging him with second degree murder and other crimes, and the People reserved the right to file a capital murder indictment should evidence become available supporting such charges, since the issue is not ripe for judicial review. For the death penalty to be a potential punishment, the People must file a notice of intent to seek the death penalty within 120 days following defendant's arraignment upon an indictment charging first degree murder. A request for an injunction or declaratory judgment is premature if the harm to the petitioner is contingent upon events that may never occur.  Here, the harm to defendant is contingent upon two events that may never occur: filing a first degree murder indictment against him and filing a notice of intent to seek the death penalty. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant returned to her former employer and sat in a chair and refused to leave the premises after repeatedly being told to leave. After arrest, a police officer attempted to take the defendant to the fingerprint station. The defendant repeatedly pulled away from the officer and finally sat in a chair and refused to get up. Defendant was charged with criminal trespass and obstruction of governmental administration. Defendant moved to dismiss her charges on the ground that the accusatory instrument was facially insufficient. Defendant also unsuccessfully argued that the statute defining the crime of obstruction was unconstitutionally vague. The court dismissed the trespass charge, because the accusatory instrument did not set forth any facts establishing that the office was fenced or otherwise enclosed in a manner designed to exclude intruders and therefore failed to establish every element of the crime of trespass and the defendant's commission of that crime.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Criminal Trespass - Sufficiency of Accusatory Instrument </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Under Penal Law &sect; 140.10 (a), which provides that a person is guilty of trespass in the third degree when he or she knowingly enters or remains unlawfully in a building or upon real property which is fenced or otherwise enclosed in a manner designed to exclude intruders, the phrase &quot;which is fenced or otherwise enclosed in a manner designed to exclude intruders,&quot; modifies both the words &quot;building&quot; and &quot;upon real property.&quot; Accordingly, the accusatory instrument charging defendant with trespass in the third degree for refusing to leave a dental office, which failed to set forth that the office was enclosed in a manner to exclude intruders, is facially insufficient.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Obstructing Governmental Administration - Interfering with Fingerprinting Process </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant was appropriately charged with obstructing governmental administration (Penal Law &sect; 195.05) when she prevented a police officer from fingerprinting her upon her arrest. Penal Law &sect; 195.05 prohibits a person from intentionally preventing or attempting to prevent a public servant from performing an official function by means of physical force or interference.  Under CPL 160.10 (1), the arresting officer was required to fingerprint the defendant following her arrest. Thus, the officer was attempting to perform an official function when he sought to fingerprint the defendant.  Also, by pulling away from the officer and sitting in a chair during the fingerprint attempt, the defendant affirmatively resisted the officer's attempt to fingerprint her and these actions on her part constitute physical force as well as physically interfering with the officer's attempt to perform an official function.  </SPAN></P>

A legislative enactment must inform the average person of fair notice that his or her action is forbidden by law and may not engender arrests, prosecutions and convictions that are arbitrary and erratic. What is and what is not the administration of law or other governmental function is not beyond the understanding of the average person. The prohibition of preventing the performance of an official function by means of intimidation, physical force or interference, or by means of any independently unlawful act is also clear and not unconstitutionally vague in defining the type of activities which are prohibited, and is not subject to arbitrary and erratic arrests, prosecutions and convictions.  That portion of the statute which sets forth what constitutes preventing or attempting to prevent the performance of an official function is also clear, unambiguous and not subject to interpretation.  It prohibits an individual from intentionally and affirmatively engaging in conduct which is designed to prevent the orderly administration of government.  </SPAN></P>

Claimant individually filed a claim for compensation, wherein claimant sought damages for the loss of his claimed leasehold based upon the difference between his former rent, and the rent on the premises to which he relocated, times a multiple of two to compensate for the downsize in space for the period of his remaining life expectancy of 25 years. While claimant's, month-to-month single room occupancy was protected by the rent laws against removal in the ordinary relationship of landlord and tenant, the statutes did not in themselves create any further property interest, let alone the life estate claimant asserted. Claimant failed to demonstrate a compensable property interest arising out of his former occupancy of a room. Therefore, condemnor's motion for summary judgment was granted and claimant's compensation claims were dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although a month-to-month tenant in a single room occupancy (SRO) residence is protected by rent laws against removal, such statutes do not create any further property interest. Accordingly, inasmuch as a month-to-month tenant has no property interest that entitles him to compensation in an eminent domain proceeding, the tenant's claims for compensation based on an asserted life estate are dismissed.  In condemnation, the compensation awarded an owner is based upon an unencumbered fee value.  Any award made to a tenant for his leasehold interest would then be carved out of the award the owner received.  If every SRO tenant in a condemned SRO hotel had his interest valued as claimant contends, then the sum total of their &quot;leasehold claims&quot; would leave nothing for the fee owner.  </SPAN></P>

New York law governed 10 of the 14 transactions at issue. The remaining four transactions were governed by English law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This proceeding for custody of a child in foster care was brought by petitioner, the child's grandmother. Respondent mother argued that the petitioner lacked standing to seek permanent custody of the child who was placed in temporary custody, pursuant to Fam. Ct. Act &sect;1055(a). Petitioner argued that the policy reflected in recent amendments to the Fam. Ct. Act and N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law conferred standing on petitioner to seek custody. The court dismissed the petition for custody as unauthorized by the statute under which the child was placed in foster care. Moreover, treating the request as a petition for a permanency hearing under Fam. Ct. Act &sect;1055(b)(ii), petitioner failed to allege facts sufficient to establish standing to seek permanent custody of the child. The child had not remained in the petitioner's care for a 15-month period as required by N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect;384-b (3)(1)(i)(A).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social Services - Foster Care - Custody of Child Not Freed for Adoption - Standing of Kinship Foster Parent to Seek Permanent Custody </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Petitioner, the paternal grandmother and foster mother of a child who had been placed under Family Court article 10 in the temporary custody of the Administration for Children's Services upon a finding that the child was neglected by her biological mother, lacks standing to seek permanent custody of the child over the mother's objection.  A foster parent does not have standing to seek custody of a child in temporary foster care, and under the specific terms of Family Court Act article 10 this principle applies equally to kinship foster parents where a parent appears in the proceeding and objects to the relative's intervention.  Where a parent withholds consent, the court may only place the child temporarily in the custody of a relative, and even where there has been a termination of parental rights the appropriate means for a relative to obtain permanent custody of the child is to file a petition for adoption.  Although Family Court Act &sect; 1055 (b), as recently amended, permits placement of a child out of foster care and permanently in the care of a fit and willing relative, such petitions are limited to circumstances in which the parents' right to custody and guardianship of the child may otherwise be terminated. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed defendant hand another person a NYC Transit Authority token in exchange for cash. When defendant was apprehended by the arresting officer, he allegedly flailed his arms which prevented the officer from effecting the authorized arrest. Defendant was charged with illegal access to transit authority services, and resisting arrest. A judge later declared that Transit Authority Rule &sect; 1050.4(c) was vague and unconstitutional on its face. Thus, the court had to determine whether the charge of resisting arrest is valid when a police officer made an authorized arrest even though subsequent to the arrest the underlying statute has been deemed unconstitutional. The court held that that the charge of resisting arrest is valid since the police effected an &quot;authorized arrest&quot; at the time of the arrest. Review of case law indicated that dismissal of the underlying crime did not necessarily warrant preclusion of crime of resisting arrest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defendant's motion to dismiss a charge of resisting arrest (Penal Law &sect; 205.30) is denied where the offense for which defendant was arrested, exchanging a transit token for cash, was subsequently declared unconstitutional, since the arresting officer was effecting an &quot;authorized arrest&quot;, which is an essential element of the crime of resisting arrest. Where the underlying charge is dismissed for facial insufficiency, the arrest is unauthorized; however, a disposition favorable to the defendant on the underlying charge will not automatically render invalid a resisting arrest charge arising out of the same incident.  Accordingly, since the officer who arrested defendant made an authorized arrest for conduct reasonably believed to constitute an offense, the resisting arrest charge arose from subsequent independent unlawful actions of the defendant and, therefore, may be prosecuted independently of the underlying charge. </SPAN></P>

Petitioners' attempt to point out differences between themselves and the petitioner in the case which has upheld section 301-a is an &quot;as applied&quot; argument.  Moreover, petitioners' attempt to circumvent any inquiry into whether the statute has any actual impact on interstate commerce by relying on a 1929 United States Supreme Court case is unavailing, since the Court's simplistic analysis bears little or no resemblance to its present-day Commerce Clause analysis.  </SPAN></P>

Retroactive taxation is not prohibited, and the type of adjustment in question does not constitute imposition of any new or greater tax upon petitioners, does not change petitioners' expectations during almost all of the years they seek refunds for, and does not require the time restrictions normally placed on retroactive taxes.  There is no unfairness worth mentioning because petitioners would be in essentially the same position they would have been had the court denied a prior facial unconstitutionality argument and required the prior petitioner to proceed through the administrative process and establish that the statute actually does burden interstate commerce. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. In a challenge to the constitutionality of recent statutory amendments to Tax Law article 13-A, which imposes a tax on fuel oil imported into New York by vessels for consumption by the importer within New York while engaged in interstate commerce, petitioners have no valid due process argument, since the judicial decision which prompted the amendments in question did not bestow any property interest or expectation on petitioners.  Although petitioners allege that the amendments violate NY Constitution, article III, &sect; 16, they have failed to establish that the incorporation of any Tax Law sections by reference has resulted in the creation of substantive obligations or requirements, or that there is any reason to believe that the Legislature was unaware of what it was doing.  Notwithstanding the possibility that, even with the latest legislative enactments, the challenged tax was not passed through to in-State fuel purchasers, the recent statutes, when given the favorable benefit of every intention, eliminate the former facial unconstitutionality of Tax Law &sect; 301 (a) (1) (ii).  Accordingly, petitioners may not challenge the statute's constitutionality as applied in court, unless they have first exhausted their administrative remedies, raising all of their arguments and presenting any evidence that establishes that in fact the statute's costs are not passed through to consumers or that the statute otherwise contravenes the Commerce Clause by favoring the purchase of fuel in New York, as well as the actual extent of the alleged preferential effect so as to determine what if any tax refund is warranted.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In their action for declaratory and injunctive relief, plaintiffs challenged the manner in which defendant members of the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York were elected pursuant to the alternative joint ballot provision of N.Y. Educ. Law &sect;&sect; 202(1) and (2). Plaintiffs claimed the manner of election violated their right to a bicameral legislature, their right to be heard and to participate in the formulation and effectuation of state educational policy through elected representatives to the New York Senate, their right to one-person, one-vote and to proportional representation, and their right to a republican form of government. The court upheld the contested legislation as constitutional, holding that whether sitting bicamerally or unicamerally, the New York Legislature was the Legislature under N.Y. Const. art. 11, &sect; 2. Further, the &quot;one man, one vote&quot; principle was not applicable to the election of regents.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legislature - Election of Regents - Constitutionality of Joint Ballot Alternative </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statutory provision providing for the election of members of the Board of Regents by joint ballot of both houses of the Legislature meeting in joint session in the event that the Regents cannot be elected by concurrent resolution of the Legislature (Education Law &sect; 202 [1], [2]) does not unconstitutionally delegate a legislative power or function to the unicameral Legislature.  Although the unicameral Legislature cannot exercise legislative power and pass a bill into law (NY Const, art III, &sect;&sect; 1, 14), the Senate and Assembly, sitting unicamerally as a single body, still continues to constitute the Legislature, and as such, may constitutionally elect Regents. Furthermore, the joint ballot alternative for the election of Regents does not result in an unconstitutional delegation of the Legislature's fundamental law-making powers and functions.  There is no constitutional prohibition against the legislative delegation of power, with reasonable safeguards and standards, to an agency or commission to administer the law as enacted by the Legislature.  The &quot;objects&quot; of the University of the State of New York, the limitation on those persons who could be Regents, and the powers to be exercised by Regents (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Education Law &sect;&sect; 201, 202 [4]; &sect; 207) sufficiently set forth over-all policy and purpose as well as general standards and guidelines to withstand constitutional scrutiny.  The joint ballot mechanism is necessary to break legislative deadlocks over appointments and thereby ensure that seats on the Board of Regents do not remain empty.  Such procedure neither violates the equal protection principle of &quot;one person, one vote&quot; nor the constitutional guarantee of a republican form of government (US Const, art IV, &sect; 4).  </SPAN></P>

A suspension of a license under Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 226 (3) or &sect; 510 (4) (a) does not constitute a prosecution (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 40.30 [1]).  Even if it does, further prosecution under section 511-d is not barred, since double jeopardy is not violated if one of the offenses requires proof of an additional fact, and CPL 40.20 (2) (b) permits sequential prosecutions for offenses arising from the same criminal transaction if each offense contains an element which is not an element of the other and the offenses are designed to prevent different kinds of harm.  Prosecution under section 511-d requires different elements than section 226 (3) and section 510 (4) (a), its legislative purpose is to prosecute persons who show contempt for our system of driver regulation, and the statute is designed to prevent different kinds of harm than the underlying statutes.

To meet due process standards a statute must make it reasonably clear what conduct constitutes a violation and must provide sufficient enforcement standards to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, which is not apparent here.  Also section 511-d establishes criminal liability for an omission, i.e., failure to respond to appearance tickets or to pay fines. Penal Law &sect; 15.10 provides that the minimal requirement for criminal liability is the omission to perform an act.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3.

Constitutional principles are violated when an individual is incarcerated, without a proper hearing, as an alternative to payment when such person is unable to pay through no fault of his or her own.  CPL 420.10 (5) provides for a hearing and, thus, protects against incarceration as an alternative to payment for a defendant unable to pay. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, who had been foster parent to her nieces for several years, applied to adopt her nieces. Petitioner claimed that she was entitled to adopt them despite her manslaughter conviction because the New York State Adoption and Safe Families Act, N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect;&sect; 378-a(2)(e)(1) and 378-a(2)(h), which prohibited foster parenting or adoption by someone with a felony conviction for homicide, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, foster parent to her four nieces, applied to adopt her nieces after their parents executed judicial surrenders. However, the New York State Adoption and Safe Families Act, N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect;&sect; 378-a(2)(e)(1) and 378-a(2)(h) prohibited foster parenting or adoption by someone with a felony conviction for homicide. Petitioner claimed that she was entitled to adopt her nieces despite her manslaughter conviction because &sect;&sect; 378-a(2)(e)(1) and 378-a(2)(h) were unconstitutional. Family court agreed, holding that the sections established an irrebuttable presumption that a person with a criminal history was unfit to raise children. Irrebuttable presumptions were prohibited by the due process clause if they were not necessarily or universally true in fact and the state had reasonable alternative means of making the crucial determination. In petitioner's case, the state was able to determine that petitioner was fit to adopt her nieces. Several expert witnesses testified that she was a fit parent, had a strong commitment to her nieces, and that adoption by petitioner was in the girls' best interests. As a result, family court granted petitioner's application for adoption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Family court granted petitioner's application to adopt her nieces despite petitioner's conviction for manslaughter.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Social Services Law &sect; 378-a (2) (e) (1) and (2) (h), enacted by New York's Adoption and Safe Families Act (L 1999, ch 7 [ASFA]) so as to require a court to summarily deny pending adoption petitions and immediately remove children from a foster or preadoptive home whenever the petitioner has been convicted of specified criminal offenses, creates an irrebuttable presumption that fails to satisfy the due process requirements of the State and Federal Constitutions.  Accordingly, in an adoption proceeding where petitioner seeks to adopt the four nieces who have been living with her for the past seven years and the unequivocal evidence establishes that it is in the children's best interests for petitioner to adopt them, the petitions are granted despite the fact that 21 years ago petitioner pleaded guilty to manslaughter and served three years' probation for recklessly killing her abusive paramour, which conviction would otherwise bar petitioner from adopting the children under ASFA.  Permanent irrebuttable presumptions are disfavored under the Due Process Clause, and Family Court can readily provide the individualized determination that due process requires to protect the liberty interests of petitioner and her nieces. Absent such an individualized determination, petitioner's nieces and thousands of other children in State-supervised foster care are subject to an arbitrary procedure that leaves their fate to happenstance.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant suspect was charged with murder. Plaintiff state filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty. Defendant and plaintiff agreed that defendant would plead guilty to first degree murder in exchange for life without parole. Plaintiff was reluctant to withdraw the notice of intent prior to defendant's plea because plaintiff was unable to refile the notice if defendant failed to plead. Plaintiff was not allowed to conditionally withdraw the plea. In court, plaintiff stated the agreement and its intention to withdraw the notice if defendant entered a guilty plea and received the agreed sentence. The court then questioned defendant regarding the plea. Plaintiff consented to the plea and withdrew the notice. The court granted the plea application. After a review of the proceedings, the court found that the plea was valid because plaintiff withdrew the notice before the court consented to the plea. The plea was not valid until the court accepted it.

If the prosecutor withdraws a notice of intent prior to the plea, defendant might renounce the agreement once the notice is withdrawn and the People would be barred from refiling by CPL 250.40 (4). Accordingly, the prosecutor was permitted to withhold consent and withdrawal until after the defendant proffered his plea and underwent allocution. Since defendant claimed to be seeking the disposition, he could have no legitimate complaint that the sequence unfairly infringed upon his right to renege. Moreover, since a guilty plea carrying a promised sentence cannot be entered without the permission of the court, the acceptance by the court, not the proffer by defendant, makes a guilty plea cognizable; thus, a guilty plea to murder in the first degree is valid so long as no notice of intent is pending when the court accepts and enters the plea.  </SPAN></P>

A guardian appointed under adequate due process procedures, properly informed in accordance with accepted medical standards, having a superior familiarity with the incapacitated person and acting as a fiduciary under mandatory, specific standards (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 81.20 [a] [1]-[3]), is equally if not more qualified than a court to make such treatment decisions.  The incapacitated person's due process rights are protected by Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 81.36, which grants the incapacitated person or anyone concerned with his or her welfare the right to request a hearing on the continued need for treatment powers in which the burden of proof will be on the guardian to show by clear and convincing evidence that the incapacitated person is still incapable of making reasoned treatment decisions and the guardian's powers are still necessary with respect thereto.  The Mental Hygiene Law article 81 provisions concerning the authorization and exercise of the power to make decisions as to the administration of psychotropic drugs presumptively meet constitutional due process requirements and therefore medical facilities and providers may give such drugs on the basis of a guardian's consent without the need for further judicial action.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city council passed a law creating an independent board to oversee the police department. Plaintiffs city mayor and district attorney sued for declaratory and injunctive relief to have the law declared invalid. Defendant filed motion to dismiss and both sides filed motions for summary judgment. The court held that local governments have the power to enact local laws not inconsistent with the state constitution. Plaintiffs argued that only plaintiff mayor had the authority to appoint members of a board and that the law impermissibly allowed defendant to name members to the board. The court held that the law required that appointments be made by plaintiff mayor. Although defendant council could nominate members, only plaintiff mayor could appoint them. The court further held that defendant had the authority to create investigatory bodies and grant them subpoena powers. The court also held that the board did not illegally infringe on plaintiff mayor's powers to implement systems of internal control or plaintiff district attorney's right to investigate and prosecute crimes.</SPAN></P>

The law clearly vests in the Mayor the power to appoint all five members of the Board, thereby obviating the need for a referendum which would have been required if the law had attempted to transfer or curtail the Mayor's appointment powers.  The law's appointment process, which grants defendant City Council the right to designate, but not appoint, two members of the Board, and further requires the Mayor to only consult with the Council's Speaker as to the appointment of the chairperson of the Board, does not deprive the Mayor of the ultimate right to appoint all of the Board members.  </SPAN></P>

Penal Law &sect; 240.35(2), defendant was convicted of loitering for the purpose of gambling with dice. Defendant filed an application to vacate the guilty verdict, pursuant to &sect; 330.30(1), arguing that &sect; 240.35(2) was unconstitutional and, therefore, reversal of the conviction was required as a matter of law. The court stated that, under &sect;&sect; 225.00(4) and (5), gambling was only illegal if a person advanced or profited from the gambling activity when acting other than a player. Therefore, persons who participated in gambling with dice as casual players did not commit a crime. The court stated that loitering for the purpose of gambling with dice did not constitute criminal behavior because gambling with dice, as a player, did not amount to criminal behavior. Consequently, the court held that &sect; 240.35(2) was unconstitutional because it prohibited loitering for the purpose of gambling with dice.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 240.35 (2), which provides that a person is guilty of loitering when he remains in a public place for the purpose of gambling with cards, dice or other gambling paraphernalia, is unconstitutional since gambling is not per se illegal; rather, gambling only becomes illegal if a person advances or profits from gambling activity, and does so other than as a player. Individuals who participate in gambling as casual players are not committing a crime.  Accordingly, inasmuch as casual gambling does not amount to criminal behavior, loitering for that purpose does not amount to criminal behavior, and although there is a strong presumption that a statute is constitutional and a nisi prius court should not ordinarily find a penal statute unconstitutional, this is a situation where such a conclusion is inescapable and the invalidity of the act is apparent on its face.  </SPAN></P>

The DOH based its action on alleged fraudulent filings by petitioner-plaintiff and, pending the outcome of its investigation, it did not pay petitioner-plaintiff's claims. After the filing of petitioner-plaintiff's action, it was indicted for Medicaid fraud, but the extent of its fraud was not determined. The court dismissed petitioner-plaintiff's action and vacated the restraining order against the DOH, which prohibited it from withholding more than 15 percent of the weekly Medicaid reimbursement payments to petitioner-plaintiff. The court found that the statute permitting withholding by the DOH of payments to a suspected fraudulent provider was not unconstitutional and the action of the DOH under that statute was not arbitrary, capricious or illegal as to petitioner but was proper under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Pursuant to 18 NYCRR 518.7 (d) (3), the Department of Health (DOH) may constitutionally withhold Medicaid reimbursement from Medicaid providers suspected of fraud where such withholding is requested by another State agency.  Although there is no express regulatory requirement that the outside agency render its investigatory determination within a specific time period, the mere absence of such time period does not render the regulation unconstitutional.  A Medicaid provider has no constitutionally protected property interest in being immediately paid for items that it bills, and it is not constitutionally entitled to full notice of the extent of its alleged fraud, an opportunity to respond to the charges, and a final administrative determination regarding the extent of its fraud before DOH may withhold payments pending a final determination. Constitutional due process will be met by a hearing at such time as the investigations are complete and the provider is given notice of the charges against it and an opportunity to respond, so long as that is within a reasonable period of time. The withholding of payments pending completion of a criminal investigation is a constitutionally permissible and eminently reasonable means of assuring some recoupment of losses resulting from fraudulent diversion of funds by Medicaid providers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health - Medicaid Reimbursement Payments - Withholding of Reimbursement Following Request by State Agency - Constitutionality of Regulation as Applied </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The Department of Health (DOH), acting pursuant to 18 NYCRR 518.7 (d) (3), did not unconstitutionally withhold Medicaid reimbursement from petitioner, a Medicaid provider suspected of fraud, where such withholding was requested by another State agency, and at the time the present proceeding challenging the constitutionality of the above regulation was commenced DOH had withheld a portion of the money that petitioner had expected for fewer than four months. Petitioner does not allege that respondents had completed their investigation, exonerated it or found that there was no basis for believing that it was guilty of fraud. Although petitioner has alleged that respondents failed to give notice of the withhold within five days or describe the reasons for the withhold, failed to state that the withholding is for a temporary period only, and failed to advise petitioner of the right to submit written arguments and documentation in opposition, petitioner has not demonstrated that any initial regulatory violation invalidates DOH's withholding and requires that the monies be returned to petitioner. Petitioner clearly is aware of its rights now and has adequate notice of the basis for the preliminary administrative action. Accordingly, petitioner is not entitled to return of the withheld money.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Pursuant to 18 NYCRR 518.7 (d) (3), the Department of Health (DOH) constitutionally withheld Medicaid reimbursement from Medicaid providers suspected of fraud where such withholding was requested by another State agency.  Although petitioner claims that respondents' actions are arbitrary and capricious, DOH is acting pursuant to the other respondents' request, and the other respondents are entities authorized to make such requests.  The other respondents have rendered no final determination and their actions are intended merely to ensure that there is some money available at such time as a final determination is rendered.  Petitioner has not demonstrated that there is no evidence of fraud or that respondents were acting for improper reasons, and therefore has failed to meet its burden to establish that respondents' determination was arbitrary, capricious, or illegal.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At criminal defendant's arraignment, defendant's counsel orally requested that the accusatory instrument be dismissed pursuant to N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another person were arrested on drug charges without a warrant. At the arraignment, pursuant to an oral request by defendant's counsel, the court found the accusatory instrument did not connect defendant with the drugs found near the other person, or even with the other person. When the people could not provide additional evidence to connect defendant to the crimes after being given an opportunity to do so, the court found that the accusatory instrument was insufficient on its face, and dismissed it pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc.  &sect;&sect; 140.40 and 140.45. The court held that because defendant was arrested without a warrant, the court had a duty to examine the instrument to determine its sufficiency at the arraignment. Because the statute did not require that a motion be filed in order to dismiss a warrantless accusatory instrument for insufficiency, because the people had an opportunity to present more evidence, and because the written motion procedures would have involved an unconstitutional delay of defendant's right to be released from custody, defendant did not need to file a motion in order to have the accusatory instrument dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the accusatory instrument as insufficient, because the people failed to provide a warrant showing probable cause, failed to allege sufficient facts either on the instrument, or at the arraignment, which could have provided a reasonable basis to find that defendant committed the crimes for which he was charged, and because the court could not delay defendant's release by requiring defendant to file a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

Where, as here, an accusatory instrument is filed in a local criminal court based upon a warrantless arrest, the court is required to inspect the accusatory instrument for facial sufficiency during the defendant's arraignment ( CPL 100.40) and since the court must inspect the instrument promptly after a warrantless arrest and exercise its dismissal power under CPL 140.45 in the event the pleading is defective, the People are not entitled to demand motion papers from the defendant or an opportunity to prepare a written response.  The People may present only such facts or evidence as may be available to them at the arraignment. CPL 140.45 does not, by its express terms, require any application by the defendant. The statute simply commands the court to dismiss when an instrument has been filed that is facially insufficient and the available facts reveal no possibility that the pleading can be redeemed.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that petitioner's provision of necessities to its members was not inurement of profits to disqualify it for a tax exemption for its real property used to further its articulated purposes.

The provision by petitioner to its members of food, clothing, shelter, medical care and other necessities and ordinaries of life does not constitute a pecuniary profit inuring to petitioner's members such as to result in petitioner's disqualification for a tax exemption under RPTL 420-a (1) (b) in view of petitioner's commitment to a communal and classless way of life for its members as a matter of articulated religious principle rather than a de facto arrangement of convenience or mere social utility.  Likewise, the fact that petitioner generates substantial profits through its manufacturing operations does not result in petitioner's disqualification to receive a tax exemption since all such profits are used in conformity with statutorily permitted purposes.  Moreover, the statute would be unconstitutional if applied to deny a tax exemption to petitioner for its real property used in furtherance of its religious purposes since such an application would be an invalid discrimination by government with respect to the exercise of religion. </SPAN></P>

Penal Law &sect; 225.00(2), if a person engaged in gambling was in New York, then New York was the location where the gambling occurred. As a result, respondents were subject to personal jurisdiction in New York and the trial court denied their motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that respondents were subject to personal jurisdiction in New York because they had offices there, used the Internet to conduct business with New York residents, and worked there with a New York company to design graphics for their Internet gambling site.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The Attorney General may maintain a special proceeding pursuant to Executive Law &sect; 63 (12) to enjoin respondents, a foreign corporation legally licensed to operate a casino offshore and its subsidiaries and officers, from offering gambling to Internet users in New York in violation of New York's prohibition against unauthorized gambling activity (NY Const, art I, &sect; 9 [1]; Penal Law &sect; 225.05).  Respondents are subject to personal jurisdiction in New York for purposes of this proceeding since they purposefully engaged in significant activities such that they availed themselves of the privilege of conducting business in this State.  Respondents maintained offices in New York and used the Internet to conduct business with New York residents. Respondents also worked with a New York company to design the graphics for their Internet gambling site. Furthermore, the court has subject matter jurisdiction over this proceeding.  Internet gambling falls within the scope of New York's gambling prohibitions.  Even though gambling is legal where the bet was accepted, the act of entering the bet and transmitting the information from New York via the Internet is adequate to constitute illegal gambling activity within New York.  A computer server cannot be permitted to function as a shield against liability, particularly where respondents actively targeted New York as the location where they conducted many of their allegedly illegal activities.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a special proceeding brought by the Attorney General pursuant to Executive Law &sect; 63 (12), respondents, a foreign corporation legally licensed to operate a casino offshore, and its subsidiaries and officers, are enjoined from offering gambling to Internet users in New York.  Even though gambling is legal where the bet was accepted, the act of entering the bet and transmitting the information from New York via the Internet is adequate to constitute illegal gambling activity within New York.  By having established the gambling enterprise and solicited users in New York to gamble through their gambling web site, respondents have illegally promoted gambling in New York in violation of Penal Law &sect; 225.05.  In addition, respondents' interstate use of the Internet to conduct their illegal gambling business also violates Federal laws proscribing gambling, such as the Wire Act (18 USC &sect; 1084 [a]), the Travel Act (18 USC &sect; 1952), and the Wagering and Paraphernalia Act (18 USC &sect; 1953). The Federal statutes apply to the operation of an offshore casino. The Interstate Commerce Clause gives Congress the plenary power to regulate gambling conducted between a location in the United States and a foreign location.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General - Enjoining Fraudulent or Illegal Acts - Securities Fraud - Sales of Stock in Internet Gambling Business </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In an action brought by the Attorney General pursuant to Executive Law &sect; 63 (12), respondents, a foreign corporation legally licensed to operate a casino offshore, and its subsidiaries and officers, are enjoined from continuing their fraudulent and illegal sales of stock in their Internet gambling business to prospective investors in New York.  Respondents are operating illegally in New York by failing to have applied to the Department of State for approval to do business in New York despite operating out of offices located in New York.  In addition, respondents violated the Martin Act (General Business Law &sect; 359-e [1] [a]) by selling units of stock from their New York offices without registering with the Attorney General.  Respondents also violated the Martin Act's prohibition against the use of deception, misrepresentations, or concealment in the sale of securities (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;General Business Law &sect; 352 [1]) by failing to disclose that approximately 46% of the investors' funds were used to pay respondents' commissions, salaries, and consulting fees.  Moreover, each individual respondent is liable for the actions conducted by the corporate entities.  As part of the injunctive relief, respondents will be required to post a bond to assure future proper behavior.  Furthermore, an award for restitution, penalties and costs is warranted in an amount to be fixed at a hearing.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner father filed a motion under N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 720(2) (1962), to have respondent, his daughter, adjudged a person in need of supervision (PINS). Petitioner claimed that respondent continually absconded from the custody of the Commissioner of Social Services in violation of court orders. After 10 warrants were issued for respondent's arrest, the city filed a motion under N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect;&sect; 304.1(2), (3) (1962) to have respondent detained in a secure facility. The city alleged that detention was warranted because respondent committed an act that, if committed by an adult, would constitute criminal contempt in the second degree under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 215.50(3). The court granted the city's motion and adjudged respondent a juvenile delinquent under N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 352.1, holding that due to her continued disregard for the court's orders that she appear, respondent required supervision, treatment, or confinement. The court dismissed petitioner's motion as a result of its decision to grant the city's motion, and because N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 720(2) specifically proscribed detention of juveniles determined to be PINS.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Family court dismissed petitioner's motion under the New York Family Court Act to have respondent, his daughter, adjudicated a person in need of supervision (PINS). The court explained that it granted the city's motion to have respondent detained instead because respondent continually ignored the court's orders that she appear and required supervision and confinement, and the law under which petitioner filed his motion proscribed detention.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Infants - Persons in Need of Supervision - Need for Secure Detention </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a person in need of supervision (PINS) proceeding in which respondent juvenile has continually absconded from the custody of the Commissioner of Social Services in violation of Family Court's remand orders, respondent is adjudged to be a juvenile delinquent for having engaged in intentional disobedience to lawful process or other court mandates (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 215.50 [3]), and is remanded to secure detention, since the statutory scheme does not provide for any secure detention in PINS proceedings (Family Ct Act &sect; 720).  Family Court Act &sect; 720, which, for pecuniary reasons only, prohibits Family Court from ordering secure detention in a PINS proceeding under any and all circumstances whether by way of preventive detention or dispositional order, may unconstitutionally deprive needy children of equal protection of the laws by depriving the court of the power to remand to an appropriate setting when necessary to accomplish the rehabilitative and nonpunitive policy underlying PINS proceedings. Although the statutory prohibition against secure detention in PINS proceedings was primarily intended to insure continued Federal funding under provisions of the Federal Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (Pub L 93-415) regarding preventive detention and dispositional orders in PINS proceedings, the Federal law specifically authorizes secure detention for PINS children who violate a valid order of the court and does not demand a total prohibition in order for the State to obtain Federal funding (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;42 USC &sect; 5633 [a] [12] [A]). In addition, the statutory prohibition is violative of the inherent powers doctrine.  The Legislature, having granted Family Court exclusive original subject matter jurisdiction over PINS proceedings, cannot deprive Family Court of the power to enforce, implement and effect the policy and goals inherent in that subject matter jurisdiction. </SPAN></P>
