The trial court awarded judgment to PERA and this decision was affirmed by the court. Generally, an official charged with the performance of a ministerial duty was not allowed to question the constitutionality of a law under which it was charged to act.

Stat. &sect; 124.51 provided a method for taxation, collection, and payment of tuition by school districts not maintaining classified secondary schools.

The court referred to other holdings concerning the uniformity clause that stated that perfect uniformity and perfect equality of taxation was impossible and not the goal. Uniformity did not require the equal application of a tax to all who might come within its operation. The statute was entitled to respect from the judiciary because the statute's predecessor had been given a similar construction by the attorney general, the department of education, and the public examiner has been consistent since 1947.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action in the Dakota County District Court brought by Joseph A. Adelman and Joseph W. Kennealy, individually and as representatives of all persons in said county owning land in the Lower Minnesota River Watershed District, to enjoin the county auditor, the county board, and said watershed district from proceeding with certain improvements.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant watershed district sought review of a decision of the Dakota County District Court (Minnesota), which granted respondent landowners' injunction that enjoined the watershed district from proceeding further in carrying out a planned improvement of a portion of the Minnesota River.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners contended that the Minnesota Watershed Act, Minn. Stat. ch. 112, was unconstitutional and sought an injunction enjoining the watershed district from proceeding with a project to improve the Minnesota River channel. The trial court granted the injunction and enjoined the watershed district from doing any act in connection with the levy, collection, or enforcement of assessments. The trial court held that the Minnesota Watershed Act was unconstitutional because it was vague, ambiguous, discriminatory, and inconsistent and was incapable of any reasonable interpretation or enforcement. On appeal, the court found that the landowners had several opportunities to assert their objections to the creation of the district and to the assessments levied for the channel-improvement project. Any proceedings in equity thereafter were untimely. Failure to exhaust available administrative remedies in a timely manner when those remedies were simple, direct, and expedient constituted a bar to an unseasonable action in equity. It could not be said that the opportunities for the landowners to raise objections were either impractical or inadequate.</SPAN></P>

Olson, and M. J. Gjertson, d.b.a. Gjertson Farm Supply.  The cases were heard together before L. J. Irvine, Judge, and appellant appealed from an order affirming the commission.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant railway company disputed an order of the Cottonwood County District Court (Minnesota), which affirmed three orders by the Railroad and Warehouse Commission (Minnesota) fixing rents on properties owned by the company and leased to respondent lessees. The main issue was whether the Commission had jurisdiction under any or all of Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 230.09, 230.10, 230.11 to fix the level of rents to be paid for the leased properties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">All three properties were separated from the main railroad tracks by a city street. One of the lessees, a lumberyard, received only cement goods via rail. Its other shipments were by truck. Another lessee made rare use of railroad facilities. The third lessee's business had declined and it was no longer feasible for that lessee to order in freight carload shipments. On appeal, the court held that it was intended that railroad properties subject to rent-control jurisdiction by the Commission be devoted to a public use. The power granted by &sect;&sect; 230.09, 230.10, 230.11 was in the nature of eminent domain and, as such, could only be exercised under Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 where the expropriation was for a public use. To preserve the constitutionality of the statutes, the court construed them as including that qualification. Thus, property taken under the statutes had to be open to members of the general public to aid them in shipping and receiving their own goods, which requirement the lessees did not meet. The court held that &sect;&sect; 230.09, 230.10, 230.11 were not intended to apply to cases such as the one at bar. Nor could the leased properties be considered part of the right of way.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed with directions to enter an order vacating and setting aside the order of the Commission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed an ordinance that compelled all contractors performing work for the city to employ only county residents, which included residents of the city. The employees were required to obtain from the city clerk a resident identification card which certified that he was a resident of the county. The sanction imposed against a contractor who violated the requirement was the loss of his contract. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the union local, and on appeal, the court affirmed. Under the city's charter, the activity of laborers was a statewide matter and not one for local regulation so long as the activity was not inherently dangerous to the health, welfare, safety, or morals of the people of the city. The ordinance was partial and discriminatory both upon its face and in its operation for, by its very terms, the performance of the occupation of a laborer was permitted in the city if he lived in the county but was prohibited to him if he lived elsewhere. The ordinance was, in so far as it discriminated between resident and nonresident citizens, unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

The Commissioner dismissed the patrolman for the willful violation of a work rule under the authority granted to him by Minn. Stat. 161.47 Subd. 8(2). Before the lower court, the patrolman introduced evidence that other officers routinely received less punishment for more serious violations. The lower court ordered that the patrolman's dismissal be vacated and that his punishment be reduced to a suspension. The court reversed the lower court's order, holding that the lower court's function was to ascertain whether there was any substantial evidence supporting the Commissioner's decision, not to arrive at an independent conclusion pertaining to the propriety of the discipline imposed by the Commissioner. The court ruled that by substituting its judgment for that of the Commissioner, the lower court had violated Minn.

He was carrying a loaded pistol and a two-way radio, and gloves and a flashlight were found nearby. Just before he was caught, he was heard to use the radio to give a warning to another person. Inside the building, damage was discovered to a narcotics vault, and another two-way radio, a punch, a sledge hammer, and a crowbar were found. On appeal, in addition to other issues determined by the court to be without substance, defendant objected to an instruction that told the jury that possession of tools was prima facie evidence of intent and that explained prima facie evidence in terms of a mandatory presumption. The court reversed the order, holding that an instruction as to a presumptions of law that directed a jury to draw an inference was impermissible in a criminal case. Although the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to permit an inference of intent, the instruction improperly required the jury to find in accordance with the presumption. When specific intent was an essential element of an offense, it was never to be presumed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating a city ordinance prohibiting parking on a city street for more than two hours between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., unless otherwise designated. On review, he attacked the ordinance by arguing that two other provisions of the ordinance, prohibiting parking on public streets between the hours of 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m., were invalid because there was no valid purpose and that residents living in the city had no other place to park their cars. The court held that it was unnecessary to consider the constitutionality of the other provisions because defendant was not charged with violating them. Section 411.131(c) served the valid public purpose of permitting free passage of vehicles on a public highway. No constitutional violation occurred merely because no signs were posted warning motorists. The public was presumed to know the traffic laws, and the absence of signs was not an impediment to the valid enforcement of the parking ordinance in question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the court was whether the police officer's compulsory retirement at age 65 under Minn.

The police officer's only claim was that he was accorded unconstitutional treatment under an otherwise valid statute as he was required to retire while others similarly situated had been permitted to remain employed on different payrolls, i.e. administrative, police and fire alarm, parks, and playgrounds payrolls. He argued that the classification by payroll was arbitrary and unreasonable. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that a valid classification did not depend on ironclad uniformity. The fact that measures taken were not directed at all of the evils to be corrected did not invalidate the application of the statute as the state was dealing with the problem of officers retiring from hazardous duty at age 65 according to practical exigencies and experience in a manner that was germane to its solution. There was no evidence in the record that the police officer was qualified for any available nonhazardous duty.</SPAN></P>

Several appeals followed and new ordinances were proposed in order to allow the developer to erect the sign. The city still voted to deny the developer's application. The trial court determining that the city's action in denying the permit was arbitrary, capricious, and in violation of the developer's rights and ordered the permit issued. The court determined that the city had the authority to regulate the use, size, and position of business signs. However, the court reasoned that the regulations must bear a reasonable relation to the purpose that they were meant for. The court held that it would not overrule the trial court's finding that the city's denial of the sign did not reasonably relate to the purposes of the ordinances. The court stated that the city's denial was based solely on a violation of the ordinance and that was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1924, the mining company entered into a 50-year lease with the state to mine iron ore in a lake bed. Starting in 1943, litigation continued for 15 years. In 1958, pursuant to a final judgment, the mining company submitted a claim to the commissioner of conservation for a refund of royalties under a mineral lease after the action determined that the state had no title to the land. The commissioner denied the claim. The mining company petitioned, and the trial court issued a writ of certiorari against the commissioner and the state auditor to review the claim. The state filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court quashed the writ as to the auditor, but the trial court vacated the commissioner's disapproval of the claim and remanded the claim to the commissioner. The commissioner appealed. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, ordering the refund. The court determined that the state did not own the mineral rights, that the lease provided for refunds if the state were determined not to own the rights, and that title to the property was not finally determined until 1958, so laches and other theories did not preclude recovery by the mining company.</SPAN></P>

Also, &sect; 105.42 was not unconstitutional vague and did not unconstitutionally interfere with the property rights of riparian owners.

The trial court held that all stock dividends, with the exception of 10 shares of an oil corporation, should have been allocated to principal with the aforementioned 10 shares allocated to income. The life beneficiary challenged the trial court's assignment of dividends to the principal. The court held that application of Minn. Stat. &sect; 501.47 retroactively to a trust created prior to its enactment was not violative of the constitutional rights of income beneficiaries of such trust. The court concluded that where capital dividends were distributed by a regulated investment company and received by the trustee at his option either in cash or in shares of the investment fund, such capital gain dividends constituted income and were to be distributed to the income beneficiary.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the statute did not set forth all of the elements necessary to constitute the offense intended to be punished, so the information, which simply followed the words of the statute, was not sufficient.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment awarded the wife accrued alimony, support payments, and attorney's fees based on the divorce decree, which gave the wife custody of the parties' child, ordered child support, and ordered monthly alimony and attorney fees. In addition, the judgment declared the husband to be in contempt for failure to make the payments when due and sentenced him to 60 days in the county jail with execution stayed for 15 days to give him an opportunity to purge himself of contempt by making payments to the wife. The husband failed to make the payments. The court first held that, in so far as the judgment incorporated the delinquent child support, reversal was compelled because the district court did not have jurisdiction to enforce by contempt proceedings the payment of delinquent support money because the child had reached majority. Furthermore, apart from the overdue child support, the record failed to sustain an essential finding to the effect that the husband was able to make the payments required by the judgment. Such a finding was necessary before the husband could be found in contempt. Therefore, the judgment was reversed, and the matter remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 622.06, which defined grand larceny in the second degree, was unconstitutional under Minn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 5, or U.S. Const. amends. V or XIV, &sect; 1. Pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 632.10, the district court certified the resulting questions to the court as &quot;important&quot; or &quot;doubtful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants claimed that Minn. Stat. &sect; 622.06 was unconstitutional because it imposed cruel and unusual punishment contrary to Minn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 5; deprived them of life, liberty, and property without due process of law, contrary to U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV; and was so uncertain of meaning that it could not be reasonably understood by a person of ordinary intelligence. The court answered the three questions certified to it under &sect; 632.10 in the negative. The court rejected the cruel and unusual punishment claim. Even though an amendment to &sect; 622.06 had created an anomaly under which penalties for more serious thefts were actually less onerous than those imposed for thefts of lesser magnitude, the anomaly might work to defendants' advantage but, in any event, the statutory penalty was not unconstitutional. Nor were defendants deprived of equal protection because the legislature was entitled to classify crimes and prescribe punishment based on the value of the stolen property. Finally, the court found no merit to defendants' claim that the statute was unclear; the anomaly did not affect its clarity, only the relationship between offenses and penalties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the larceny statute did not violate state or federal proscriptions against cruel or unusual punishment, that the statute did not violate defendants' equal protection rights, and that the statute was not void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

The appeal also constituted a direct attack upon the constitutionality of Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Landowners contended that the taking of an easement on their land by a creamery association constituted a taking of private property for private purposes and violated Minn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 13, and that it constituted a denial to them of due process of law in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1.While conceding that they did not serve notice of appeal on the attorney general, the landowners contended that condemnation actions were &quot;special proceedings&quot; to which the Rules of Civil Procedure did not apply by reason of Minn. R. Civ. P. 81.01 and Appendix A. On appeal, the court did not find any such inconsistencies or conflicts. The court held that while the eminent domain proceeding in the case may have had the aspect of &quot;special proceedings&quot; at the outset, nevertheless, even though no appeal was taken from the viewers' award, the appeal from the judgment entered pursuant thereto became adversary and judicial in nature, making the Rules of Civil Procedure applicable. Therefore, because the appeal directly challenged the constitutionality of Minn. St. 308.39 and notice of the appeal was not served upon the attorney general, the appeal had to be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The court held; (1) the new zoning ordinance had no valid relationship to issues of public welfare, health, or safety; (2) the zoning ordinances as they related to landowner's property rendered it practically valueless; and (3) the city's actions in denying the landowners the right to use their property in the same manner permitted for other properties in the area constituted a complete and willful disregard of the trial court's initial decision.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the decision of the Industrial Commission was amply supported by the evidence and that it engaged in a reasonable exercise of judgment. The court found no denial of due process of law with respect to advisory board hearings. Moreover, the court found no unlawful discrimination in the resulting wage classifications, including the one in dispute, involving food service employees who worked in retail stores and drugstores.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the trial court correctly held that the trustee could deduct from gross receipts a reasonable amount annually as depreciation of the property of the trust in determining net income. The settlor created an inter vivos trust in which her husband and a holding company were trustees. They were later divorced, and the children sought to remove the husband as trustee. The trustee son was appointed successor trustee, and he took a depreciation deduction of the cost value of property, both for income tax purposes and trust purposes, in determining net income available for distribution. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision in favor of the trustee. The court adopted the rule that, where depreciable buildings were acquired with trust funds after creation of the trust, the trustee could deduct from the gross receipts as an expense item an amount equal to the reasonable estimated depreciation of the cost value of the property. The settlor intended the corpus of the trust to remain intact for income beneficiaries and the ultimate remaindermen. If the buildings in question were depreciable, the only way to accomplish that intent was to permit the deduction.</SPAN></P>

The trial court increased defendant's sentence based upon his prior felony convictions pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 610.29. The inmate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and the district court denied the petition. On appeal, the inmate asserted that the statute under which he was convicted was invalid because the state legislature had not redistricted the state as a basis for legislative representation as required by Minn. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 2, 23, and 24. The court held that a mere change in relative population and the consequent inequality of representation did not render a law enacted by the legislature void and did not make it necessary to set aside criminal convictions under such laws. The court affirmed the judgment denying the writ of habeas corpus. The court noted that the inmate could have received a life sentence based upon his three prior felony convictions pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 610.29. The court held that there was nothing in the record to establish that either the proceedings, the judgment of conviction, or the sentence imposed were invalid.</SPAN></P>

The school boards of the unorganized territory and of Independent School District No. 115 were permitted to intervene.  Plaintiff appealed (No. 38,350) from an order, John T. Galarneault, Judge, declaring the statute unconstitutional but refusing to invalidate acts already performed thereunder and certifying the questions presented to be important and doubtful.  This appeal was consolidated with an appeal (No. 38,351) by Russell Lego, Robert Williams, and Art Combs from another order by said judge denying their motion for summary judgment in appeals they had taken from certain orders of said county superintendent.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superintendent sought to consolidate a part of the unorganized county with existing school districts. The individuals sought a restraining order to prevent the superintendent from issuing that order. The order was initially granted by the trial court, which the court reversed. The individuals then filed a supplemental complaint seeking to have 1957 Minn. Laws 730 declared unconstitutional. The trial court held that 1957 Minn. Laws 730 was unconstitutional but that acts performed by the Board under 1957 Minn. Laws 730 prior to its determination of unconstitutionality were valid. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision. The court held the fact that the Act applied to only one county was not enough to invalidate it if there were other reasonable grounds for placing that county in a class by itself. The court found that the act was necessary for the county because the population was not dense enough to warrant the formation of a school district. The court recognized that unique problems were involved in the management of schools in unorganized territory in counties having large areas and that the classification caused by the act was therefore justified.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 617.24 (later repealed by 1961 Minn. Laws 664).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the terms &quot;obscene&quot; and &quot;indecent&quot; in the information were so vague and indefinite that they failed to comply with the requirements for terminology in criminal informations. On appeal, the court construed the statutory language such that the definition of the crime was instinct with the idea of scienter. A reading of &sect; 617.24 as a whole clearly indicated that only those who were in some manner aware of the character of the material they attempted to distribute should be punished. It was not innocent but calculated purveyance of filth that was exorcised. Further, no statute should be declared unconstitutional if by any reasonable construction it could be given a meaning in harmony with the fundamental law. The court also held that the words &quot;obscene or indecent&quot; as used in &sect; 617.24 were not unconstitutionally indefinite in violation of the federal and state constitutions. The new statute, 1961 Minn. Laws 664, although not retroactive, was indicative of the legislature's intent in enacting &sect; 617.24. The court rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 617.24 was ambiguous. Section 617.24 could be construed as not imposing strict criminal liability upon an accused.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">From an examination of the authorities and the record, the court concluded that the representatives were without legal capacity to maintain their suit and that the summary judgment was properly ordered. The court observed that the attorney general could not bind the state by his appearance in the action so as to give the court jurisdiction of the Association or the board representing that agency in the absence of a statute. The representatives had no private contractual or vested right in the Association's pension granted by the government except as payments became due under law. As the pension plan arrangement was statutory, and the members had no vested contractual rights, the appeal presented no case of an unconstitutional impairment of contract rights. Thus, this was not a representative suit. The public employees retirement board's action taken on behalf of the secretary gave rise to the presumption that the secretary acted in good faith in the performance of his duty pursuant to the regulations adopted by the board in so far as the fraud charge was concerned. Lack of subject matter jurisdiction was a question of law suitable for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted a modified a model milk ordinance that was developed by the United States Public Health Service. Instead of a bacterial count of 200,000 per liter as permitted by the model ordinance, the city required a bacterial level of 170,000 per liter. The city's ordinance imposed the obligation of procuring a license on those selling milk and set the cost of a license based on the seller's distance from city hall. The city required no fewer than two inspections of each seller's dairy per year. The trial court found against the dairy, and the court reversed. Scientific testimony established that the difference in bacterial counts between the two ordinances was scientifically insignificant. In addition, there was no claim that milk inspected under the model ordinance in other cities was unwholesome. The court found that the more city's rigid requirement bacterial count requirement exceeded its police power because it went beyond the reasonable demands of the occasion. There was no public health benefit to the city's more rigid ordinance controlling production and pasteurization of milk. The ordinance adversely affected the dairy's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

The driver commenced an action to recover for his personal injuries. The jury awarded a verdict to the driver, but the trial court granted the railroad a JNOV. The driver appealed, arguing that (1) that he was deprived of his constitutional right to a trial by jury by virtue of the court's order granting JNOV; (2) contributory negligence was improperly asserted as a defense; and (3) the railroad failed to warn the driver regarding a defective or extrahazardous crossing. The court held that the trial court's grant of a JNOV to the railroad did not deprive the driver of his right to a jury trial. While the railroad crossing was under repair, the driver admitted that the condition of the crossing did not contribute to the collision. The collision was caused by the driver's failure to observe an approaching train, which was plainly visible if he had looked. While a view of the approaching train was somewhat obstructed by the cut through which the track ran, it was obvious from the driver's own testimony that, if he had looked, he would have seen the train.

It further reasoned that defendants had enjoyed the benefits of the laws of Minnesota and had had access to its courts to enforce any rights in regard to the transactions involved; that the actions grew directly out of the relationships of the parties created in Minnesota; and that considering the factors bearing on traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice, it was clear that defendants' burden of defending in Minnesota was no greater than would be plaintiff's burden of suing in Oregon.</SPAN></P>

The State contended that injunctive relief should be available under the statute on a simple showing of threatened injury to a competitor without requiring proof of the purpose or effect of the allegedly illegal sales. The court rejected the argument, holding that the statute prohibited only below-cost sales with the purpose or effect of harming competition. Thus, the court held that the State was required to meet its prima facie burden on the element before issuance of an injunction. Examining the evidence, the court held that the burden had not been met and vacated the injunction.

The court found that statutes requiring security, as a prerequisite to an appeal, existed in Minnesota since the origin of its state governments and that, where other challenges had taken place, it was universally held that such statutes were not unconstitutional.

He had been convicted of the murder of his mother and the conviction was reversed because of defective juvenile proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, age 16 years at the time of the crime, killed his mother, father, brother, and sister. He was tried as an adult for the murder of his mother and received life imprisonment as a sentence. The indictments against him for the other murders were dismissed. Seventeen years later, his writ of habeas corpus was granted and his conviction was void because of the failure to use proper juvenile proceedings in transferring his case to adult district court. The state then re-indicted him for the murders and the judge certified certain questions to the court. One question was whether defendant could be retried for the murder of his mother on the original indictment. The court held that the district court had jurisdiction to try him at the original trial because he was now over the age of 18 years of age and no longer had the status of a juvenile, and the previous proceeding against him did not constitute former jeopardy because the court which tried him lacked jurisdiction. The court held that his failure to demand a speedy trial constituted a waiver of that right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Review of the issue constituted a direct attack on the legal existence of the Board of Education of the Unorganized Territory of Cass County. With clarification, the court denied the petition. The court held that the question could not be reviewed on an appeal under Minn. Stat. Ann. &sect; 122.051, subd. 1, because the scope of review under that section was limited to the matters that were enumerated therein. Also, according to the court, to raise the constitutional issue on that appeal would have constituted a collateral attack upon the corporate existence, which was not permissible. However, the court held that plaintiff could have a review pursuant to Minn. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 555.01, 555.11 of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, or Minn. Stat. Ann. &sect; 556.01, which provided for an action to prevent the usurpation of office. Also, the court held that a writ of quo warranto could be available to him pursuant to Minn. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plats for the disputed consolidation had been adopted and approved by the boards of education of the unorganized territory and of each of the affected school districts before the superintendent was served with a temporary restraining order enjoining her from issuing the consolidation order. The district court refused to grant a declaratory judgment, but it issued the temporary injunction under Minn. Stat. Ann. &sect; 585.02. The court reversed its order. An injunction was not to issue where there was an adequate remedy at law. The taxpayer had such a remedy in Minn. Stat. Ann. &sect; 122.051, subd. 1, providing for a direct appeal from a consolidation order in which the merits of such an order could be tested. The remedy of appeal was not inadequate even if the taxpayer was correct that the consolidation proceeding depended upon an unconstitutional statute because operation of the order was suspended by such an appeal and an automatic stay followed. Therefore, no substantial and irreparable injury resulted from denial of the injunction. Injunction was not appropriate before the issuance of the order when there was a right of appeal and taking the appeal precluded substantial injury.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 1, &sect; 13 even though the land was to be sold to private persons. The taking of the land was for the purpose of eliminating the blighted area, which was a public purpose. Once the blighted area is cleared, the public purpose is accomplished. The subsequent sale to private persons is merely incidental to the public purpose and is not prohibited. The court held that the landowner's due process rights were not violated by any alleged lack of notice because the landowner had a full hearing on the issue of the reasonableness and the purpose for which the property was taken. The court also held that the trial court properly determined that the correct date for determining damages was the date of taking, which was the date the housing and redevelopment authority deposited the money for the taking with the clerk of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Based on a reclassification to residential, the building inspector denied the owners' application. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The court found that the owners were denied a permit to erect a commercial building on premises which at the time of their purchase were zoned commercial because two-thirds of the adjacent property owners had instituted proceedings to empower the city council to rezone the owners' property from commercial to residential. The court held that a purchaser of real property was entitled to place some reliance on zoning ordinances which had classified the property being purchased. The court held that the consent clause of &sect; 462.18, as a prerequisite to the exercise of the city council's legislative authority to amend the comprehensive zoning ordinance, constituted an unlawful delegation of power to impose restrictions on real property and rendered the provision of the statute invalid.</SPAN></P>

The evidence sustained the trial court's finding as to the reasonable value of material and labor contributed by plaintiffs. The builders did not violate Minn. Stat.

There was no ground for estoppel based on the landowners' claim that the builders proceeded with the work knowing that the landowners insisted throughout that the cost could not exceed $ 28,000. Because the attorneys' fees allowance was determined on an erroneous basis, a new trial on that issue was required.

The court also held that certifying a union without holding an election was a reasonable exercise of the conciliator's power under &sect; 179.16, subd. 2 and that &sect; 179.16, subd. 2 did not unconstitutionally delegate legislative power to the conciliator because he was clearly required to decide representation questions in a way that insured that the employees would have received the full benefit of their right to self-organization and to collective bargaining and because the right to judicial review fully protected interested parties from arbitrary and capricious action.</SPAN></P>

The voters' affidavits alleged that certain signers of the certificate had voted in the primary election and other signatures were forged. Under Minn. Stat.

In anticipation of the opening of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence waterway, the Minnesota Legislature adopted 1957 Minn.

Laws 849 related to state aid, 1957 Minn. Laws 831 related to county aid, and 1957 Minn. Laws 849 related to city aid. The court held that the purposes for which the port authority was established involved the establishment of an agency of the State of Minnesota for the administration of a purely governmental function and that, therefore, the laws authorizing public taxation for the improvement of the port facilities were for a public purpose under Minn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether additional payments of compensation were to be made under the law which was in effect at the time that the employees died, Minn.

Under the former statute the special compensation fund would pay, under the latter statute the employer and insurer would pay. The court reversed and held that 1951 Minn. Laws, c. 457, &sect; 6 was unconstitutional as it purported to apply to employees who died before the effective date of the statute. Since the workmen's compensation act was contractual in nature, any statute which purported to alter a substantial term of the contract, which was in effect at the time the controlling event occurred (the death of the employee in these cases) impaired the obligation of such contract and was unconstitutional. The rights of the claimants, therefore, to benefits of the special compensation fund were not destroyed by the enactment of 1951 Laws, c. 457, &sect; 6 because the circumstances of the cases all came within the purview of the amended act.</SPAN></P>

The school house was built, but after several years of service, was discontinued, and the property was sold to defendant purchasers. In the meantime, plaintiffs approached the heirs of the prior owners and induced them to sell their interest in the property to plaintiffs. Thereafter, plaintiffs instituted an action against defendants contending that the cessation of the original purpose of the property and its ultimate sale resulted in a reversion of the property to the heirs of the prior owners, thus their purchased interest superceded that of defendants. The trial court agreed and returned a judgment in favor of plaintiffs, and defendants appealed the decision. The court held, using the applicable rules of statutory construction, that Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.023 could not have been construed to protect old interests in property properly sold. Therefore, the judgment in favor of plaintiffs was improper as against public policy.</SPAN></P>

The tax under Minn. Stat. Ann. &sect; 290.03 related to income derived solely from the interstate business of the taxpayer, a foreign corporation, conducted in the State. The taxpayer contended that it did not have sufficient contacts with the State to make it subject to jurisdiction, that &sect; 290.03 was in conflict with the Due Process Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, and the Commerce Clause. On appeal, the court held that the taxpayer was subject to jurisdiction of the trial court because the taxpayer maintained an office in the State, employed persons in the State, and solicited orders in the State. As to the due process claim, the court found that the imposition of a net-income tax under &sect; 290.03 upon that portion of the taxpayer's net income that was allocated to Minnesota under the three-factor formula of &sect; 290.19 was not unconstitutional as violating due process. Further, the tax imposed was not in contravention of the Commerce Clause since it did not impose a burden upon, or discriminate against, interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

The inmate was proceeded against in district court in the same manner as anyone. He pled guilty to murder in the second degree. The inmate contended that the district court was without jurisdiction to proceed against him because proceedings held by the juvenile court were defective and that court was therefore without jurisdiction. The court reversed the judgment, finding that the intent of the legislature was clearly to require proceedings under the Juvenile Court Act prior to a proceeding in district court. Further, the court found that there was no conflict with Minn. Const. art. 6, &sect; 5 in requiring a proper proceeding under Minn. Stat. Ann. ch. 260 prior to the district court's exercise of criminal jurisdiction. Additionally, the court found that the inmate's mother was not given notice of the juvenile proceedings as required under Minn. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Township of Chanhassen sought review of the judgment of the Carver County District Court (Minnesota), which held that the township's zoning ordinance was unconstitutional. The judgment complained of was rendered in plaintiff business owners' action alleging that after he lost his property through eminent domain, the ordinance subjected him to a possible fine for continuing a lawnmower business not authorized under the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The township enacted a zoning ordinance that limited land use to residential, farming, and other agricultural pursuits and did not permit industrial uses in the owner's area. The owners' lawnmower business was allowed as a nonconforming use, but the initial business site was later taken by the state through condemnation. The owners, wishing to continue the business, sought a rezoning of the area but the township denied the request, indicating however, that they could rebuild and operate the shop elsewhere on their property. The owners did so and were not interfered with in their business. The owners filed the instant action alleging that the ordinance subjected them to potential fines for conducting a nonauthorized use. The trial court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional and the township appealed. The court found that the ordinance was constitutional as an exercise of the township's police powers, but held that inasmuch as the ordinance would deny the owners the right to continue their business, it constituted an unreasonable police regulation restricting the right of use of the owners' property for business purposes contrary to the provisions of U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment as to the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance. The court modified the judgment so as to provide judgment for the owners in accordance with its opinion that where condemnation resulted in the taking of land on which the owners conducted a nonconforming use under local ordinance, the taking did not give effect to the prohibition in the ordinance so as to deprive the owners of the right to continue their use.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court concluded that the right of the signers to withdraw their names from the petition ceased to exist the moment the board exercised any action in reliance upon the jurisdiction conferred by the petition. Further, the alleged ultimatum of the enlarged school district that it would not accept non-resident students in the absence of a merger could not have affected the jurisdiction of the board in its decision to merge and was both immaterial and ineffective to invalidate the board's action.</SPAN></P>

The landowners argued that the proposed taking of their land was unnecessary and that it was not for a public use as required by U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Minn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 13. The landowners also alleged that 1955 Minn. Laws 757, amending Minn. Stat. Ann. &sect; 308.05, was unconstitutional as applied to the cooperative. Upon review, the court concluded that the taking was for a public use because the cooperative acted as a public utility. The court determined that 1955 Minn.

The trial court could not find facts but was limited to reviewing the board's findings of facts. This had to be done by way of a writ of certiorari from the board's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The committee argued that the laws creating the commission, 1943 Minn. Laws 500 and L. 1951 Minn. Laws 72, violated the federal and state constitutions, that the commission's acts were similarly unconstitutional, that the commission did not comply with Minn. Stat. Ann. &sect; 360.124 in determining whether the airport should be used by jet aircraft, and that the commissions' findings were not supported by the evidence. The court disagreed. The fact that no resident of Anoka County could serve on the board of governors was not unconstitutional. Providing a unified, integrated, centralized system of air traffic control was a proper exercise of the state's police power, and residents of Anoka County were represented in the legislature. The evidence supported the commission's determinations of factual matters required to be considered under &sect; 360.124. Moreover, it was not the court's function to substitute its judgment for the commission's judgment. The evidence also showed substantial compliance with the Doolittle report, which, in any event, was not mandatory directive. The committee's objections appeared to be based more on an apprehension than on the proposed use.</SPAN></P>

Bain as guardian ad litem for the remaindermen under a trust created under the will of Caroline M. Menzel, deceased, one from an order of the Hennepin County District Court, Levi M. Hall, Judge, authorizing the Northwestern National Bank of Minneapolis as trustee to join in the execution of an agreement amending a long-term lease of certain land partially owned by the trust; and one from a judgment of said court affirming an order of the probate court of said county authorizing said bank as guardian of Emma Menzel Levering, incompetent, part owner of said land and a beneficiary of the trust, to join in the execution of the same agreement.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, appellant guardian ad litem sought review of the judgment of a Minnesota district court which authorized respondent trustee under the will of the decedent to execute and deliver an agreement amending a long-term ground lease. He also appealed from the judgment of the district court affirming a probate court order authorizing the guardian of an incompetent to join in the execution and delivery of that same lease.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the trust set up in the last will and testament of the decedent, the trustee held an undivided 4/10 of the land to which the lease pertained and the lessor's interest in the lease. In addition, the trustee, as guardian of an incompetent, held an undivided 3/10 of the land and the lessor's interest in the lease. The court held that the petitions of the trustee constituted application for authority to execute and deliver the proposed amended lease, a request for instructions in the administration of the trust, and for construction of the trust instrument in the light of the uses and trusts statutes. After examining the express and implied powers conferred by the will, the court concluded that the approval of the proposed lease was not in contravention of the trust. There was nothing in the instrument which could indicate that the settlor had a sentimental reason for wanting the property to vest in the contingent remaindermen at the termination of the trust free from the incumbrance of a lease continuing into the future. There was no support for the contention that the proposed extension would deprive the contingent remaindermen of property without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

The board members filed a motion to quash the writ on the ground that &sect; 154.22 was unconstitutional as it placed an unreasonable restriction upon the governor's power of appointment under Minn.

The court held that the right of the legislature to prescribe qualifications as the basis for appointment to public office was not inconsistent with the executive power of appointment to office.

The company appealed the decision pursuant to Minn. Stat. Ann. &sect; 216.25. Under the standard of review established in &sect; 216.25, the court held that the evidence sustained the findings of the Commission and the district court and the Commission did not go beyond its authority in ordering reestablishment of the passenger service. The court did acknowledge that the record of the Commission hearing revealed that one of the commissioners had behaved very hostile to the company. However, the court noted that it did not have the power to grant a new hearing, nor was their any way in which the court could disqualify a commissioner for bias. The court noted that the company had received due process and was allowed to submit its evidence. The court therefore held that the Commission's order was lawful.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the state officials contended that the variance was not material or that the erroneous provision should be severed from the law. The court affirmed the judgment. The court concluded that the erroneous provision was material because it was amended by the senate. The court determined that subsequent valid legislation defining the duties of the auditor could not be used to clarify the erroneous provision if the law was not validly enacted in the first place.

Under the liberal policy to be afforded in the operational activities of nonprofit corporations, it was not necessary that the entity meet every recognized requirement of qualification of a member or shareholder.

The Commissioner claimed that there was a deficiency in the taxes, disallowed the taxpayer's accounting methods, and assessed a deficiency for the tax year based on the three-factor formula in &sect; 290.19, subd. 1(2)(b). On de novo review, the state board affirmed the Commissioner's decision. In affirming the judgment, the court held that the record as a whole justified its belief that the formula adopted by the Commissioner and approved by the state board did give weight to the different factors responsible for the taxpayer's earning of the income; therefore, the multiple formula applied did properly and fairly reflect the taxpayer's income from its entire business among the various states in which it was conducted. Thus, the court concluded that the state board's affirmance of the Commissioner's decision to use the three-factor formula was supported by the evidence, and therefore had to be affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 97.49, subd. 1, to pay the civil servant's assistant director salary. Therefore, he was laid off. The court reversed the judgment that found the rider violated prohibitions against bills of attainder and ex post facto laws. The rider violated neither because it did not prohibit the servant from occupying other civil services positions, it did not specifically identify him, and there was no indication that the legislature passed the rider to punish the civil servant. The rider did not impair an obligation of contract because the legislature by creating the assistant director position possessed the power to abolish it and to fail to fund the position. Furthermore, in Minnesota a civil servant did not have a vested right in a particular position. For the same reason the legislature by enacting the rider did not unconstitutionally remove a state officer in the executive branch without finding malfeasance or nonfeasance. Finally, the court reversed the trial court's conclusion that the rider deprived the civil servant of equal protection because there were no facts in the record to sustain that conclusion.</SPAN></P>

In order to obtain a certificate as a master tradesman, and qualify for such work, defendant's firm was required to maintain a place of business in St. Paul. The court held that the ordinance was invalid because installation of metal flashings was incidental to roofing work, and the requirement that a roofer also obtain a license in warm air heating, ventilation, and sheet metal work was unreasonable and oppressive. In reversing the conviction the court held that the classification of non-resident contractors, in requiring them to obtain a place of business in St. Paul, was a violation of the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend.

However, the court directed on appeal that judgments should be entered in favor of the bar owner. The court explained that because the wrongful death act and civil damage act provided statutory rights unknown at common law, they were to be strictly construed. The court noted that the civil damage act provided a right of recovery only against alcohol providers who illegally sold intoxicating liquors. The court determined that under the Minnesota liquor laws, 3.2 beer did not come with the definition of an &quot;intoxicating liquor.&quot; Thus, the court held that even though the bar owner violated Minn. Stat. &sect; 340.03 by selling 3.2 beer to the minor, the action did not constitute an illegal sale of intoxicating liquor under the civil damage act. Also, the husband could not assert claims under civil damage act for his deceased wife because the statute required the action to be brought by the injured party.</SPAN></P>

There was no indication that the legislature intended ch. 117 to be limited in it its application to the condemnation of real estate only.

The difficulty in construing the statute had no bearing on the question of its validity because, whatever construction of the statute was adopted, a definite standard was established.

After the inmate actively participated in a riot, the warden placed him in segregated confinement. However, the Commissioner never enacted a mechanism for using segregated confinement as a means for discipline. The inmate filed a petition for habeas corpus seeking immediate release, contending that the use of segregated confinement was an ex post facto measure in violation of Minn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11 and U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 because it inflicted a more burdensome and aggravated punishment than was in existence at the time of his original sentencing or at the time of his participation in the riot. On review of the petition, which the warden and the Commissioner moved to dismiss, the court noted that, once the inmate had been committed or detained by virtue of a final judgment from a competent tribunal, under Minn. Stat. Ann. &sect; 589.01, habeas corpus proceedings were not available to the inmate as a means of seeking release. Habeas corpus proceedings were to be used against unlawful imprisonment. The court found that the inmate was lawfully imprisoned and affirmed the denial of the petition.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the landowner's motion requesting reimbursement for costs, expenses, and fees of counsel incurred in defending the taking of the right of access. The landowners appealed this decision. Affirming the portion of the motion which granted the State their costs, fees, and expenses, the court held that under Minn. Stat.

The prisoner contended that the trial court deviated from Minn.

The court did not consider whether there was any merit to the contention because, even if it was assumed that the prisoner had a constitutional right to be informed of his right to a jury trial prior to arraignment, the failure of the trial court so to inform him would not have been a violation of the due process clause where the prisoner was represented by competent counsel.

The trial court found the ordinance to be invalid and denied defendants' motion for a new trial or for amended findings. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court found that the city had no power or authority to contract for maximum rate schedules because of the enactment of 1919 Minn. Laws ch. 469. The city could not urge that the utilities company was estopped to challenge the validity of the ordinance because the city's authority, power, and duty in regard to rate regulation was delegated by the state and limited by the terms of such delegation. The title of 1919 Minn. Laws ch. 469 contained only one subject, which was the delegation of rate-fixing powers, and other provisions contained in the act were ancillary or incidental to that one subject.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the operation of a charitable hospital was a business in which the public had a direct and vital interest. The arbitration provided for in &sect;&sect; 179.35 to 179.39 was not the result of such an arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable action on the part of the legislature, or was so inadequate, unreasonable, and lacking in substance as an alternative to the right to strike that the entire act was invalid as violative of due process. The legislature in enacting &sect;&sect; 179.35 to 179.39 did not arbitrarily and unreasonably discriminate against certain individuals in favor of others. Minn.

The refusal to renew the owners' licenses was not unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment or Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, despite the legislature's motives, because the owners had no property rights to operate the stores. Without those property rights, the owners had no right to be paid because that would have been the expenditure of public funds for private purposes in violation of Minn. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county board proposed to redistrict Dakota county pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 375.02, which required a redistricting whenever one county commissioner district was found to contain 30 percent or more of the population of the county. The cities sought to enjoin the county board adopting a resolution affecting the redistricting, claiming that one of the districts, as redistricted, was not composed of contiguous territory as required by &sect; 375.02. The trial court affirmed the action of the county board, finding that plaintiffs failed to rebut the presumption that the county commissioners acted within the limits of their statutory powers in redistricting the county. Without a showing that the gross disparity in the population of the county commissioner districts was avoidable, the county board exercised proper discretion in compliance with the provisions of &sect; 375.02. On appeal, the court determined that the stipulated facts sustained the trial court's findings. However, the court remanded that case to the trial court to vacate the judgment and to take additional evidence as a basis for an additional finding of whether the gross inequalities in population were unavoidable.</SPAN></P>

The advisory board consisted of three employer representatives, three employee representatives, and three public representatives, all of whom were women. A former commission employee was appointed as one of public representatives. The commission received majority and minority reports, and announced that public hearings would be held on the issue of wages for women and minors. The retail merchant obtained a temporary restraining order to enjoin any action by the commission except to hold public meetings, claiming that the commission exceeded its jurisdiction. The trial court denied his motion for a permanent injunction and vacated the restraining order. On appeal, the court held that the merchant was not entitled to an injunction absent a final agency order, or the exhaustion of his administrative remedies, or the proof of irreparable harm. There was no final order and the merchant had not proven irreparable harm insofar as there was no determination from the commission with regard to the increase, if any, in women's and minors' wages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner challenged an order of the Faribault County District Court (Minnesota), which denied the landowner's alternative motion for judgment or a new trial after the return of a verdict assessing benefits of $ 408 against his land in an action under Minn. Stat. Ann. &sect; 106.471 for the repair of a county ditch.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner was the joint owner of the subject property with his wife. In the repair proceeding the landowner was assessed for benefits to his land. An appeal was taken to the district court, as provided by Minn. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 106.471, subd. 7(d), and 106.631. The jury in the district court found the land benefited to the extent of $ 408, and the trial court denied the landowner's motion for judgment or a new trial. The landowner appealed, and the court reversed. The court held that the landowner's property was not benefited by the original drainage system, that it did not fall within the purview of the repair proceedings for assessment, and that the legislature intended that benefit of a possible future outlet for a lateral should be left to appropriate proceedings for which it had specifically provided. The court found that the water from the landowner's property flowed in the same direction prior to the construction of county ditch No. 1 and in no greater quantity nor any more freely after the construction than before.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order against the landowner and remanded the case to the district court with instructions to enter judgment for the landowner.</SPAN></P>

Was the reorganization election invalid? Was the purported assumption of part of the bonded indebtedness of one of the former districts without the authority of the statute and thus invalid? The court discharged the writ and held that the reorganization of school district was proper and according to valid law, and that the questions of assumption of bonded indebtedness were not before the court. The court held that, at least insofar as the acts of 1947 and 1949 provided for a survey, which would ordinarily include a recommendation, they were constitutional. The court held that the acts of 1947 and 1949 were invalid insofar as they related to the reorganization itself, as distinct from a survey.</SPAN></P>

Despite the grocer's argument to the contrary, the court held that the vitamin products involved in the case were drugs within the meaning prescribed by &sect; 151. The court reasoned that the mere fact that they were harmless household remedies did not except the sale of the products from the operation of &sect; 151 unless they were also sold exclusively for non-medicinal purposes.

After findings for defendant, Victor H. Johnson, Judge, plaintiff appealed from the judgment.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the City of Duluth, Minnesota, appealed a judgment of the District Court for St. Louis County (Minnesota), which, after trial without a jury upon stipulated facts, denied the City's request for an injunction to restrain defendant bus company from operating its buses on the City's streets until certain license fees claimed to be due under Duluth, Minn., Ordinance No. 636, &sect;&sect; 3, 9 had been paid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bus company argued that, in a series of acts, of which 1949 Minn. Laws 694, &sect; 3, subd. 9 was the current act, the City and other cities similarly situated were deprived of the power to exact a tax or license fee or bond from interurban bus lines. On appeal, the court rejected the City's argument that 1949 act dealt with the taxation of motor vehicles and that the license required by the ordinance was not germane to taxation; the act dealt generally with the regulation of motor vehicles and not with taxation alone. Thus, the title of the act did not violate Minn. Const. art. IV, &sect; 27. The City did not challenge the 1923 predecessor to the 1949 act, which had reenacted the 1923 act without any change in language. Further, the 1949 act dealt with the same subject as the City's ordinance. The 1949 act was germane to the subject expressed in its title. Nor did the 1949 act constitute class legislation in violation of Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, art. IV, &sect; 33, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV; there was a demonstrable reason for the classification in the act. There was no merit to the City's argument that its right to exact the license fee was reserved to it under 1925 Minn. Laws 185, &sect; 18.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that &sect; 100.29, subd. 10 was not void for vagueness. The court wrote, inter alia, that &sect; 100.29, subd. 10 was clearly focused at stopping the shining of big-game animals, which in Minnesota practically meant deer. The court also ruled that the term firearm as used in &sect; 100.29, subd. 10 and a phrase &quot;or other implement whereby big game could be killed&quot; were not illegally vague. The phrase according to the court obviously referred to lethal instruments such as bows and arrows that could kill big-game animals.

The subpoena ordered the partner to produce all books, records, and documents of the brokerage firm relating to the names of persons, firms, and corporations who bought or sold transit company stock. The partner refused to obey the subpoena. The trial court issued an order to show cause, and the stockholder served on the Commission a complaint in intervention requesting that the petition be dismissed and the subpoena quashed. The court held that: (1) the provision permitting the commission to conduct investigations on its own motion in Minn. Stat. &sect; 216.21, was intended to give the Commission an informal means of aiding the performance of functions not quasi-judicial in nature; and (2) so long as an investigation was for a lawfully authorized purpose and the information sought relevant and material to the investigation, due process was not offended by requiring any person possessed of that information to testify.</SPAN></P>

The court found no constitutional violations and affirmed. The court held that: (1) public housing and slum clearance were public uses for which the power of eminent domain might be exercised; (2) the ability to pay and extent of protection or benefit were proper considerations to justify a classification because it was reasonably related to a governmental interest; and (3) the act contemplating the building of low income housing and the redevelopment of slum areas did not embrace more than one subject because the two matters were logically related.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured argued that he was not required to pay the surcharge as a condition to maintaining his policy in force. The court held that the trial court was correct in concluding that a justiciable controversy did exist, and therefore the action was proper for adjudication. However, the court held that the constitutionality of the tax could be sustained either as a tax on the privilege of the insurance company of writing insurance or as a tax upon the privilege of the property owner insuring his property against the risk of fire. The court concluded that Minn. Stat. &sect; 69.54 was not unconstitutional merely because it imposed a tax upon fire insurance premiums in certain cities of the first class and did not apply to all parts of the state. Therefore, the court reversed the decision of the trial court because &sect; 69.54 was not violative of the uniformity requirements of Minn. Const. art. 9, &sect; 1, or of the due process and equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, and it did not unconstitutionally delegate to the trustees of firemen's relief associations in cities of the first class legislative power in contravention of the constitution.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court held that, by including the acreage that was already incorporated in the city, the incorporators had exceeded their delegated legislative authority pursuant to 1885 Minn. Laws ch. 145. Because the area was not included in the proposed village territory by an unreasonable attempt to incorporate unsuitable but otherwise eligible land, the inclusion of the area was void ab initio. The court held that the whole proceeding was not vitiated but that a writ of ouster was to issue as to the area illegally included. The remaining portion of the territory in the village was, as a whole, suburban in character with houses and places of business somewhat scattered. It was not unreasonable for the voters to determine that this area and the undeveloped areas which adjoined the platted areas in the village were suitable for incorporation.</SPAN></P>

When the county proposed a new drainage ditch that crossed the company's main pipeline in three points and made it necessary for the company to alter or reconstruct the pipeline, the company sought compensation. The board approved a viewer's report awarding no damages to the company, and the company appealed. The district court dismissed the company's appeal finding that it was the company's uncompensated duty to reconstruct its pipeline to accommodate itself to the ditch. The court reversed the district court's order. In view of caselaw precedent, there was no question that the county in establishing the ditch was exercising its delegated power of eminent domain. Although the company did not own the fee title to the real estate involved, it did own an easement in the land, and an easement was property that when taken for public use entitled the owner to compensation. Clearly, there was a taking or damaging of the company's property for a public use. Thus, compensation was required.</SPAN></P>

There were three highway grade crossings over the tracks, one of which the railroad sought to eliminate. At the district court hearing, the village representatives unanimously testified against elimination of the track, pointing out that the track divided the village in half and would have a substantial effect on traffic and business. The railroad argued that the crossing was a hazard. The district court reversed the commission's order allowing the elimination of the crossing. The court held that the district court's finding, that the evidence did not support the commission's decision, was not arbitrary or capricious. The court agreed that the bulk of the evidence argued against the elimination and the claim of a safety hazard could be applied to any railroad crossing in a city center.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The street railway argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it impaired the obligation of a contract alleged to have arisen out of the original grant by the city and in that it worked a deprivation of property without due process of law. The court first held that the amendment to the ordinance constituted a valid amendment of the contractual relation between the city and the street railway. The necessary question was what powers, if any, the city possessed and which could have been exercised without impairing the obligations of the contract embodied in two prior ordinances. The court concluded that the city was possessed of police powers sufficiently broad to authorize the regulation of all forms of vehicular traffic upon its streets. The court also found no merit in the implied assumption that the exercise by the city of a licensing power for police regulation was necessarily inconsistent with the preservation of the street railway's franchise privileges. The legislative intent was to provide the city with the right to make the regulation. Therefore, the ordinance constituted a valid exercise of the city's police power.</SPAN></P>

Second, the court held that the seller was not required to sit in prison waiting on the slow appeal process. Next, the court held that the seller's incarceration was unlawful because Minn.

The court noted that the seller's action did not constitute disobedience of the lower court's order because a lawful order or decree presupposed authority on the part of the court to make it.

Union representatives threatened to strike, and the employer sought injunctive relief to avoid a complete shutdown. Upon trial a permanent injunction was granted. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held that the employer was entitled to injunctive relief because the union threatened to violate and would have violated Minn. Stat. &sect; 179.42, which declared that it was an unfair labor practice for a union to strike for the purpose of coercing an employer to persuade employees to join or refrain from joining any labor union. The court further determined that &sect; 179.42 did not violate Minn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2, 3 and U.S. Const. amends. XIII, XIV. The court reasoned that there was no constitutional reason why the State was not entitled to provide laws for enjoining a strike that had for its purpose a plan to compel or coerce an employer to violate the law. Furthermore, the court reasoned that Minn.

Laws ch. 596, &sect; 1, subd. 4 to secure the benefit of a tax computation based on a 50 percent long-term capital assets income gain rather than one of 100 percent. The court held that: (1) the Legislature could prescribe a condition or limitation governing the time when a right to a more advantageous basis of tax computation became available; and (2) respondent could not assail the constitutionality of one provision of an act and rely the validity of another portion of the act in the same proceeding.</SPAN></P>

The revision was published once in its entirety in a legal newspaper of general circulation, but not once each week for four successive weeks as required for amendments by art. IV, &sect; 36. Further irregularities appeared in the manner in which the revision was submitted to the voters at a special election. The taxpayer had sought to void a bond election by having the revised charter declared void. The taxpayer sought to distinguish between defects caused by failure to fulfill requirements of incorporation contained in art. IV, &sect; 36, and mere failure to comply with the statutory prerequisite as the &quot;color of law&quot; under which the revision took place. The court held that the City was at least a valid de facto government and the City had made a bona fide attempt to revise its charter.

The court further held that there was no basis for a finding that the landowner ought reasonably to have known or suspected a concealed danger.The court also held that because the employment clearly was the sole factor in exposing the employee to the blast of the shotgun shell when she accidentally tripped the firing mechanism in reaching for a towel, this was a compensable workmen's compensation injury.

In affirming, the court ruled that registration of a motor vehicle to the driver was prima facie, but not conclusive, evidence that he was the owner thereof. The court found that, although the purchase money came from one of the partners, it was presumed to have been donated to the driver, who was the partner's minor son. The court also found from the circumstances of the vehicle's purchase and registration that the intent of all involved was for the driver to own the vehicle. The court declined to decide the constitutionality of the statute involved but noted that the statute had repealed Minn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The liquor manufacturers and wholesalers asserted that the statutory amendment, Minn. Stat. &sect; 340.11, subd. 12(c), was unconstitutional because it violated the due process clause of Minn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 7 and of Minn. Const. art. 4, &sect; 33, insofar as that section prohibited class or special legislation. The statute separated wholesale dealers in wine from wholesale dealers in hard liquor and did not permit any wholesale dealer in either of these types of liquor from dealing in the other. On appeal, the court reversed the order below. The court noted that the mere fact that the legislature had created a classification in the liquor industry did not in itself make the law constitutionally offensive. However, the court ruled that a statute which attempted to regulate and control the liquor industry by merely separating the wine and liquor businesses at the manufacturing or wholesale level, and which did nothing about separating the same businesses at the retail level, was both arbitrary and unreasonable. The court held that the amendment violated the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 176.13(b) by providing that all employees who were totally and permanently disabled for a period of 20 years prior to passage but whose weekly compensation payments terminated in a certain six-month period were entitled to payments from a special compensation fund. The amendment was admittedly drawn to extend the benefits of &sect; 176.13 to the employee and it applied to no other person. The state treasurer challenged the Industrial Commission's order allowing the employee compensation from the fund. The court reversed the order. The treasurer had standing to challenge the amendment, as it was a matter of public interest. The amendment violated the prohibition against special legislation set forth in Minn. Const. art.

She challenged the city's ordinance on constitutional grounds. The trial court held that the ordinance was valid and denied her motion for a temporary injunction and dissolved her temporary restraining order. On appeal, the court affirmed the order of the trial court. The court held that prohibiting employment of women as bartenders was not unconstitutional as depriving them of liberty or property in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The ordinance was a police regulation on the retail &quot;on sale&quot; liquor business adopted to preserve the public peace. Legislation may exclude women from certain employments. The court believed there was a factual difference between the ability of men and women to function as bartenders. Permitting the employment of women as bartenders encouraged the presence of women in drinking places and that drinking by women would be encouraged and that result was against the public interest. There was difference in the relationships between a woman who was a licensee or whose husband was a licensee and other women.</SPAN></P>

The plaintiff demurred contending that the Act did not apply to it as a subcontractor. The trial court overruled the demure and certified the question for appeal.

The court found that so long as &sect; 36 remained in force, the city charter, as originally adopted and subsequently amended, was the charter of the city; the process of adoption did not start over, nor could the legislature have started it over. The court reasoned that the phrase &quot;and not otherwise&quot; in &sect; 36 emphasized the intent to foreclose and prohibit any other method of modifying the home rule charter; it must be by amendment only. The court further reasoned that the charter commission was endowed with no other power or authority to modify or change &quot;the charter,&quot; nor did &sect; 36 permit the legislature so to endow it; the provisions for formulating and submitting the original charter and, after its adoption, for formulating and submitting amendments constituted the total extent of power of proposal vested in the charter commission by the constitution.

The taxpayer filed an action under Minn. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed an order denying appellant's petition to vacate or reduce fines imposed for three drug sales offenses. Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.101(5)(b) permitted, but did not require, a court to reduce fines at its discretion. The gravity of drug-related offenses was not determinable solely by the value of drugs sold. Appellant's admitted profit motive and enjoyment in selling drugs for money, his recidivism despite prior judicial intervention, and the regularity of his drug dealing demonstrated that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by imposing the fines. Based on the same findings, as well as the fact that appellant was permitted to make installment payments, was young, employed, and had long-term earning potential, the court also held that the fines did not violate the Excessive Fines Clauses of Minn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a decision by the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) terminating her parental rights, arguing on appeal that the district court erred in admitting evidence of prior chemical dependency and that it did not have clear and convincing evidence to support its decision to terminate her parental rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a decision to terminate appellant's parental rights. The trial court did not err by admitting evidence of appellant's past conduct, involving repeated failures to successfully defeat an alcohol addiction, because, while the court had to consider the parent's present ability to care for the child, there was no authority that rendered the parent's past conduct irrelevant. Issues raised in prior administrative proceedings were not identical to the petition for termination of parental rights and were therefore not barred from consideration by collateral estoppel. Based on evidence that appellant's relapses into alcoholism endangered the child and that she failed to correct the conditions that led to the prior out-of-home placement, the decision to terminate parental rights was supported by substantial evidence and was not clearly erroneous, and the conclusion that termination of parental rights was in the child's best interests was supported by clear and convincing evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested and convicted of driving while under the influence. At the time of appellant's arrest, his driving privileges had been canceled and he had three prior driving while under the influence convictions. The court then granted respondent summary judgment in the action for the forfeiture of appellant's motorcycle. Appellant challenged the district court's order and argued the forfeiture was &quot;grossly disproportionate&quot; to the offense committed. On appeal, the court held that an in personam forfeiture was unconstitutional if the amount of the forfeiture was grossly disproportional to the gravity of appellant's offense. Here, the court held appellant fell within the category of individuals the forfeiture was intended to reach, namely repeat intoxicated drivers. Moreover, appellant's underlying criminal conduct was not &quot;harmless&quot; because he was arrested after the police witnessed him forcing other drivers onto the shoulder of a highway because of his erratic drunk driving.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his second-degree sale of methamphetamine conviction, contending that evidence seized from a vehicle should have been suppressed. The court held that appellant had standing to challenge the search and seizure because he had a possessory interest in the vehicle, although it was registered to another person, and affirmed the conviction. The vehicle was impounded because it was on a public street and improperly registered. There was no evidence that police procedures were not followed in conducting the inventory search, and the fact that the search was conducted at the scene by an officer involved in the criminal investigation did not invalidate the search. Appellant's contention that admission of a prior drug conviction was error also was rejected because the conviction was clear and convincing proof of appellant's participation in a prior similar crime, was relevant and material to the State's case, and was more probative than prejudicial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction was affirmed; evidence was seized from a properly impounded vehicle and an inventory search was authorized.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A consolidated appeal was based on the miscalculation of property taxes by appellant counties and the subsequent overpayment of taxes. One county was denied summary judgment by the district court, and in the other action, appellee was awarded judgment on the merits. Both counties appealed, arguing that an exclusive remedy existed for recovery of overpayments, and that the statute of limitations had passed. The court held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 278.01 was not the exclusive remedy. However, although the lower court erred in providing relief for a violation of due process, equity could grant relief from a unilateral mistake of law by the auditor. Therefore, the district court in one case properly granted relief, and in the other, properly refused to dismiss equitable claims.

After respondent pleaded guilty to the driving under the influence charge, appellant state moved for summary judgment. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's denial of appellant's motion for summary judgment and the court's sua sponte grant of judgment for respondent. The trial court erred in concluding that the statute violated constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy and excessive fines.

On appeal, the court found that respondent did not have official immunity from the tort action because respondent's actions were malicious, and not discretionary or individual. Furthermore, the court found that respondent was not statutorily immune from the tort because such immunity did not extend to municipalities. Additionally, the court found that legislative immunity did not protect respondent from liability under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and the state court had jurisdiction to hear the federal claim.

Respondent's driver's license was subsequently revoked. The district court rescinded the revocation of respondent's license, however, after determining that the limited-discovery provisions of the implied consent statute,&nbsp;Minn.

Respondent did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statutory discovery provisions, because respondent did not show that he was harmed, or that he was in imminent danger of being harmed, by the limited-discovery provisions. Respondent failed to demonstrate that the statutory discovery limitations were the direct cause of any inability to obtain the requested information. Further, respondent did not attempt to establish that, absent the information, he could not proceed and did not attempt to conduct any other discovery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of second-degree assault, fleeing an officer, fourth-degree assault, criminal vehicular operation resulting in bodily harm, driving after cancellation, fifth-degree controlled substance crimes, and possession of a legend drug.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was lawfully parked, but on a dead-end one-lane road, in the dark with the headlights off and the engine running, in an area where teenagers frequently congregated for illegal drinking and smoking, when an officer, who was aware that offenses characteristic of these facts were frequently committed at that location, parked behind him. Appellant was seized when the officer instructed him to remain in his car. A search of the car turned up a plastic bag containing one gram of methamphetamine. Prior to trial appellant moved to suppress the evidence. The trial court denied the motion. On review, appellant contended his seizure, for merely being present in the area, was unconstitutional. The court disagreed, holding that appellant was not merely present or passing through a high-crime area, but that, on the facts below, there was a valid investigatory seizure, and the trial court properly denied appellant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoners were incarcerated at state correctional facilities. After they were sentenced, the state Department of Corrections implemented a statewide policy of deducting room and board costs from inmates' wages to offset the costs of incarceration.

XIII; (3) deducting money from prisoners' wages to offset incarceration costs was not so punitive either in purpose or effect as to constitute additional criminal punishments for the same offense; and (4) because deducting costs from prisoners' wages was civil in nature, appellants' argument that it violated the constitutional prohibition against bills of attainder was without merit.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was committed for an indeterminate period and appellant's symptoms improved. Following appellant's petition for transfer or discharge, the court-appointed examiner and appellant's case manager stated that appellant lacked insight into his chemical dependency and needed to make further progress to prevent a relapse. The court held found clear and convincing evidence to deny appellant's full discharge. Continued commitment was not unconstitutional because it bore a reasonable relation to the original reasons for his commitment. The court denied the transfer because appellant would not be subject to state monitoring making the transfer tantamount to a discharge. The Interstate Compact on Mental Health, Minn. Stat. &sect; 245.51 (1998), did not apply because appellant was institutionalized for the commission of an offense for which, in the absence of mental illness, he would be incarcerated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a libel and wrongful discharge case, the court affirmed summary judgment against the plaintiff on his libel claims, because he failed to prove malice on the part of the public official defendants. Because the underlying individual defamation claims failed, defendant employers had no respondeat superior liability. Summary judgment for defendants on plaintiff's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 due process claims was affirmed because plaintiff failed to prove that individual defendants deprived him of due process or that municipal policy contributed to a constitutional deprivation. Investigation of plaintiff's personal life did not violate plaintiff's right to privacy, since it involved on-duty behavior. Defendants investigating plaintiff's misconduct were protected by qualified immunity because they were performing a discretionary function. Collateral estoppel precluded plaintiff's previously arbitrated wrongful discharge claim. Directed verdict for defendants on plaintiff's Minn. Stat. &sect; 626.89 claims was proper because no evidence suggested that a contrary verdict could be reached.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment for defendants affirmed because of qualified immunity and plaintiff's failure to prove public official defendants' actual malice or that defendants' actions or municipal policy constituted a constitutional deprivation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver had his driver's license revoked by appellee commissioner. The revocation arose out of his arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol. Appellant petitioned for judicial review of the revocation order. Also, he obtained police reports and the identity of witnesses, but requested no additional discovery. Appellant alleged the implied consent law's discovery limitations were an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers doctrine. The trial court held appellant had no standing to raise the discovery issue because he had received all requested discovery. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that state statutes were presumed to be constitutional and that appellant bore the burden of establishing the constitutional infirmity beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held appellant did not meet the burden because he sought no discovery beyond that permitted by the implied consent statute, and thus, suffered no harm from the statute's limitations.</SPAN></P>

The officer observed that the defendant was in a house, immediately prior to the execution of a search warrant for drug trafficking, for five to ten minutes, the average time required for such activity, based on the officer's experience.

The court found that the erroneous instruction failed to charge that the proof of guilt must be beyond a reasonable doubt and instead charged that it could merely be a reasonable construction of the evidence.

After the district court denied his motion to suppress, appellant entered a Lothenbach plea, explicitly reserving his right to appeal the district court's ruling.

The appellate court held that a warrantless pat down search could be justified if the officer had a valid reason to believe the motorist was engaged in the commission of a more serious crime. On reviewing the facts, the court concluded that the totality of the factors led the police officer reasonably to believe that appellant was engaged in criminal activity and that he may have been armed and dangerous.

Appellant claimed that his rights under the U.S. Const. amend I were violated because he was prevented from passing out political literature during a Halloween parade.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with failure to obey a lawful police order and two other misdemeanor offenses after he ignored a police officer's order to move onto the sidewalk and out of the street, where he had been campaigning as a candidate for public office during the 1996 Halloween Parade. Appellant filed a motion to dismiss the charges on grounds of a lack of probable cause and a challenge to the police order, and to the parade committee rule on which it was based, as a violation of the U.S. Const. amend I. The district court denied the motion to dismiss. Appellant waived a jury trial and submitted the case to the court based on stipulated facts. The court found appellant guilty as charged and concluded that the exclusion of political candidates was a reasonable, content-neutral &quot;time, place, and manner&quot; restriction on speech. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and held that while a public street is a traditional public forum where free speech is protected, if it is closed and dedicated to a parade, such activity can be prevented by police action and no violation of the U.S. Const. amend. I obtains from such action.</SPAN></P>

Upon granting the state's summary judgment motion, the court ordered that the escrow account be attached and that the funds be transferred into another account in the name of the state. Appellant challenged the trial court's order placing the escrow account in the name of the state. The court found that the attachment laws of Minnesota did not prevent the court from placing the escrow account in the name of the state. In affirming the trial court's order, the court noted that the language of attachment statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 570.051(1), was discretionary, and that it did not find that the court abused its discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that attachments were constitutional as long as they followed narrow guidelines and the defendant had an opportunity for a hearing. Appellant retailer was offered a hearing at respondent state's request. The funds in escrow were not released and were subject to the original escrow agreement; thus, the trial court's order transferring the funds to an account in the state's name was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant had filed a motion to dismiss an administrative child support proceeding, arguing that the administrative support process was unconstitutional. An ALJ (administrative law judge) had increased appellant's child support obligation then reduced the increase pursuant to a post-hearing motion, and rejected appellant's constitutional claims. Appellant challenged the ALJ ruling. The court reviewed the ALJ findings applying a clearly erroneous standard of review. The court applied existing statutes on child support modification. Child support was not to be modified if the moving party showed a substantial change in circumstances making the existing award unreasonable and unfair. An existing support award was presumptively unreasonable and unfair if applying the guidelines to the parties' current circumstances would produce a support award at least 20% and $ 50 different than the existing award. The court found the ALJ had not abused his discretion in finding appellant had not rebutted the presumption to show the support modification was unfair. Appellant's constitutional claims were dismissed.</SPAN></P>

After a test indicated he had an alcohol concentration of .16, his driving privileges were revoked.

Appellant challenged the denial of his petition to rescind the revocation of his driver's license following an implied consent hearing. Appellant contended the 1997 amendments to the Minnesota implied consent statute were unconstitutional. The trial court reviewed the license revocation order and sustained the commissioner's order of revocation. The court, on appeal, reviewed appellant's contentions of unconstitutionality of the implied consent statute de novo. The court ruled that in order to challenge the constitutionality of a statute, a party must have had a direct and personal harm resulting from the alleged denial of constitutional rights. The court determined appellant lacked standing to assert any of his claims as he had no previous DWI convictions and had not suffered any harm because he had been afforded a hearing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of a judgment from Kandiyohi County District Court (Minnesota), which dismissed two charges of an amended complaint charging violations of stalking and harassment under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.749 (1996), because they constituted serialized prosecution under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.305 (1998).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted an appeal by appellant from an order that dismissed two charges in an amended complaint. The court held that the lower court erred in concluding that Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.035(1)(1998), barred appellant from retrying respondent on those charges. Respondent was originally charged and convicted of five counts under the Minnesota harassment/stalking law, Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.749 (1996). Certain provisions of that law were declared unconstitutional. As a result, on appeal, the court granted respondent's motion to dismiss two counts. While this appeal was pending, appellant filed an amended complaint, based on the same conduct that charged respondent with two counts of harassment under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.749, subd. 2(2), which had not been declared unconstitutional. The court held that this amended complaint did not violate the statute prohibiting serialized prosecution, Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.035, subd. 1 (1998). The court held that these charges were subject to retrial, as they did not result in a conviction or acquittal. Therefore, the court concluded that the same conduct could be the source of a new charge. The court remanded for trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that dismissed the counts, and held that the charges did not violate the Minnesota statute prohibiting serialized prosecution, because the original charges had never resulted in a conviction or acquittal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order sustaining the revocation of his driver's license and argued that his right to counsel was violated. The record showed that after appellant was detained for driving while under the influence of alcohol and taken to a county hospital, appellant was given a telephone, two phone books, and 43 minutes to locate and consult with an attorney. The court held these actions vindicated appellant's limited right to consult with counsel under the circumstances. Appellant also argued his U.S. Const. amend. V rights were violated by the factual pleading of the implied consent statute. The court disagreed because the statute imposed a notice pleading requirement but did not compel incriminating statements. In addition, the self-incrimination right could be invoked in a civil proceeding only if the compelled statements were inherently self-incriminating. Finally, the court refused to consider appellant's premature argument that he should have been afforded the procedural protections due a criminal defendant since the civil revocation of his license could be used in the future as a criminal sentencing enhancement and affirmed the revocation of appellant's license.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order sustaining the revocation of appellant's driver's license for driving while under the influence of alcohol because appellant had been given an opportunity to consult with counsel before testing and had not been compelled to make incriminating statements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner had a driver's license subject to a &quot;B card&quot; restriction requiring him to abstain entirely from alcohol and controlled substances.

When police asked if he had any weapons, he gave them a knife. Police then conducted a pat down search and found petitioner's identification. A computer search revealed his B card restriction. The commissioner of public safety canceled and denied reinstatement of petitioner's driving privileges. Petitioner filed an application in district court for reinstatement of his driving privileges, pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 171.19, arguing the officer conducted an unconstitutional search that revealed his identity and the fact that he had a restricted driver's license. The district court denied the request.

Appellant sought review of that order. The court reversed and remanded regarding the increase in support, as appellant was unable to meet the increased level of support.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with two counts of enhanced gross misdemeanor driving while intoxicated and two counts of enhanced gross misdemeanor refusal to test.

The enhanced gross misdemeanor statutes were adjudged unconstitutional by the state supreme court, and appellant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that his detention was illegal because that decision nullified the statutes under which he was convicted.

The court upheld respondent's decision. The court determined that only respondent had the authority to declare who was eligible for treatment, and that its decision was unreviewable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants' son had a history of hyperactivity and was adjudicated delinquent after he constructed and exploded a bottle bomb. The court placed him on indefinite probation and ordered him to participate in counseling, render community service, and take all prescribed medications after consultation with a physician. Appellants questioned the appropriateness of the court's adjudication of delinquency without a detailed explanation, but the court held the adjudication was imposed within the limits set by the legislature and was not an abuse of discretion. Appellants also challenged the court's order that their son take medications if prescribed by a physician. The court stated the court below had the authority to order parents to provide special care and treatment for a child in need of such under Minn. Stat. &sect; 260.185(1)(g), but only within constitutional limits. The court held that absent consideration of the Jarvis factors, the order infringed unconstitutionally on the juvenile's right to privacy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner' right to counsel was vindicated. Petitioner was provided with a telephone, a directory, and access to the telephone to contact anyone he wanted. Moreover, the officer contacted the police department in petitioner' hometown, and allowed him to discuss his concerns regarding reciprocity with that state. The lower court correctly ruled that petitioner did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the discovery provisions of Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.123(5)(c)(d) (1998). By failing to demonstrate that the statutory discovery limitations were the direct cause of his purported inability to obtain the requested records, petitioner failed to demonstrate standing to challenge the provision. Petitioner contended that Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.123(5)(c)(b)(3) (1998) was unconstitutional under the U.S. Const. amend. V. Petitioner received a hearing and his petition disclosed no fact that might be incriminating. The statute's requirement, therefore, did not subject him to any personal harm and he lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute. Petitioner's due process arguments were not argued in the lower court and those arguments were therefore waived on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the trial court was affirmed because petitioner's right to counsel was vindicated, petitioner lacked standing for his constitutional statutory challenges, and petitioner waived his due process challenges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's summary judgment in favor of respondent municipality that dismissed appellant's action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.

On appeal, the court found that the appeal was timely; however, there was no violation of due process because appellant failed to allege any facts establishing an abuse of government power and there was no evidence of a policy, as a single incident did not constitute a policy, and mere negligence was not an actionable deprivation under the due process clause. The district court's refusal to consider the expert affidavit was not an abuse of discretion because the deadline for expert witness discovery had passed. The court rejected appellant's argument that the state's tort liability limit was unconstitutional because application of the rational basis test showed that the limits had a legitimate purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction entered against defendant for being a felon in possession of a pistol was affirmed because the officer had a reasonable belief that defendant might gain control of a weapon.

Stat. &sect; 609.343, subd. 1(a) (1998) after a jury trial. The appellate court reversed the trial court decision and remanded. The trial court erred by instructing the jury on two alternate theories of guilt for the single second-degree criminal sexual conduct charge as such an instruction violated appellant's substantial right to a fair trial by requiring an unanimous jury verdict pursuant to Minn. R. Crim. P. 26.01, subd. 1(5). The trial court expanded the original allegations by allowing the jury to consider events that allegedly occurred beyond the complaint scope as the disputed instruction allowed the jury to consider separate crimes to justify one charge. The jury instruction relied on two independent acts and it was impossible to determine for which act appellant was unanimously convicted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order revoking his probation. Defendant argued that the district court erred by admitting evidence obtained during an illegal search. Defendant pleaded guilty to third-degree possession of a controlled substance. He was sentenced to thirty-four months in prison, but execution of the sentence was stayed, and defendant was placed on probation for three years. A condition of his probation was that he not possess any nonprescription drug. A year later, defendant was arrested for careless driving. During a search incident to the arrest, police found crack cocaine in defendant's pocket. Defendant moved to suppress the cocaine and he contended that his arrest was illegal because careless driving was a misdemeanor offense. The court held that because the officer did not know of defendant's probation status, the marginal deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule was outweighed. Therefore, the evidence obtained during the illegal search was admissible at defendant's probation revocation hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ruled that even though cocaine had been suppressed in the criminal proceeding against defendant, it was admissible in the probation revocation proceeding to prove that defendant violated a condition of his probation. On appeal, the court affirmed this ruling because the evidence obtained during the illegal search was admissible at the revocation hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner sought review of the judgment of the Carlton County District Court (Minnesota) which dismissed his claim against respondent prison officials that had claimed the withholding of a percentage of his prison earnings to pay the court ordered fine, pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 243.23(3), was unconstitutional. Appellant also claimed the court had erred in ordering it to pay respondents' costs and fees under Minn. Stat. &sect; 563.02(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was sentenced to prison in 1991 and ordered to pay a fine. In 1997, respondent, the inmate accounts supervisor at the prison where appellant was being held, notified appellant that 50 percent of his prison earnings would be set aside for payment of the court ordered charges pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 243.23(3), which authorized such actions. Appellant sued, claiming that the law, as applied to him, was unconstitutional. Because &sect; 243.23(3) did not make a once innocent act committed by appellant illegal, increase his punishment, or deprive him of a once available defense, it was not an unconstitutional ex post facto law. Similarly, the statute was not retrospective because it did not impair any vested property rights of appellant, create a new obligation or duty, or attach a new disability for a past transaction. Therefore, the lower court's dismissal of those claims was affirmed on appeal. However, because only natural persons may recover under Minn. Stat. &sect; 563.02(4), and because respondents, who were represented by the attorney general's office, incurred no costs, the court below was found to have erred when it ordered appellant to pay respondent's fees and costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment dismissing appellant's constitutional claims was affirmed because the application of earnings withholding statute, which had been passed after appellant's sentence, was not an unconstitutional ex post facto law or an unconstitutional retrospective law. Judgment ordering appellant to pay respondents' costs and fees was reversed because respondents incurred no fees or costs and because they were not natural persons under the statute.</SPAN></P>

In support of its ruling, the court held that the factual-statement requirement did not violate respondent's right against self-incrimination, as he could not reasonably apprehend that his factual statement enhanced the threat of criminal prosecution. The court further held that a party had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute absent a direct and personal harm resulting from the alleged denial of constitutional rights. The court noted that the petition disclosed exculpatory, not incriminating facts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, committed indeterminately as psychopathic personalities, brought petitions for writs of habeas corpus to challenge the constitutionality of their commitments. The district court denied the petitions. The court affirmed. The court rejected appellants' argument that because Hendricks required evidence of an inability to control sexual impulses as a constitutional predicate to commitment as a sexual predator, appellants' commitments as sexual psychopathic personalities (SPP) violated substantive due process. The court pointed out that Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02(18b), part of the Minnesota's Sexual Psychopathic Personality Act (Act), did require utter lack of power to control sexual impulses for an SPP commitment. The Act did not deprive appellants of their right to procedural due process. As long as the application of statutory discharge criteria met the constitutional requirement that the nature of the commitment be reasonably related to the purpose for which the person was committed, due process was satisfied. An SPP commitment did not constitute double jeopardy because it was for purposes of treatment, not preventive detention.</SPAN></P>

Minnesota's Sexual Psychopathic Personality Act did not violate substantive or procedural due process because the Supreme Court had upheld challenges to similar laws. A commitment as a sexual psychopathic personality was for purposes of treatment, not preventive detention, and thus did not constitute double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his sentencing in the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) and contended that the court erred by denying his request for a continuance, and denying his notice of removal of the sentencing judge. In his pro se brief, appellant raised several challenges to his sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of an offense and his sentencing was delayed pending findings by the court psychologist. Appellant requested a continuance in sentencing claiming he did not receive the report in time to properly challenge it. The court denied appellant's request and sentenced him as a patterned sex offender. Appellant challenged his sentence based on insufficient time to prepare for the hearing, lack of notice of being sentenced as a patterned sex offender, violation of his rights of allocution, increase in the original sentence and violation of his U.S. Const. amend I and amend. V rights. The court, on review, found that the trial court had discretion in allowing the late filing of the psychologist's report, that appellant was not punished for not cooperating in the report, that appellant was not deprived of notice of the intent to impose patterned sex offender sentencing or implementing double durational departure sentencing as ordered by the court on prior appeal, that defendant had ample time to examine the psychologist or obtain his own evaluation, and that appellant's constitutional rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded appellant had ample time to prepare for the sentencing hearing, was not denied his First and Fifth Amendment rights, had notice that he would be sentenced as a patterned sex offender with double durational departure from the guidelines, was not denied allocution, and the court did not err in imposing sentence. Accordingly, appellant's sentence was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the trial court's pretrial order setting a cash only bail after appellant was charged with a gross misdemeanor for failing to properly register as a sex offender. Court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that appellant waived his right to challenge the constitutionality of the bail order because appellant failed to raise the issue with the trial court. At trial, appellant only argued that the bail was unreasonable. Appellant failed to file a motion for reduction or modification of bail raising the constitutional challenge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Court affirmed the trial court's judgment setting cash only bail because appellant failed to preserve the issue of the constitutionality of the trial court's judgment for review. Court concluded that appellant did not raise the issue at trial, and instead, only alleged at trial that the bail was unreasonable. Court held that the interests of justice did not require that it overlook appellant's waiver and reach the issue presented on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested for driving while intoxicated and failed a breath test. Her driver's license was revoked, and she petitioned for judicial review of the revocation under Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.123 (1998). At the hearing appellant argued that Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.123(5c)(b)(3), which provided that a petition for judicial review of a driver's license revocation state the facts underlying each claim asserted as a basis for rescission, violated a petitioner's constitutional right to be free from compelled self-incrimination. The lower court held that appellant did not have standing to challenge the new provisions in the implied consent statute and sustained the revocation of her driving privileges. The court affirmed, finding that to have standing, a party raising a constitutional challenge must establish a direct and personal harm resulting from the denial of constitutional rights. Appellant did not allege that the statements she made were or could be used against her in court, or that she was denied a hearing because of her failure to state facts supporting her claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When appellant was about 18, he sexually assaulted a number of boys and girls between ages 4 and 14. He pleaded guilty to several counts of criminal sexual conduct. His prison sentence was stayed and he was entered into an intensive sex offender treatment program. Over a period of several years appellant had numerous violations while in the treatment program and was returned to prison. The state filed a petition to commit appellant as a psychopathic personality. The trial court committed appellant. The court affirmed holding that clear and convincing evidence decisively supported the conclusion that appellant exhibited an utter lack of power to control his sexual impulses. Commitment as a sexual psychopathic personality required a showing that a person evidenced an utter lack of power to control his sexual impulses under Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02(18)(b).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commitment of appellant was affirmed because commitment as a sexual psychopathic personality required a showing that he had an utter lack of power to control his sexual impulses.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment of the Anoka County District Court (Minnesota) sustaining the revocation of appellant's driver's license. Appellant alleged the police violated his U.S. Const. amend. IV right against unreasonable searches and seizures when they entered the garage and home where appellant was staying.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated after he was involved in an accident. The police, acting on a report of an accident, spotted appellant's pick-up truck in his driveway. The truck was damaged and was parked in front of an open garage door. The garage was attached to a house via a service door. The officers entered the garage door and knocked on the service door. A house guest of appellant allegedly gave the officers consent to enter the home. Thereafter, the officers ascertained that appellant was intoxicated and arrested him. Appellant contended that the police violated his U.S. Const. amend. IV right against unreasonable searches and seizures. The court disagreed. The court found that the police entered the garage to knock on the service door, not to collect evidence, and even if the officers did violate appellant's rights, all evidence collected would have been obtained as a result of the inevitable discovery doctrine. The revocation of appellant's license was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the police did not violate appellant's rights. The police entered appellant's garage in order to knock on a service door, not to search for evidence. Once the officers knocked, they were given consent to enter the house by appellant's house guest.</SPAN></P>
