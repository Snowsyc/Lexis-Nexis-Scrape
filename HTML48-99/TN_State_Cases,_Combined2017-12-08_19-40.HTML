</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state trooper observed defendant driver traveling at an excessive rate of speed on an interstate highway. After defendant pulled over, the trooper had defendant perform field sobriety tests. Defendant failed, and the trooper placed him under arrest for driving under the influence in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-401. A blood sample was taken from defendant just over a half hour later. During voir dire of the jury, both plaintiff prosecution and defendant's attorney made misstatements regarding the inference applied to a positive blood-alcohol test. The trial court corrected the misstatements in front of the jury panel and again stated the permissible inference at the close of proof. The jury found defendant guilty; consequently, the trial entered judgment and sentenced defendant. Defendant appealed, raising multiple issues. The court affirmed the judgment because the evidence of guilt was sufficient beyond a reasonable doubt; the misstatements during voir dire were cured; the chain of custody for the blood sample was complete and reliable; and defendant's right to confrontation was not offended by the trooper's testimony as an expert.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for driving under the influence (DUI) from the Rutherford County Circuit Court (Tennessee), arguing that the statutory presumption of intoxication for multiple DUI offenses violated his right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant (DUI), his third offense. On appeal, he argued that the statutory presumption of intoxication for multiple DUI offenders, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-408(b), violated his right to equal protection. Appellant argued that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-408(b) violated his right to equal protection because the 0.08 presumption of intoxication applied only to defendants who had prior DUI convictions, while first-time offenders received the 0.10 presumption. The court found that the concept of equal protection under both the federal and state constitutions was that all persons similarly circumstanced should be treated alike. The court concluded that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-408(b) did not violate the right to a fair trial by lowering the presumptive level of intoxication for repeat DUI offenders because Tennessee had a legitimate interest in protecting its citizens from those offenders. The 0.08 presumption of intoxication was rationally related to deterring DUI crimes and was, therefore, valid under equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for driving under the influence of an intoxicant (DUI) was affirmed because appellant's right to equal protection of the law was not violated by the statutory presumption of intoxication for multiple DUI offenders as the state had a legitimate interest in protecting its citizens from repeat offenders.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the premeditated first-degree murder of his wife and the attempted first-degree murder of another person who was with his wife. The jury found that defendant had previously been convicted of one or more felonies for which the statutory elements involved the use of violence to the person. Therefore, the jury sentenced defendant to death. Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the death penalty. The court noted that a sentence of death was not disproportionate unless the case taken as a whole was plainly lacking in circumstances consistent with those in cases where the death penalty has been imposed. Defendant, armed with a bayonet, sought out his estranged wife. The only testimony regarding his state of mind when he learned that his wife was at the bar indicated that he was calm and collected. He stabbed his wife in cold blood, locked her in her car, and left her to bleed to death. He showed no remorse for his actions. He had two prior convictions involving the killing or attempted killing of other persons. Prior efforts to rehabilitate him were obviously unsuccessful. Therefore, the imposition of the death sentence was justified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the trial court (Tennessee) entered on a jury verdict, which sentenced defendant to life imprisonment after denying defendant's motion to impanel a jury to determine defendant's guilt or innocence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of first degree premeditated murder and was sentenced by the same jury to 40 years incarceration. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, but remanded the matter for resentencing. Defendant filed a motion with the trial court to impanel a jury to determine his guilt or innocence. The trial court denied defendant's motion and defendant was sentenced by a jury to life imprisonment. In affirming, the court noted that it had already determined in defendant's first appeal that the convicting jury's verdict was not void in its entirety but only as to sentencing. Thus, the court held that the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for a new trial on the issue of defendant's guilt was proper. According to the court, the doctrine of &quot;the law of the case&quot; applied and, thus, the court's earlier decision was binding on the court in the subsequent appeal. Further, the court held that the trial court properly redacted from the minute entry of the convicting jury's verdict the jury's assessment of defendant's punishment since it was plainly irrelevant in the context of defendant's resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, both juveniles, were convicted in a Robertson County trial court (Tennessee) of felony murder, attempted aggravated kidnapping, and civil rights intimidation. Both were given life sentences for murder. One defendant was given concurrent sentences for the other convictions to run consecutively to the life sentence. The other defendant received consecutive sentences for all three convictions. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>

Defendants' car stopped in front of the truck and the surviving victim testified that a man in the car pointed a gun. The surviving victim drove off the road and through a parking lot to get away from the scene. The appellate court held, among other things: (1) the fact that defendants were charged in juvenile court with premeditated first degree murder but were not convicted of that charge did not affect the validity of the proceedings for trying defendants as adults; (2) denial of an acceptance hearing in the trial court under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 37-1-159(d) was not unconstitutional; (3) exclusion of persons of unsound mind and habitual drunkards from juries did not violate the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 12101 et seq.; (4) the trial judge did not err in failing to recuse himself; (5) the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions; (6) consecutive sentencing and denial of probation were appropriate.</SPAN></P>

He admitted to police that he had been drinking that day; a blood test revealed a blood alcohol content of .16 percent. The appellate court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to suppress defendant's statements to police on the grounds that defendant was not advised of his Miranda rights, as defendant was not in custody when he made the statements. The results of the blood alcohol test also were properly admitted. Defendant lacked standing to claim that it was unconstitutional to instruct the jury that it could infer impaired ability to drive from a blood alcohol content of .08 percent or higher, when a .10 percent standard applied to defendants without a previous DUI conviction, as defendant's blood alcohol level exceeded either standard. The evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's convictions for aggravated vehicular homicide, vehicular assault, and leaving the scene.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Criminal Court of Shelby County, Tennessee, convicted defendants of first degree premeditated murder, especially aggravated robbery, and conspiracy to commit aggravated robbery. The trial court gave defendants consecutive sentences. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants maintained that the evidence was insufficient to convict them of first degree premeditated murder. Defendant former employee aided the robbery, with the intent that a robbery be committed. However, defendant former employee was not at the restaurant the night of the robbery and murder. Thus, the record did not contain any evidence that defendant former employee intended to assist in the commission of a murder, intended that a murder take place, or intended to benefit in the proceeds or results of a murder. The other four perpetrators entered the restaurant armed, acted with a common purpose, committed acts of violence against various employees, shot and wounded one employee, and shot and killed another. Under those circumstances, the other defendant could not escape criminal responsibility for premeditated murder.

After the officers smelled alcohol on his breath, defendant agreed to a blood test, which indicated that he had a blood-alcohol content of .12 percent. Defendant's indictment charged him with driving under the influence of an intoxicant or drug under &sect; 55-10-401(a)(1) (1998); or in the alternative, with driving with a blood-alcohol content of .10 percent or more under &sect; 55-10-401(a)(2). After his conviction under &sect; 55-10-401(a)(2), defendant argued that &sect; 55-10-401 and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-408(a) (1998) gave rise to different legal conclusions and that the trial court erred in charging the jury as to Tenn.

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 55-10-401 and 55-10-408 were not unconstitutionally contradictory. The court further held that defendant's claim that he was not impaired was not relevant under &sect; 55-10-401(a)(2) and that the jury was correctly charged as to both &sect; 55-10-401(a)(1) and &sect; 55-10-401(a)(2).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appealed a judgment of the Davidson County Criminal Court (Tennessee), which denied petitioner's application for post-conviction relief. Petitioner alleged that the trial and the appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance in several areas. Petitioner had been found guilty, by a jury, of felony murder and especially aggravated robbery, receiving a life sentence and a concurrent 20-year sentence, which was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As to trial and appellate counsel petitioner raised two issues as to each regarding their alleged ineffective assistance. On appeal, the court stated that the burden was on petitioner to establish that counsel's performance was deficient, and that, but for the deficiency, there was a reasonable probability that the result would have been different. Also, Tennessee attorneys should be held to a standard of whether the services rendered were within the range of competence demanded of criminal attorneys. The Post-Conviction Procedure Act required trial judges to enter findings of fact and conclusions of law on all issues presented under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-211(b). However, there were no findings for the court to review. There was some confusion as to whether petitioner talked to appellate counsel about what issues were to be presented for appeal. Also, appellate counsel admitted that he could have been deficient in failing to provide a transcript of the motion to suppress petitioner's identification. The case was remanded for the trial court to set forth written findings of fact and conclusions of law under &sect; 40-30-211(b) regarding the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case for the trial court to set forth written findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding petitioner's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, so that the court could properly review the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of killing a man during a robbery. The morning after defendant's arrest on another charge, he was advised of his Miranda rights. He told officers of finding a body of a black man in a field. He directed the officers to the scene. The victim's empty billfold was on the ground near his body. Defendant was advised again of his Miranda rights. Thereafter, he confessed to the murder. At the sentencing hearing, the jury found two applicable aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances. After the trial court denied defendant's first petition for post-conviction relief, the Tennessee Supreme Court issued an opinion holding the felony murder aggravating circumstance was unconstitutionally applied in cases where the death penalty was imposed for first degree felony murder. The appeals court agreed with the trial court that the jury's unconstitutional reliance on the felony murder aggravating factor amounted to harmless error. As the other remaining aggravating factor relied upon by the jury was defendant's six prior violent felony convictions, the sentence would have been the same had the jury not considered the invalid aggravating factor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that: (1) the trial court erred in its instruction to the jury on parole eligibility dates; (2) Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-201(b)(2)(A)(1) (1997) was unconstitutional; and (3) the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. Upon review, the appellate court held that the trial court committed reversible error in its instruction to the jury on release eligibility dates. Defendant was ineligible for parole before serving 25 years at the time of trial. Because defendant could not, under any circumstances, be eligible for release in 1.77 years, he was subjected, in effect, to a greater sentence than that about which the jury was informed. It was conceivable that, had the jury known that a first-degree murder conviction carried a minimum service of 25 years, it would have chosen to convict defendant of a lesser offense. The instructional error committed was misleading to the jury. The jury was informed that, even if it convicted defendant of the greatest offense with which he was charged, he could be paroled in less than two years. Misinformation of that magnitude resulted in prejudice to the judicial process.</SPAN></P>

In 1982 and again in 1989, the state legislature made changes to the sentencing laws. In 1997, petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, asserting that his constitutional rights to equal protection and due process required the application of the 1989 Criminal Sentencing Reform Act (1989 Act) to his sentence. The trial court dismissed the petition. The court held that the 1989 Act did not affect penalties imposed before the 1989 Act's effective date.  Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-11-112 had no bearing on petitioner's sentence because it applied only to cases in which the accused was to be prosecuted under the substantive law in effect at the time of the offense, and a new statute, calling for a lesser punishment, was enacted before punishment was imposed. The court held that the state had a legitimate interest in the finality of criminal convictions, and that the exclusion of those sentenced prior to 1982 from the 1989 Act's provisions had a reasonable relationship to a legitimate state interest. As such, petitioner's constitutional rights to equal protection and due process were not violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants rode motorcycles in a funeral procession. They did not wear helmets out of respect for the deceased, a former member of a motorcycle organization. They argued that the helmet statute violated their constitutional rights to privacy and of free expression. The appellate court disagreed. The right to privacy guaranteed by the Tennessee Constitution did not extend to conduct occurring within the public domain. Even assuming that refusing to wear a helmet as a symbol of respect was &quot;speech&quot; under the First Amendment, under the O'Brien test, &sect; 55-9-302(a) was within the state's police power to enact to protect the safety of its citizens. Further, the evidence was sufficient to convict. Although the officers could not identify most defendants at trial, they testified that they verified each person's identity while issuing the citation by a comparing each defendant with his or her driver's license. They also obtained each defendant's signature on the citation. The State introduced court documents which included defendants' signatures, and the jury was able to compare the signatures on these documents to the signatures on the citations.</SPAN></P>

He filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus, contending that the judgment entered against him was void because the second-degree murder statute, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-211 (1982), was unconstitutionally vague. The circuit court dismissed his petition, finding that the allegations were not cognizable in habeas corpus proceedings. Defendant appealed. The court held that defendant did present a cognizable claim for a habeas corpus proceeding because, if &sect; 39-2-211 were unconstitutional, as defendant contended, it would have been void from its date of enactment, and the circuit court would have lacked the subject matter jurisdiction to hear defendant's case, rendering his judgment of conviction void. The court found, however, that &sect; 39-2-211, read as a whole and in conjunction with the general murder statutes,&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-2-201-202, clearly established that second-degree murder was any murder by exclusion which was not first-degree murder. Therefore, &sect; 39-2-211 was not void for vagueness for its failure to allege the elements constituting the offense of second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The language of count one of the challenged presentment tracked the language of the statute and sufficiently informed the accused of the charge against him. By incorporating the words found in the language of the statute, i.e., unlawfully and feloniously, the presentment sufficiently apprised defendant of the requisite mens rea under the law at the time for count two, aggravated kidnapping. The body of the presentment itself was sufficient to apprise the defendant of the charge which he was to defend. It set forth unlawful sexual penetration of the victim in count one and, abduct, kidnap, or carry away another in count two, along with the other essential elements of the crimes. The reverse side of each count of the indictment could be considered in determining whether the indictment sufficiently apprised defendant that he was charged with aggravated rape and aggravated kidnapping. The reverse side was accepted by incorporation by reference. Since the requisite offenses were stated on the reverse side of the presentment, defendant was apprised of the charges he was to defend, and the presentment was valid.</SPAN></P>

Defendant focused the camera on the breasts and pubic area of the minor during certain portions of the tape, his girlfriend encouraged the minor to pose for a pretend camera, and both girls were nude. Defendant also viewed the videotape before engaging in sexual relations with his girlfriend. The video fell within the definition of sexual activity. Defendant produced a tape that met the statutory definition of promote and the evidence indicated that defendant used the video to satisfy his own sexual desires. The word &quot;lascivious&quot; in the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The great weight attributed to the enhancement factors more than justified the 10-year sentence imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On defendant's direct appeal from the Hamilton County (Tennessee) trial court, defendant filed with the court a copy of an appellate opinion in order for the court to review the constitutionality of the jury charge on parole eligibility that was used in the defendant's case, an issue not raised in the appeal. The court affirmed defendant's conviction of second-degree murder. Defendant submitted a petition to rehear.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant again relied upon the submitted appellate court opinion for the proposition that the parole eligibility charge given to the jury in defendant's case was unconstitutional. The court held that the denial was supported by any one of three bases. First, defendant failed to show that current law supported his position on the substantive issue. Second, as to defendant's plain error claim, defendant could argue at most that the law in the area was unsettled; no clear and unequivocal rule of law supported defendant's claim. Finally, a claim of plain error was belied by the probability that any error was harmless. Defendant was indicted for murder in the first degree. Despite the jury having heard the parole eligibility information, it acquitted defendant of first-degree murder and convicted him of the lesser offense of second-degree murder. That situation supported a finding that any error in charging the jury with parole eligibility information was harmless.</SPAN></P>

The jury was verbally discharged and had gone into the public area of the courthouse when the jury was reconvened. The jury then returned a guilty verdict for facilitation of second degree murder and facilitation of attempted second degree murder.

Petitioner challenged a decision from a trial court, Davidson County (Tennessee), which dismissed his petition for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition was dismissed on the grounds that it was filed outside the applicable statute of limitations. The court reversed the dismissal and held that, although there was a one-year statute of limitations applicable to all post-conviction petitions filed after May 10, 1995, where a person convicted of a crime took no action to perfect his right to appeal, the statute of limitations, applicable to post-conviction petitions, began to run from the date of final conviction. In the instant case, where a resentencing hearing was the final action from which there was no appeal, the statute of limitations did not begin to run until 30 days after petitioner was resentenced. As such, the petition was timely. Although Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-36-106(e)(4) (Supp. 1995) made it clear that the trial judge had the authority to resentence a defendant originally sentenced under the Community Corrections Act, the statute was explicit in that a judge could only sentence a defendant up to the maximum sentence within the appropriate range. Because there was a maximum of 12 years that could be imposed on any Range I offender convicted of a class B felony, any sentence over 12 years was illegal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant got into the victims car, acted as if he had a gun in his waistband, threatened her, and stole her wallet. He was convicted of aggravated robbery by the Davidson County Criminal Court. The trial court sentenced him to eight years as a Range I standard offender. Defendant appealed and claimed that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-402(a)(1) (1991) was unconstitutionally vague and that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 39.13-402(a)(1) defined aggravated robbery as robbery accomplished with a deadly weapon or by display of any article used or fashioned to lead the victim to reasonably believe it to be a deadly weapon. The defendant contended that the language was unconstitutionally vague, as a reasonable person could not read the statute and know what was prohibited, and because the statute did not provide explicit standards to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The defendant argued that he did not &quot;display&quot; anything and that &quot;article&quot; should not be interpreted to mean a human hand. The appellate court held that &sect; 39-13-402(a)(1) applied in a wide variety of situations and that greater precision in wording the statute would have been impractical and made the statute difficult to apply. The new statute was intended, in the opinion of the appellate court, to include robbery committed under the pretense of being armed. The evidence was sufficient to support the defendant's conviction for aggravated robbery. The victim testified that defendant held his hand in the waistband of his pants, as if he had a weapon, and said to her &quot;don't make me have to hurt you.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was convicted for aggravated rape and sentenced as a persistent offender for an especially aggravated offense to life imprisonment.

The trial court, Hawkins County (Tennessee), denied the motion. The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, although the defendant conceded that he was convicted and sentenced prior to the effective date of the 1989 Sentencing Act, he argued that the 1989 Sentencing Act provided for a lesser penalty for the offense of aggravated rape. Therefore, he claimed his life sentence was unconstitutional and had to be recalculated under the later statute. The appellate court rejected the defendant's contention and affirmed. The 1989 Sentencing Act applied only to offenders sentenced after its effective date. Therefore, the defendant, who was sentenced prior to the effective date of the 1989 Sentencing Act, had to be sentenced under the 1982 Sentencing Act. There was no constitutional violation, even though the subsequent act contained a lesser sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and received the death penalty based upon a single aggravating circumstance that defendant was engaged in the commission of a robbery at the time of the crime, pursuant to Tenn.

Defendant filed a post-conviction petition that alleged among other issues that defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, but ordered a new sentencing hearing. The court held that even though defendant's lead counsel abused alcohol and drugs during representation, failed to present psychological testimony at the suppression hearing, and failed to object to testimony that defendant had killed before, defendant failed to establish that but for his counsel's conduct the result of the trial would have been different. Defendant's counsel failed to discuss mitigation factors with the expert prior to the day of trial, and did not present evidence of applicable mitigation factors. The court held that defendant's counsel was ineffective in presentation of expert testimony on mitigation factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of aggravated rape and rape. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found defendant waived his right to object to his trial counsel being ineffective for failing to call him as a witness where defendant failed to submit a record adequate for review because he did not include the transcript of a motion for new trial. The court held there was sufficient evidence establishing bodily injury as required to support the aggravated sexual assault conviction where a cut and bruise on the victim were adequate elements justifying a conviction for aggravated rape. The court determined defendant was not entitled to a mistrial on the basis that the jury was improperly allowed to see a witness coordinator comfort the victim where there was nothing in the record to indicate the jury knew that the witness coordinator was an employee of the state. The court concluded that defendant's 23-year sentence for aggravated assault was not unconstitutionally disproportional where the sentence range for such an offense was between 15 to 25 years and the comparison of the crime to the sentence did not lead to an inference of gross disproportionality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Davidson County Criminal Court (Tennessee), which convicted him of aggravated robbery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose from an incident in which, after the victim gave him a ride, he took possession of the car at gunpoint. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court found that the victim's testimony identifying defendant as the perpetrator was sufficient, in and of itself, to support the conviction and that the victim's testimony alone was sufficient to establish the elements of aggravated robbery. The court refused to review the jury's determination of the factual issues presented. The court held that the trial court did not err when it instructed the jury on the range of punishment that the trial judge could impose and on the possibility of parole eligibility because those instructions were proper pursuant to a constitutional statute,&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-201. The statute was constitutional because it did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers, nor did it deprive defendant of his right to a fair trial pursuant to his right of due process. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The jury was provided accurate information regarding the sentencing range and how long defendant would serve before becoming eligible for parole.</SPAN></P>

Defendants were later arrested and identified by witnesses at two show-up identifications.

After a jury trial, defendants were convicted on the murder, robbery and theft counts and sentenced to a total of life plus 29 years' imprisonment. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. The court held that the identification testimony was admissible because the show-ups were not so suggestive as to create a likelihood of misidentification. The court ruled that defendants' Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not attached when the show-up identifications were conducted because no formal charges had been filed. The court held that the trial court committed harmless error by instructing the jury on defendants' parole eligibility. However, the court held that the trial court improperly applied Tenn.

The defendant was in a gang and received an order to kill the deputy from the leader who was in prison. The defendant believed that, if he did not kill the deputy, he or his family may be killed. The appellate court held that the defendant acted with specific intent to commit first degree murder, as the State proved that he had been in on the planning to kill the deputy the day before it occurred. The court also found that the jury was able to discount the defendant's claim of duress, as the evidence demonstrated a lack of a present, imminent, impending, and continuous threat of harm. Even if a satisfactory threat of harm was found, the jury was entitled to conclude that avoiding gang retaliation did not outweigh the harm of killing the deputy. The court erred in instructing the jury that the defendant would be eligible for parole in 25 years, if he received only a life sentence, as opposed to life without parole, as a conflict existed in the amended parole eligibility statutes. In reviewing the legislature's intent, the court held it was clear that one sentenced to life imprisonment would not be eligible for release for 51 years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the order of the Dekalb County Criminal Court (Tennessee), which dismissed his petition for post-conviction relief after a jury convicted him of one count of selling codeine, a Schedule III controlled substance. The court affirmed the conviction on direct appeal. Defendant then raised issues that included ineffective assistance of trial counsel and the lack of a lesser-included offense instruction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his girlfriend sold drugs to an undercover officer while a confidential informer was present. On this appeal, the court found that defendant waived several issues by not raising them on direct appeal, including a late notice by the State of its intent to nolle one drug charge, references to the drugs involved in that charge, the constitutionality of the career offender statute, and the failure of the trial court to instruct on a lesser-included offense. The court found that defendant failed to prove that trial counsel was anything but effective when the hearing evidence showed that he made serious attempts to find the informant and that the girlfriend, if called as a witness, would have perjured herself and been subject to impeachment. The court noted that tactical decisions, even if poor, did not constitute ineffective assistance, and the failure to request a lesser-included offense instruction did not raise a constitutional issue to take the instruction issue outside the scope of direct appeal. The court held that the hearing evidence did not preponderate against the trial court's finding that defendant received the effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order that denied post-conviction relief to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder. Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress statements made to the police because he was intoxicated at the time the statements were made. The court ruled that before a defendant could knowingly and voluntarily waive his Miranda rights he must be adequately and effectively apprised of his rights, and if the waiver was made voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently then a defendant could waive his rights. Further, the court held that the burden of proving the waiver by a preponderance of the evidence at the hearing on the motion to suppress was on the state. Also, the court found that in determining whether a defendant validly waived his Miranda rights, courts must look to the totality of the circumstances. The court affirmed the judgment convicting defendant, concluding that intoxication did not render a defendant's confession invalid if the evidence showed that he was capable of understanding and waiving his rights.</SPAN></P>

The court found that given the time of night, defendant's crossing of the fog line three times, and the distance from which the vehicle had come, the police officer had cause to stop defendant's vehicle, if for no other reason than the public's safety. The court also found that within less than five minutes after stopping defendant's van, the police officer determined that he was not intoxicated and that defendant could have gone on his way, if he had not consented to a search of his vehicle. The court noted that the trial court failed to make any findings concerning the voluntariness or validity of defendant's consent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to his federal drug conviction, defendant had pleaded guilty to malicious shooting and aggravated assault. He petitioned for relief from the prior convictions which he claimed enhanced the federal sentence. The trial court found the petitions barred by the statute of limitations and dismissed them. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the filing of both petitions was well past the statute of limitations applicable to post-conviction proceedings under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-202(a) (1997). Defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, involuntary guilty plea, lack of jurisdiction, and the prosecutor's failure to disclose exculpatory evidence did not fit into any of the statutory categories for untimely consideration. Defendant did not make a proper argument for a &quot;later arising&quot; claim because he failed to allege the date on which he discovered the purported misdeeds of the prosecution. This lack of information prevented the court from determining whether the grounds arose after the limitations period and from balancing defendant's liberty interest against the State's interest in preventing collateral attack on an eight-year old conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate was convicted of three counts of premeditated first degree murder and sentenced to death on each. The convictions and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal, and he subsequently filed a petition for post-conviction relief which was denied by the trial court. The inmate appealed from that denial, challenging the effectiveness of his trial and appellate counsel and raising other issues regarding the proceedings at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate maintained his innocence throughout his murder case, despite some rather damning evidence against him, and claimed that the inexperience and lack of organization of his defense team hampered the presentation of a solid reasonable-doubt defense. In affirming the denial of the inmate's petition for post-conviction relief, the court stated that the record did not support that contention. There was a strong presumption that counsel's conduct fell within the range of competence demanded, and the inmate simply had failed to overcome the presumption. Most of the claimed errors involved trial tactics or strategy. The inmate failed to adequately demonstrate that the prosecutor's brief and limited statements required reversal of his sentence or conviction in light of the overwhelming evidence against him. To the extent that the inmate challenged the jury instructions, prosecution argument, and the constitutionality of the death penalty statute outside the scope of the ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim, those issues had either been waived or previously determined. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-112.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found the defendant failed to carry his burden on appeal and, therefore, affirmed the judgment of the trial court denying his petition for post trial relief.</SPAN></P>

He appealed from his convictions, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion to sever, and that the evidence was insufficient to support findings of guilt for both counts of reckless endangerment. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to sever because the evidence was relevant to proving identity and motive, and the prejudicial effect did not outweigh the probative value. In addition, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the convictions. The court noted that defendant recklessly drove through a residential neighborhood at an excessive speed, giving rise to a reckless endangerment conviction, and that, by driving his car into the officer's path, defendant committed an aggravated assault. The charges of aggravated assault were not &quot;essentially incidental&quot; to the reckless endangerment conviction. The separate convictions did not offend due process rights.</SPAN></P>

Two years later, upon an undisclosed charge, petitioner was sentenced in federal court to a term of almost 25 years as a career offender; the two state convictions were used to enhance the term. Seven years later, petitioner filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that his guilty pleas to the drug charges were unconstitutional because the trial court failed to inform him of his right against compulsory self-incrimination and right to confront his accusers. The trial court dismissed the petition. On appeal, the court held that the petition was properly dismissed. Because petitioner's sentences for the state convictions had expired and he was in federal custody, the trial court lacked the authority to grant the writ. Further, the petition, which the court treated as one for post-conviction relief, was barred as untimely pursuant to the Post-Conviction Procedure Act, specifically Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-202(b), because petitioner failed to file within the required one-year period after the judgment became final and no exceptions were applicable.</SPAN></P>

Also, defendant admitted to a cellmate that he had planned to hurt his wife if she refused to reconcile with him. The court held that witness testimony of a statement made by defendant's brother referring to defendant's state of mind was properly excluded as hearsay because it did not fall within the state of mind exception of Tenn.

The court found that the results of a blood alcohol test of the defendant established an inference that he was intoxicated under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-408(a) (1993). It was the jury's role, noted the court, to decide whether that inference was sufficient to establish that the defendant had been intoxicated while driving.

Section 39-13-522(a) did not expressly require nor plainly dispense with the requirement for a culpable mental state. However, the required mental state could have been inferred from the nature of the criminal conduct alleged in the indictment. The language of the indictment sufficiently apprised petitioner of the offense charged, and the indictment was stated in ordinary and concise language so that a person of common understanding would have known what was intended, in accordance with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-13-202. The indictment met constitutional and statutory requirements of notice and form and was, therefore, valid. There was no evidence that the jury was not selected from a source fairly representative of the community. There was no evidence to suggest that any of the jurors were biased. The court found that petitioner's trial counsel used a legitimate trial strategy in relying upon the single medical evaluation of the victim. In addition, there was no evidence that witnesses not called at trial would have in any way helped petitioner's case.</SPAN></P>

The inmate also waived the allegation that the reasonable doubt instruction was unconstitutional because he did not object to the instruction or contest it in his motion for a new trial or on appeal.

The court ruled that defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel did not demonstrate a basis for reversible error because defendant did not show that the counsel's strategy at trial or during sentencing resulted in prejudice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of felony murder. The jury sentenced defendant to death upon finding two aggravating circumstances: the murder was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel and the murder was committed during the perpetration of a felony. In light of defendant's conviction for felony murder, the felony-murder aggravator could not have been used to support defendant's death sentence. However, the court concluded that the error was harmless and did not mandate a reversal. The jury foreman's inability to pronounce certain words in the verdict form did not mean that the jury did not understand the meaning of the heinous, atrocious or cruel aggravator. The court held that the evidence reasonably supported a finding that defendant had a direct role in the robbery and felony murder. Even without a finding that defendant personally committed the brutal killing, the evidence showed that defendant actively planned and carried out the robbery, he benefited from the proceeds of the robbery, and he was present in the store as an aider and abettor when the victim was attacked. The court found no mitigating evidence sufficient to reduce defendant's culpability for the crimes.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the jury instruction as to identification was not necessary, and any error created by failing to give such an instruction had no effect on the outcome. The court also found that the interjection of range of punishment coupled with the statutorily required minimum parole eligibility date, sentence reduction credits, and the governor's power to reduce prison overcrowding, at the guilt phase of a trial, was so unduly prejudicial to the determination of guilt that it rendered the trial fundamentally unfair.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated sexual battery. After his previous request for post-conviction relief was denied, petitioner filed another request for habeas corpus and post-conviction relief. Petitioner claimed that his sentence was unconstitutional and illegal because it was indeterminate, that he was not receiving the benefit of his plea bargain, and that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel in conjunction with his plea bargain. The trial court denied the request because the request was repetitive, beyond the three year statute of limitations for post-conviction relief petitions, and did not state a cause of action for habeas corpus relief. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the issues presented in the appeal were previously determined and could not be reviewed again pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-206(h) and that the petition was filed beyond the statute of limitations, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-202. The court also held that pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-21-105, the trial court was without jurisdiction to consider any habeas corpus claims because the petitioner was incarcerated in a different county.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state contended that: (1) there was no constitutional impediment to making a jury aware of possible punishment and sentencing contingencies; (2) a jury could properly be told to consider punishment in determining guilt or innocence; and (3) if the instruction was erroneous, it was not plain error. The court stated that the jury in the case at bar was not merely instructed as to possible sentencing consequences. The jury was instructed that they could weigh and consider the meaning of a sentence in arriving at their verdict on guilt or innocence. The state argued that the jury could be told to consider the punitive consequences of a guilty verdict in determining guilt or innocence. However, the court noted that a defendant had only a claimable statutory right to have the jury know the range of punishment before deciding guilt or innocence. Finally, the state contended that the jury instruction was not &quot;plain error&quot; since other panels of the court had upheld the constitutionality of the statute. The court concluded that how other panels of the court had or had not ruled was not determinative of the issue of plain error.</SPAN></P>

He appealed, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction, that he was denied effective assistance of counsel, that the solicitation statute was unconstitutional, and that a jury charge was improper. The court reversed and remanded because of prejudicial error. The court held that the defense counsel's failure to communicate a plea offer prior to trial qualified as ineffective assistance even though defendant had earlier instructed that he would not enter a plea agreement. The court determined that the state was required to reinstate its original guilty plea offer and negotiate in good faith. Should the parties fail to reach a plea agreement or should the trial court refuse to approve it, then there would be a new trial. The court also held that there was sufficient evidence to support solicitation to commit intentional, premeditated, and deliberate killing. The court held that the solicitation statute was not vague or overbroad.

He was fined, sentenced to jail time and probation, received a license revocation for 1 year, and was ordered to complete public service work.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 55-10-415 was unconstitutional because subjecting adults ages 18 to 21 to sanctions based upon .02% blood alcohol content while not subjecting adults ages 21 and older to the same sanctions violated his rights to equal protection. The court found the statute to be constitutional and affirmed the judgment of conviction but modified defendant's sentence. A driver's license was not a fundamental right, but &sect; 55-10-415 was subject to strict scrutiny equal protection analysis because the authorized punishment of public service work was a deprivation of personal liberty. The state had a compelling interest in maintaining the safety of the roads and protecting the public from younger drivers who had consumed alcoholic beverages in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 1-3-113(b).  Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-415 was constitutional because it was narrowly tailored to protect that interest.

The court affirmed, holding that the indictments were not fatally defective, but were adequate. The court held that there was evidence sufficient to support a finding by a rational trier of fact that defendant was guilty of rape beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant's equal protection rights were not violated when the state used its peremptory challenges against African-American venire members but not against two Caucasian venire members who also knew defendant because defendant failed to establish a prima facie case of exclusion based on race. In addition, the state had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory justification for excluding the African-American juror. The court also held that the offenses of rape and sexual battery did not constitute the same offense because the same evidence was not used to prove each crime, the offenses involved separate, discrete sex acts, and the legislature did not intend for convictions under the statutes for the two offenses to punish the same evil. Thus, defendant's convictions for both did not violate double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

There was no merit to the convict's claim that his attorneys in the underlying proceedings rendered ineffective assistance because he did not demonstrate how the advice to plead guilty was erroneous. The convict's claim that the habitual criminal provision under which he was sentenced was unconstitutional was barred by the statute of limitations.

The trial court dismissed defendant's petition, holding that the grounds alleged were appropriate for post-conviction relief, but not cognizable in a habeas corpus proceeding. The trial court was unable to treat defendant's petition as one for post-conviction relief because it was not filed in the court that convicted him as required by Tenn.

The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence seized during the second search.

The court affirmed and held that habeas corpus relief was available only when a judgment was void, not merely when the judgment was voidable.

The defendant also challenged the parole eligibility jury charge. Although he did not specifically base his contention upon constitutional grounds, in the trial court the defendant made a general objection to the parole eligibility jury charge on the basis of constitutional infirmity. However, no specific constitutional basis was expressed. Thus, that the constitutionality of the parole eligibility jury charge was not specifically presented as an issue for the court's review. However, the court found the parole eligibility jury charge, under the facts and circumstances of the case, contained such egregious and fundamental error that it affected the fairness and integrity of the judicial proceedings. The jury instruction unconstitutionally informed the jury that they could consider extraneous and irrelevant information in determining guilt or innocence. Therefore, the court found plain error and determined the only remedy was the granting of a new trial..</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the mother's conviction and affirmed the stepfather's conviction. The court held as follows: 1) the proof that the mother heard two loud thumps while the stepfather was giving the child a bath and the medical examiner's testimony that the injury was inflicted by a blunt force to the child's abdomen was more than sufficient to establish that the stepfather had knowingly inflicted a serious bodily injury on the child, thereby recklessly killing her; 2) to the extent that the State was attempting to prove that the stepfather was guilty of first-degree murder by aggravated child abuse through his neglect of the child, evidence of the non-fatal bruising was relevant to establish what the stepfather had known about her physical condition; and 3) aggravated assault required proof of an element not included in the greater offense, that the mother was the parent or custodian of the victim, and the greater offense could have been committed without committing the &quot;lesser&quot; offense, because the perpetrator of the murder could have been someone other than the child's parent or custodian.</SPAN></P>

He was convicted of felony murder and sentenced to death by electrocution after the jury found that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel in that it involved torture or depravity of mind. The court affirmed the conviction and the sentence, determining that the language of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-203(i)(5) (1982), which provided that a murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel if it involved torture, was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The trial court did not err by permitting the state to introduce evidence during the resentencing hearing of the victim's race as a motive for the commission of the crime because race was an integral dynamic of the circumstances surrounding the murder, and the jury was entitled to have this base of knowledge when sentencing defendant. The testimony was also relevant to rebut the statutory mitigating circumstances submitted by defendant, such as that he acted under duress and that he appreciated the wrongfulness of his conduct. The prosecutor's references to the Bible were inappropriate but did not constitute reversible error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that there were numerous errors in both the trial and penalty phases.

The court found that there were no violations of his rights under Brady with respect to testimony of the adult victim's former boyfriend and testimony of the babysitter. It was concluded that in both instances the undisclosed evidence was not exculpatory. The court found that there was no merit to appellant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because consistent theories had been presented throughout the guilt and penalty phase, there was no deficiency in the evidence presented by his attorney, there was no prejudice from exclusion of potential jurors, and testimony of additional mitigating witnesses would merely have been cumulative. The evidence of aggravating factors was strong and there was no reasonable probability that additional mitigation evidence would have changed the outcome. The court held that denial of a hearing on the petition for error coram nobis was proper because there was insufficient proof that the newly discovered evidence might have resulted in a different judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the application of the statute of limitations did not violate defendant's due process rights because defendant had the opportunity to initiate his petition.

The instant court found defendant failed to carry the burden of establishing his attorney was ineffective. The evidence did not preponderate against the post-conviction court's findings. Defendant also argued his trial attorney was ineffective at the sentencing phase. Defendant's trial attorney maintained that defendant's medical records did not show a diminished capacity or support a mitigated sentence. However, defendant contended his trial attorney never reviewed them until the day of the post-conviction trial. The instant court, on direct appeal, noted consecutive sentencing was based on the trial court's finding that defendant had an extensive criminal history and was a dangerous offender. Thus, had the medical records been introduced, consecutive sentencing would still have been warranted. Defendant's defense was self-defense, not insanity. Defendant failed to carry the burden of proving his trial attorney was deficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of bank robbery and sentenced in 1991. The State appealed from a judgment by Knox County (Tennessee) trial court reducing his sentence. The primary issue presented for review was whether he should have been sentenced under the 1982 Sentencing Act or the 1989 Sentencing Act. A secondary issue related to procedure and jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court, relying on the 1989 sentencing Act, treated the offense as a Class B felony, sentencing defendant to a Range III, 30-year sentence. He petitioned for postconviction relief. At the post-conviction hearing, he argued that because the elements of bank robbery most closely matched the elements of simple robbery under the 1989 Act, bank robbery it had to be classified as a robbery, a Class C felony.  Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-401. The trial court agreed and sentenced him to Range III, 15 years.  Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-112. The State had a right to appeal the trial court's granting of post-conviction relief.  Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-118 controlled the disposition of the case. The trial court erred by amending the judgment to indicate defendant was convicted of a Class C felony instead of a Class B felony. Remand for a recalculation of the sentence under the 1982 Act was essential to ensure defendant was not subjected to an ex post facto violation because the 1989 Act imposed a release eligibility of 45 percent, whereas the 1982 Act imposed 30 percent release eligibility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for a recalculation of the sentence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was identified as the triggerman. Three witnesses positively identified defendant as a perpetrator. Count 2 of the indictment alleged that defendant unlawfully and knowingly attempted to kill the victim. Count 2 was sufficient to charge attempted second degree murder.  Tenn.

The jury acquitted defendant of attempted premeditated and deliberate first degree murder as charged in count 1, but convicted him of attempted felony murder as charged in count 2. Attempted felony murder was not a recognized crime in Tennessee. The jury instruction given was not entirely inappropriate in a prosecution for an attempted homicide based on defendant's participation in a robbery. Nonetheless, it had no place in a prosecution of defendant for attempted second degree murder based on his personal responsibility.

He contended the officer's approach to his truck and subsequent request to exit it violated his Fourth Amendment rights and Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. He argued that because the initial approach and request were unconstitutional, the officer's subsequent observations of him as well as the results of any tests performed should have been suppressed. The State responded the approach and request of the officer were predicated upon specific reasonable and articulable facts justifying an investigatory stop. The appellate court agreed. Police went to the place of a disturbance and saw defendant's vehicle, matching the description provided them, pulling away. They stopped him and found he was drunk. He was convicted of driving under the influence. The investigating officer served the public interest in this matter. The nature and scope of the intrusion was slight.

The trial court dismissed and defendant appealed, arguing that his counsel failed to introduce an insanity defense and the recantation evidence tended to exonerate him and was evidence for mitigation. The court affirmed and ruled that defendant's counsel might have rejected the insanity defense because it resulted in another capital sentence in defendant's earlier murder trial in Oklahoma. The court held that it could not second-guess the tactical and strategic choices made by trial counsel unless those choices were uninformed because of inadequate preparation, and the reviewing courts indulged a strong presumption that the conduct of counsel fell within the range of reasonable professional assistance. The court also ruled that the exclusion of the recantation evidence had been &quot;previously determined&quot; on appeal and was not deemed relevant at sentencing because of the overwhelming evidence of guilt.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-202(a)(2), was constitutional and was not overbroad; (3) a photograph of the victim was properly admitted into evidence because the probative value of the photograph outweighed the risk of unfair prejudice; (4) the trial court did not err in failing to charge the jury regarding the lesser offenses of robbery and theft because the evidence did not warrant an instruction on either offense; (5) the statutory aggravator set forth in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204 (i)(5) was not unconstitutionally vague and could be understood and applied by the jurors; and (6) the trial court did not err by imposing consecutive sentences because the record supported the trial court's determination that defendant was a dangerous offender.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the indictment was sufficient to allege murder, pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-202(a)(2) (1991). The court affirmed in part, holding that: 1) defendant's constitutional rights had not been violated by state's offer of a plea bargain whose rejection left defendant exposed to the death penalty; and 2) the state was permitted to conclude that evidence about the victim and the impact of the victim's murder on the family as relevant to the jury's decision as to whether or not the death penalty should have been imposed. However, the court reversed and remanded the death sentence because the excluded psychiatrist's testimony concerning defendant's regret was material to show mitigating circumstances in the sentencing phase. The record reflected that the therapist was better able to articulate defendant's background history to the jury than was defendant, and the refusal to allow him to testify was reversible trial error.</SPAN></P>

He was not in custody when he made that statement. A plastic surgeon with experience in burn and hand injuries testified the burn was consistent with her hand being dipped in hot water. He opined the injury was compatible with physical abuse. The State was permitted to admit into evidence photos of the victim's injured hand. Also, the trial court gave a range of punishment instruction and disagreed that defendant presented newly-discovered evidence. After he was convicted, the appellate court found the motion to suppress was properly denied since defendant's Miranda rights were not violated and that the motion to exclude was also properly denied. It also found the surgeon qualified as an expert, admission of the photos was not error, the range of punishment instruction was properly given, he did not present newly-discovered evidence, the indictment was sufficient, and the evidence supported the conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded for a new trial. The court found plain error in the jury instruction on the range of punishment under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-201(b) (Supp. 1995). The instruction misled the jury as to the applicable law. The statute indicated that whether an individual was released from incarceration on his earliest release eligibility date was a discretionary decision made by the board of paroles. Deleting that part of the statute from the jury instruction gave an inaccurate statement of the law and misled the jury as to the likelihood of when defendant would have been released. The trial court also stated only the lowest number of years as the earliest release eligibility date. Because the jury as the triers of fact believed that the evidence sufficient to convict defendant of second degree murder and not voluntary manslaughter, the court upheld their verdict. The evidence was sufficient. The court agreed with the state that the trial court did not err by instructing the jury on the minimum release eligibility date for a mitigated offender.</SPAN></P>

He filed his original petition for post-conviction relief in 1990, which was heard and denied in 1991. In May 1996, petitioner filed a motion to reopen his post-conviction proceeding, pursuant to Tenn. Code. Ann. &sect; 40-30-217. That motion was denied without a hearing by a Williamson County (Tennessee) trial court. Petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner contended the trial court erred when it dismissed his motion to reopen his petition for post-conviction relief. His motion claimed a new constitutional right not recognized at the time of the first post-conviction proceeding, specifically, that the reasonable doubt jury instruction given at his trial had since been declared unconstitutional in a federal district court opinion. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-217(a)(1) stated that only two courts may establish new constitutional rights cognizable in a motion to reopen: the highest State appellate court or the United States Supreme Court. A federal district court was not included. The challenged reasonable doubt instruction had consistently been held to be constitutional by the Tennessee appellate courts. Petitioner also contended that the State, in 1990, promised to recommend a reduction of sentence to the trial court in exchange for his cooperation. He claimed he performed his part of the bargain, but the State did not. Even if true, this was not one of the statutory grounds to reopen. The appellate court concluded that petitioner did not allege a cognizable ground to reopen his first petition for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

Latent fingerprints were taken from the crime scene and identified as defendant's. According to defendant, the victim asked defendant twice if he had ever had sex with a man. The second time, they began to argue and the victim pulled a knife. Defendant stated he might have used it against the victim, in self-defense, and then taken the victim's money and rummaged through the house. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for mistrial. Defendant and his counsel were aware that the theft involved the victim's wallet. The fact that the State did not specifically reveal that the wallet apparently had a significant sum of money in it was not required by bill of particulars; there was no showing that the State deliberately withheld this information.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102. The court applied a three-step analysis and found that the statute of limitations was not tolled because defendant had a reasonable opportunity to present post-conviction claims and he failed to raise the issues of exculpatory evidence, the challenge to African-American jurors, and a suggestive lineup in a timely manner. The court held that defendant was not constitutionally or statutorily entitled to the effective assistance of post-conviction counsel. The court further found that an instruction to the jury on malice for a felony murder conviction was not required as it was implied as a matter of law from the killing during the perpetration of one of the listed felonies.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of automobile burglary and found to be a habitual criminal, receiving a life sentence.

The Anderson County Criminal Court, Tennessee, summarily dismissed the petition. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged the grand larceny plea was invalid because he was not advised of his right against compulsory self-incrimination nor warned that the conviction could be used to enhance a future sentence. The State moved to dismiss the petition because it raised an issue that was pending in the instant court in defendant's second post-conviction petition. Defendant responded to the State's motion to dismiss, but no further action was taken until defendant filed an amended petition and motion for an evidentiary hearing. The trial court dismissed the petition, holding the ground for relief had been previously determined against defendant. The instant court held defendant's second post-conviction petition related only to the habitual criminal case and could not be used as a means to resolve a claim that the grand larceny conviction was invalid. As a result, the ultimate dismissal of the second petition by the state supreme court was only a ruling in the habitual criminal case, not relating to any prior conviction. Thus, the dismissal did not operate as a previous determination of the validity of the grand larceny conviction. Defendant was entitled to an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of rape, and found to be a habitual offender by the Sullivan County Criminal Court (Tennessee). He subsequently filed two petitions for post-conviction relief, the first in 1987 and the second in 1990, both of which were denied. His pro se motion to reopen his first petition for post-conviction relief on May 8, 1996 was denied by the trial court and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. His first pro se petition for post-conviction relief was denied. On appeal, the trial court was affirmed in all respects except for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The case was remanded. An evidentiary hearing was conducted. The trial court found the issue lacked merit and denied the petition. That judgment was affirmed on appeal. Defendant filed a second pro se petition for post-conviction relief, which the trial court denied; finding it barred by the three-year statute of limitations. That judgment was affirmed on appeal. He petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, which the trial court denied. The trial court's denial was affirmed. He then filed a pro se motion to reopen his first petition for post-conviction relief. The trial court denied it, finding it did not present a colorable claim for relief. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-217(a), (b) (Supp. 1996). Because defendant did not file comply with the requirements of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-217(c), but apparently attempted to pursue an appeal by way of Tenn. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the statute imposing a mandatory 30-day incarceration period for child endangerment was unconstitutional as cruel and unusual punishment violative of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as the mandatory incarceration required by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-414 constitutionally denied her the granting of work release. The record reflected that a plea agreement was reached; thus, defendant waived appellate review of her sentence because she had not met the requirements of Tenn. R. Crim. P. 37(b)(2)(ii). The appellate court found that because the issue was not properly before it, the appeal should be dismissed. Even if defendant had properly reserved the issue for appeal, it was without merit, and the court could not conclude that the imposition of a mandatory 30-day sentence was disproportionate to the crime on its face. The general assembly had determined that the seriousness of the offense of driving while under the influence with children in the vehicle warranted a more severe punishment. The legislature had broad power to determine the nature and length of punishments for crimes and the court deferred to its authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate challenged his 1978 convictions for second-degree murder and criminal sexual assault. His convictions were affirmed, as was the denial of his first petition for post-conviction relief. The inmate's second petition alleged that the reasonable doubt instruction given at his trial was unconstitutional because the trial court used the phrase &quot;moral certainty.&quot; The court held that because the inmate's conviction became final before the enactment of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102 (repealed 1995), he had three years from July 1, 1986, to file a post-conviction petition. The 1995 Post-Conviction Act did not reinstate a filing period for post-conviction cases relative to convictions for which the former three-year post-conviction statute of limitations had already run. The court found that the inmate had a reasonable opportunity to bring his post-conviction claim before the enactment of the 1995 Act, but he failed to do so. Thus, the trial court properly dismissed the petition as being untimely filed. The court further held that the use of the phrase &quot;moral certainty&quot; in the context of the reasonable doubt instruction given at trial did not constitute an error.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 39-15-302 and he was sentenced such that the sentences for 10 of the counts ran consecutively. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence and found that the county court properly admitted the victim's testimony because she was not a consenting participant in the crimes, and was thus not an accomplice, and, therefore, no corroboration of her testimony was required. In addition, the court found that it was proper to admit into evidence a redacted version of defendant's tape recorded pre-arrest conversation, that the recording did not introduce other crimes evidence in violation of Tenn. R. Evid. 404(b), and that its admission did not violate Tenn. R. Evid. 403 or U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court held that defendant's post-arrest statements were properly admitted into evidence because the short amount of time that he was detained before a probable cause determination was made was not unreasonable and there was no evidence that the police purposely delayed the determination. Under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-115(b)(5), aggravating circumstances justified making part of his sentence run consecutively.</SPAN></P>

The court first held that there was no error in introducing evidence of defendant's exact blood alcohol content instead of evidence that it was merely over the legal limit because such evidence was relevant, material, and was not likely to lead to wild speculation by the jury. The court then held, however, that defendant was entitled to reversal and a new trial because the trial court's jury instructions unfairly relieved the State of its burden of proving defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court determined that the error in the jury instructions concerned the instruction to the jury that they were to presume defendant's guilt from his blood alcohol concentration, which impermissibly placed the burden on defendant to rebut his presumption of guilt.</SPAN></P>

Later the assistant district attorney clarified for the record that defendant's counsel had agreed to allow the State to amend the indictment and present it to the jury in its amended form. The record contained no written agreed order on the amendment. Trial counsel did not object and explained his silence by expressing his belief that the Rules of Criminal Procedure required a defendant's affirmative consent before an amendment would be valid. Without providing such consent, he was certain defendant would have prevailed on appeal. The appellate court held that it was clear that that tactical decision was an exercise of judgment based upon counsel's interpretation of the rules of procedure.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was originally convicted in 1973. His sentence was commuted in 1979; and, in 1994, the commutation was revoked. He filed the instant petition in 1995. Defendant contended that he was sentenced under a statute that was declared unconstitutional by the Tennessee Supreme Court and that, therefore, the sentence he received was null and void. The State of Tennessee claimed that defendant's petition was barred by the statute of limitations found in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102 (1990) (repealed). The court reversed and modified defendant's sentence to a term of life imprisonment. Defendant had been sentenced under 1919 Tenn. Pub.

On appeal of the denial of post-conviction relief, the prisoner contended that the trial court erred when it ruled that his petition for post-conviction relief was barred by the three-year statute of limitations, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102. The prisoner claimed that if his petition was barred by the statute of limitations, then the statute of limitations was unconstitutional as applied to him. In affirming, the court held that the prisoner's action was barred by the three-year statute of limitations period, which began to run on the effective date of Tenn. Code. Ann. &sect; 40-30-102 (1990). The court held that the Post-Conviction Procedure Act did not revive the prisoner's claim once it was barred by the statute of limitations.

The attorney testified at the evidentiary hearing regarding effective assistance and stated that, in hindsight he would have made certain objections regarding introduction of inadmissible evidence concerning defendant's participation in past illegal activities and would have consulted with a sentencing expert and a psychiatrist regarding defendant's previous work-related and automobile accidents. The court affirmed, finding that defendant received effective assistance under the Sixth Amendment. The trial counsel was not deficient in his performance because he did in fact object to the introduction of &quot;prior bad acts&quot; evidence, but such evidence was properly found to be admissible. The court concluded that trial counsel made a diligent effort to exclude evidence concerning defendant's uncharged illegal acts, despite the fact that it had been deemed admissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal of his sentence of death by electrocution for felony murder, defendant raised 13 issues for review. The court affirmed the sentence. The court held that prosecutorial discretion used in selecting candidates for the death penalty did not result in any constitutional deprivation. Defendant's challenge to the trial court's denial of his motion for recusal, based upon alleged bias or prejudice resulting from trial judge's participation in earlier robbery case involving defendant, was without merit because the record did not establish that the trial judge acted as a lawyer in any matter in controversy and there was no indication of bias. Because defendant gave explicit instruction to his trial counsel not to present further mitigating evidence nor make a closing argument and defendant was believed to be competent, there was no error committed in allowing the waiver of further mitigating evidence and closing argument. The Eighth Amendment did not require the presentation mitigating circumstances when defendant waived such presentation. The sentence was not imposed in an arbitrary fashion and was neither excessive nor disproportionate to death sentences imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner then filed an application for habeas corpus relief, or in the alternative, post-conviction relief. The trial court entered a summary dismissal of the petition after concluding that it was time-barred. The court noted that petitioner was not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus because his petition was not filed in the county in which he was incarcerated. Thus, in reviewing the trial court's judgment based upon the Post-Conviction Procedure Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-30-101 to 40-30-124, the court affirmed the dismissal. It held that the limitations period had expired and petitioner did not qualify for delayed filing under the Act because the application of the limitations period did not deprive him of a new constitutional right that required retroactive application. The court also held that petitioner's conviction was not constitutionally infirm due to the use of moral certainty phraseology in the jury instructions.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the statute was not unconstitutionally vague where the jury was not left to open speculation but was given an approximation of the sentences with sufficient definition; 2) the calculation of the minimum number of years to be served did not unfairly mislead the jury merely because that the actual time served might be longer and thus defendant was not deprived of due process, and (3) where there necessarily was a certain amount of overlapping between the three departments of government, the statute did not infringe upon the powers reserved for the judiciary.</SPAN></P>

His conviction was upheld on appeal. The inmate filed a petition for post-conviction relief more than three years after final appellate action. The trial court ruled that the action was barred by the statute of limitations and dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the inmate alleged that the trial court should have afforded him an opportunity to present evidence why the action was not filed earlier. He also alleged that a reasonable doubt instruction was unconstitutional. The court upheld the dismissal. It noted that the inmate's action was barred by the statute of limitations. There was no procedural basis for the trial court to hear the inmate's motions to rehear or reconsider after he filed an appeal from the trial court's initial decision because the notice of appeal invoked the court's jurisdiction.

The jury fixed defendant's sentence at life imprisonment for first-degree murder and the trial court imposed maximum sentences of 12 years each for the remaining offenses and ordered all sentences to be served consecutively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the indictment; the sufficiency of the evidence; the admission of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) evidence; and the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress blood samples obtained during the investigation. The language of the indictment provided constitutionally sufficient notice of the offense charged as well as suitable protection against double jeopardy. The proof in the record pointed the finger of guilt unerringly at defendant and defendant alone, and the proof was sufficient for a jury to have found the essential elements of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court properly analyzed the DNA typing evidence according to the Tenn. R. Evid. 702, 703, which pertained to expert witnesses. The evidence in the record supported the finding that defendant voluntarily consented to providing both blood samples. Any error created by the failure to provide the identity instruction was harmless. The trial court did not err by imposing maximum sentences for defendant's convictions for aggravated kidnapping and aggravated sexual battery and by ordering all three sentences to be served consecutively. Thus, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The inmate argued that the sentencing scheme violated the Separation of Powers Clause, Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 1, 2, and the determinate sentencing statute in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-211. On appeal, the court affirmed. Because the habeas corpus remedy was limited, the court held that the inmate's petition was properly dismissed as he failed to allege that the trial court was without jurisdiction or that his sentence had expired. Even if the inmate had made the necessary allegations, the court determined that his arguments were without merit. Although the inmate argued that power of the executive branch to determine eligibility for parole was violated by assigning an offender a range and corresponding release eligibility date, the court found that it was impossible to perfectly preserve the lines of demarcation between the branches. Assignment of a sentencing range and a release eligibility date did not violate determinate sentencing as granting parole did not end an inmate's sentence but merely altered the manner by which it would be served.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court stated that the rule in the case relied on by defendant had been codified at Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-202(b)(3). The court stated that his reliance on that rule was misplaced because it applied in cases where the prior convictions used for enhancement purposes had been overturned. The court stated that defendant sought to have the court review the validity of his prior convictions almost eight years after he had pleaded guilty. The court stated that any post-conviction challenge to the prior convictions was clearly time barred by the three-year statute of limitations.

The record showed that at a subsequent hearing, the inmate's attorney announced to the court that the inmate was going to strike his petition. After the inmate expressed assent thereto, the trial court concluded the proceedings. However, the technical record contained no order disposing of the petition, through withdrawal or otherwise. The court held that it had no jurisdiction to consider the issues the inmate had raised because: (1) Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-211(b) required the trial court to enter a final order upon the final disposition of every post-conviction petition; (2) the inmate's right to appeal from the disposition of a post-conviction proceeding was predicated upon the trial court's entry of an order; and (3) in the absence of such an order, the court had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.</SPAN></P>

The gun was turned over to police, and the police later questioned defendant at his mother's home. Defendant gave a recorded statement to the police in which he admitted to his role in the robbery. Defendant was not arrested or read his Miranda rights on that day. Defendant was arrested the following day, and after being read his Miranda rights, he gave a similar recorded statement. The court held that trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the statements. The first statement was not a custodial statement in which defendant was entitled to Miranda rights. Consequently, the first statement did not taint the second statement.

On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, Tenn.

The appellate court held that the evidence was sufficient, as the officer testified that defendant was &quot;very intoxicated&quot; and his ability to operate a motor vehicle was definitely impaired; &sect; 55-10-401 was not unconstitutionally vague, as the phrase &quot;under the influence of an intoxicant&quot; gave fair warning as to the prohibited conduct; and the sentence was not excessive, because measures less restrictive than confinement had been applied unsuccessfully, and confinement was necessary to avoid depreciating the seriousness of the offense and to protect society by restraining defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) prior to 1995, &sect; 55-10-408(b) provided that evidence that there was, at the time alleged, .10 percent or more by weight of alcohol in defendant's blood created a presumption that defendant was under the influence of such intoxicant; (2) the 1995 amendment to &sect; 55-10-408(b), which provided that evidence that there was, at the time alleged, .10 percent or more by weight of alcohol in defendant's blood was conclusive proof that defendant was under the influence of such intoxication, was unconstitutional; (3) because an unconstitutional amendment was void ab initio, it did not have the effect of amending or superseding the existing constitutional statute; and (4) the trial court was therefore correct in applying the act in existence prior to the 1995 amendment, in admitting the results of the breath test, and in treating them as raising an inference that defendant's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Criminal Court of Knox County (Tennessee), which convicted him of second degree murder in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-210(b) and sentenced him to 23 years of imprisonment pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-112(a)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court's jury instruction concerning self-defense was erroneous, that the prosecutor's cross-examination concerning pretrial preparation was unconstitutional, that the trial court made numerous erroneous evidentiary rulings, that the trial court's demeanor and conduct denied him due process of law, that numerous actions of the prosecutor constituted misconduct, and that his sentence was excessive. The court rejected defendant's contentions concerning his trial, finding that the asserted errors did not affect the verdict to the prejudice of defendant. However, the court ruled that the trial court did not consider all of the relevant sentencing principles that were applicable because defendant's proposed mitigating factors were denied. The court found that the relationship and history between the victim and defendant should have been considered because it played a role in the commission of the offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and modified his sentence to 17 years. The court ruled that the trial court's imposition of a 23 year sentence was excessive because the trial court's rejection of statutory mitigating factors concerning the history between the victim and defendant was improper and because defendant's personal history indicated he was a respected member of the community.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate alleged that guilty pleas he entered for his respective state convictions were not knowingly and voluntarily entered. On appeal, the court agreed that the petition was time-barred. The limitation period for each conviction was three years. The last state conviction was entered over eight years before he filed his petition. The court rejected the argument that the three year time period did not apply because he was not &quot;in custody&quot; at the time of filing. The court found that a person confined to a federal penitentiary was considered in custody in the meaning of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102 if the possibility existed that a state conviction placed a restraint on his liberty. Because the federal court had enhanced his sentence based on the Tennessee convictions, there was a restraint on his liberty. The court also rejected his argument that he was unaware of the three-year limitation period. Lack of knowledge was not an excuse for late filing. Finally, the court found that the new Post-Conviction Procedure Act, effective May 10, 1995, did not revive previously time-barred post-conviction relief claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed a judgment of a Shelby County trial court (Tennessee), which denied his petition for post-conviction relief without an evidentiary hearing and without appointing counsel on the ground that it was barred by the statute of limitations. The inmate had been convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to a term of 45 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate alleged that he was denied due process by a jury instruction on reasonable doubt and that his counsel was ineffective for having failed to argue that the instruction was unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the petition because it was not timely filed, because the issue had been waived for failure to present it in prior proceedings, and because the ineffective assistance issue had previously been determined. The court concurred with the trial court in its rejection of the inmate's claim that a reference to moral certainty in the jury instructions violated due process. Ignoring for the moment the procedural bars to the inmate's claim, the court observed that it had approved of the use of the term &quot;moral certainty&quot; in conjunction with the reasonable doubt standard as long as it was not used in connection with other qualifying phrases such as &quot;substantial&quot; or &quot;grave.&quot; The inmate had offered no proof that the reference to moral certainty lowered the degree of proof in violation of the due process clause. Because there was no error in the jury instruction, defendant's counsel could not be deemed ineffective for having failed to allege the ground as a means of relief.</SPAN></P>

He alleged he was being unlawfully restrained of his liberty because the statute under which he was sentenced as a habitual criminal, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-20-112, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of his rape conviction, the inmate had several prior convictions, including perjury, burglary, and felonious assault. Habitual criminal status at that time required three prior felony convictions, of which two were to be from a designated class. Perjury and burglary fell within the class. The inmate alleged that his burglary and perjury convictions could not be used to enhance his punishment to life imprisonment on his rape conviction because Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-20-112, as it existed at the time of his convictions for burglary and perjury, had been held to be unconstitutional. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. Habeas corpus relief was available only when it appeared upon the face of the judgment or the record that a convicting court was without jurisdiction or authority to sentence a defendant or that a defendant's sentence of imprisonment had expired. Here, the trial court had jurisdiction of the person and the subject matter; and it had the authority to make the challenged judgment, in each of the burglary, perjury, felonious assault, and rape cases. Thus, the judgments against defendant were not void. It was not necessary to consider &sect; 40-20-112.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for all necessary proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

Defendant complained of the trial court's denial of his application to a statutory work release program despite finding him eligible for the program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied defendant's application to the work release program because his employer, the State of Tennessee, refused to send his paycheck directly to the work release office. Defendant argued that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 41-2-128(c)(1)(C) (Supp. 1994) required only that a defendant agree to defray to the best of his ability the cost of incarceration and treatment and did not require a defendant's payroll check to be sent directly to the work release office. The court noted that before defendant's second offense for driving under the influence, the state supreme court declared the entire work release statute under &sect; 41-2-128(c)&nbsp;unconstitutional because it violated equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8; art XI, &sect; 8. The statute had made the work release program mandatory or discretionary depending on the population of the county involved. Because the amended statute contained the same language concerning a defendant's responsibility for costs, the trial court erred in denying defendant's application for the work release program.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged the decision of the Putnam County Criminal Court (Tennessee), which convicted two defendants of aggravated burglary, theft, and conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary and theft. A third defendant was convicted of a single count of aggravated burglary. Sentences were imposed for all the convictions after a single sentencing hearing. The jury assessed fines against defendants jointly and severally.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants committed a series of five burglaries in two counties. Two defendants challenged the length and the consecutive service of their respective sentences. Due to the many inconsistencies between the judgment forms contained in the record and the pronouncement of the trial court at the sentencing hearing as well as the incompleteness of the trial court's findings, the court reviewed defendants' sentences de novo without the presumption of correctness. The court reasoned that two defendants were sentenced to serve their sentences in the Department of Correction, and the trial court was without authority to impose restitution as part of a sentence of confinement. Further, the court held that the judgment forms were inconsistent with the trial court's orders as recorded in the transcript with respect to fines. The court held that the trial court made no findings relevant to consecutive sentencing except a single statement that consecutive sentences were warranted because of the extensive involvement of two defendants in the five burglaries. The court reversed the consecutive sentences, holding that consecutive sentencing was not justified in either case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendants' various convictions for aggravated burglary, theft, and conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary and theft. The court reversed the order requiring defendants to pay restitution. The court affirmed one defendant's sentence. The court modified two defendants' sentences to have the sentences run concurrently. The court modified a third defendant's sentence to give him credit for time served.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Criminal Court of Davidson County (Tennessee), which had found him guilty of one count of aggravated robbery and two counts of aggravated assault and had imposed concurrent sentences of 17 years on the robbery offense and 9 years on each assault offense. He alleged errors in a showup identification, admission of former testimony, and misapplication of sentencing enhancement factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant robbed a restaurant about a week after leaving his employment there. Although he wore pantyhose on his head, three former co-workers recognized him. The police located defendant walking only a few blocks from the restaurant and brought him to the restaurant where the co-workers identified him at a showup. The court held that there was no error in admission of the showup identification because it took place only a short time after the offense. One of the co-workers could not be found to testify at trial. The court found no error in admission of his preliminary hearing testimony under Tenn. R. Evid. 804(b)(1), even though evidence of his unavailability was presented by affidavit rather than direct testimony. The court found that the trial court had misapplied statutory sentencing enhancement factors. It had applied the factor that the offense involved multiple victims to each offense, although defendant was convicted of a separate offense as to each victim. It had further applied the factors that the offenses involved risk to human life and injury to victims although these factors were inherent in defendant's conviction of the offenses by means of a firearm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments of conviction but modified the sentences imposed by the trial court. Properly applying the enhancement factors, the court arrived at a sentence of 15 years for the aggravated robbery conviction and seven years for each of the aggravated assault convictions, to be served concurrently. It remanded to the trial court imposition of the proper sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the inmate's sole contention was that the statutorily mandated classification of a sex offender as a mentally ill person pursuant to Tenn.

Specifically, the inmate claimed that but for the classification, he would have already been paroled. The court held that habeas corpus relief was only available when a conviction was void because the convicting court was without jurisdiction or authority to sentence a defendant or that a defendant's sentence had expired and he was being illegally restrained. Because the inmate alleged only the unconstitutionality of &sect; 33-6-302 and did not allege that the convicting trial court lacked jurisdiction to convict or sentence the inmate or that the inmate's sentence had already expired, the trial court properly dismissed his habeas corpus petition.</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged that the jury's invalid use of the felony murder aggravating circumstance in determining his death sentence was not harmless error as found by the circuit court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed a cashier at a convenience store during a robbery. Defendant was convicted of felony murder and sentenced to death, which was affirmed on appeal. After his first petition for post-conviction relief was denied and such denial affirmed on appeal, defendant brought a second petition, alleging error in the jury's application of the felony murder aggravator to his conviction. The trial court denied relief, and defendant appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that while the jury's application of the felony murder aggravator was duplicative of the elements of the crime, and thus error, it was harmless. The court found that the one remaining aggravator regarding prior violent felonies was strong and supported by overwhelming proof, so that it significantly influenced the verdict. In addition, the state did not place undue emphasis on the invalid aggravator in its closing, and no additional evidence supporting the invalid aggravator was introduced at the sentencing phase. The mitigating evidence offered by defendant as to his use of alcohol and drugs at the time of the crime was not persuasive in light of the strong proof supporting the valid aggravator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate contended that he was entitled to a post-conviction hearing because the new Post-Conviction Procedure Act (Act) extended the filing period. The court observed that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-202 (Supp. 1996) reduced the statute of limitations for post-conviction relief to one year but provided an additional one-year grace period to file a petition. However, the new Act was not intended to revive previously barred claims. The court held that the grace period did not apply to the inmate's case because post-conviction relief was already barred by the statute of limitations in effect when the new legislation was enacted. The court concluded that the record did not preponderate against the trial court's finding that the inmate's ineffective assistance of counsel claim was barred for having been waived or previously determined. Regarding the inmate's challenge to the trial court's jury instruction on reasonable doubt, the court held that using the term &quot;moral certainty&quot; in conjunction with a particular description of reasonable doubt was a valid instruction. Furthermore, that issue had been waived for failing to raise it in a previous petition for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

The inmate contended that the trial court erred in finding that his petition for post-conviction relief was barred by the statute of limitations and that a new one-year statute of limitations violated due process, the Tennessee constitution, and case law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the inmate's convictions became final, the statute of limitations applicable to post-conviction proceedings was three years. The limitations period was subsequently shortened to one year by the Post-Conviction Procedure Act, which took effect before the inmate filed a petition for post-conviction relief. The new act provided a one-year period from its effective date to file a petition or a motion to reopen a petition for post-conviction relief. The inmate filed his petition a few weeks after the expiration of the one-year period. The court determined that states had no constitutional duty to provide post-conviction relief procedures and that the opportunity to collaterally assert constitutional violations that occurred during the conviction process was not a fundamental right entitled to heightened due process protection. The test of whether the one-year time period afforded the inmate due process was whether it provided him a reasonable opportunity to have his claimed issue heard and determined. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, finding that a one-year statute of limitations provided a reasonable opportunity for the presentation of post-conviction claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised numerous issues on the appeal from the post-conviction court's decision that summarily dismissed his third petition for post-conviction relief. The court affirmed the decision below. The record supported the post-conviction court's finding the majority of the claims raised on appeal were previously determined or waived, under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-112 (1990), by defendant's failure to present them for determination in any proceeding before a court of competent jurisdiction. With regard to defendant's contention that, in violation of his due process rights, he was forcibly administered &quot;mind-dulling&quot; medication during trial, the court found that the claim was barred by the three-year statute of limitations of &sect; 40-30-102 (1990). The liberty interest that arose from the involuntary administration of medication was first recognized in 1990. However, defendant first raised this issue in the state courts in his third post-conviction petition in 1995. Notwithstanding that the claim was time-barred, the court noted that defendant failed to show anywhere in the record that he was forced to take the medication or that there was even an objection to his being medicated.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the court upheld the denial of the motion to suppress. The court then held that evidence was sufficient to support defendant's convictions for felony murder. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment as to those charges. However, the court reversed defendant's attempted felony murder convictions because attempted felony murder was not considered a crime in the state. Nonetheless, the court held that defendant could be tried on charges of attempted premeditated murder, which the jury had not considered in lieu of its finding on the attempted felony murder counts. The court then held that any error in the admission of technically irrelevant victim's impact statements during defendant's punishment hearing was harmless.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner prisoner appealed from the order of the Circuit Court of Lauderdale County (Tennessee) that summarily dismissed as untimely his pro se application for post-conviction relief and which alleged that he received ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to his trial and conviction for the sale of cocaine and that &quot;moral certainty&quot; language in a reasonable doubt jury instruction at his trial violated due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner's conviction after a jury trial was upheld on direct appeal. More than two years later, the prisoner petitioned for post-conviction relief. The petition was dismissed under the one-year statute of limitations under the Tennessee Post-Conviction Procedure Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-201 et seq. (Supp. 1996), which took effect nearly 13 months before the prisoner filed his petition. The prisoner appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that, although the prior three-year limitations period of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102 applied at the time the prisoner's conviction was affirmed and that period had not expired at the time the petition was filed, &sect; 40-30-102 had been repealed in the interim and replaced by the Act's one-year limitation period. Thus, the petition was untimely because it was not filed within one year of the effective date of the Act. His constitutional claim about the reasonable doubt instruction did not come within an exception to the one-year period, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-202(b)(1) (Supp. 1996), because a reference to &quot;moral certainty&quot; in such an instruction was not per se unconstitutional and the jury charge as a whole comported with due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of a judgment of the Criminal Court of Davidson County (Tennessee), which dismissed his petition for writ of habeas corpus. The inmate alleged that his sentence was void because it was indeterminate, violating Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-211 (1989), and that the sentence violated the separation of powers clause of the Tennessee Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was serving a 15-year sentence for attempted first-degree murder. He contended that the release eligibility provisions under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-501 (1989) created indeterminate sentences, which were prohibited by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-211. He based that allegation on the discretionary authority of the Board of Paroles to either grant or deny parole. The court affirmed, finding that the inmate confused the terms sentence and parole. Even though released from confinement, a defendant continued in constructive custody until the expiration of the full term of his sentence. Thus, the sentence imposed by the sentencing court remained determinate. The parole board had no authority to determine the term of the sentence, but it did have discretion in deciding how it would be served. The laws regarding sentencing and paroles did not unconstitutionally confer judicial powers upon executive officers. The inmate's allegations, even if true, did not render his convictions void, but merely voidable. The inmate failed to establish that the sentencing court was without jurisdiction or authority to sentence him, nor was there any proof that his sentence had expired.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant received a sentence of 10 years in jail. He contended that the evidence presented at the trial was legally sufficient to sustain a conviction. The court found that the evidence was sufficient for finding that he was criminally responsible for the drug sale by aiding in the commission of the drug sale. The court further rejected defendant's contention that he was only guilty of simple possession or casual exchange. Next, defendant claimed that the prosecution's use of a peremptory challenge to dismiss a black prospective juror was racially motivated. The court held that the State, by demonstrating its peremptory challenge was not exercised to further a discriminatory purpose, properly rebutted defendant's claim of racial discrimination in the jury selection. Finally, the court found that defendant did not overcome the presumption of correctness that was given to the sentence that was imposed by the trial court.

The court held that testimony regarding defendant's lack of a license was inadmissible hearsay and the conviction for driving without a license had to be reversed and remanded. There was sufficient evidence from which a jury could infer that defendant was hiding out in order to evade arrest or prosecution. Furthermore, the jury was correctly instructed that they were not required to infer flight and flight alone did not support a finding of guilt. The issue of a double jeopardy violation in that the trial court used the same prior convictions to enhance his sentence that were used to previously convict him as an habitual criminal was waived because defendant agreed to the sentencing classifications at the sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-203(i)(5) (1982) was deficient without the limiting definitions, the court presumed that the state supreme court cured any constitutional defect by applying a narrowing construction to prior case law. Although the failure to fully investigate a defendant's background in preparation for a possible death penalty sentencing hearing was below the range of competence demand of counsel, the court found that defendant had explicitly instructed counsel not to confer with his family and not to oppose the death penalty. Counsel was not ineffective for not presenting any mitigating proof because defendant voluntarily requested none be made. The court found that failure of the state to hand over to defendant certain reports with names of other persons who might have knowledge of the murders did not undermine the outcome of the trial because there was no showing the documents would have led to favorable information.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a facially invalid conviction, regardless of whether it was a Tennessee case or a foreign case, could not be used for enhancement purposes.

At the time of the habeas corpus petition, the inmate was confined at a maximum security institution, where he was serving an effective sentence of 45 years for his convictions. About 12 years later, he filed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The petition alleged that his sentence was indeterminate and, as such, violated Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-211 (1989) and that his sentences violated the separation of powers clause of Tenn. Const. art. II. The trial court dismissed the petition. The court held that the inmate's sentence imposed by the sentencing court remained determinate. The court further held that the Tennessee Board of Paroles had no authority to determine the term of the sentence, but it had discretion in deciding how that sentence was to be served. As such, the court held that the inmate's sentence was not indeterminate. Additionally, the court found that Tennessee's sentencing and parole laws did not unconstitutionally confer judicial powers upon the Board.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, convicted of second degree murder, contended on appeal that the state's failure to preserve a knife and notify the defense of its disappearance violated his constitutional rights, that a jury instruction was erroneous, and that the participation of the victim's attorneys as special prosecutors violated his due process rights. The court reversed the conviction, holding that participation by special prosecutors who represented the victim in a civil matter arising from the same incident giving rise to the criminal prosecution was a violation of defendant's rights under the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and the Law of the Land provision of Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court also ruled that the disappearance of the knife did not violate defendant's constitutional rights because the defense was aware that a knife was missing during trial and did not object, and the exculpatory nature of the missing knife was speculative because defendant did not request that the knives be tested for blood or fingerprints. The jury charge contained language, which sufficiently encompassed the specific intent required for the attempt.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that he was denied a fair trial due to the impartiality of the trial judge. Defendant argued that the trial judge, who also sat in on the post-conviction proceedings, was neither neutral nor detached and had developed a personal bias against him. The court affirmed defendant's convictions and his death sentence. The court held that relief under the Post-Conviction Procedure Act was granted only when there was an abridgment of any constitutional right during the course of the guilt or sentencing phase of the trial. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-105. The court held that because the alleged instances of misconduct occurred during the hearing on the post-conviction petition, defendant did not qualify for relief. The court also found no merit in defendant's argument that the trial judge corresponded with his family members because although they sent the judge a letter, the judge never responded.</SPAN></P>

Following his sentence of death by electrocution was handed down, defendant sought review of the judgment. Defendant argued that that the indictment omitted an essential element of felony murder and that the evidence was insufficient to find that the murders were heinous. The court held that defendant was not surprised or hampered in defending the counts that alleged defendant killed the victims, that he killed the victims during the perpetration of one of the enumerated felonies, and that the killings were unlawful. The court reasoned that the submission hearing illustrated defendant knew the nature of the charges to which he pled guilty. Further, the court found that defendant inflicted severe mental pain in the victims and that the record was sufficient beyond a reasonable doubt that the murders were heinous, atrocious, and cruel. The court also found that the trial court properly refused to instruct the jury on life without the possibility of parole as a sentencing option.</SPAN></P>

The inmate insisted that the Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989 was unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers doctrine. The inmate asserted that the legislature unconstitutionally delegated its legislative power to set punishment to the judicial branch pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-501. The inmate argued that the statute allowed the judicial branch to impose indeterminate sentences in direct contravention to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-211. The inmate contended that the trial court should have treated his habeas corpus petition as a petition for post-conviction relief. On appeal, the court determined that the inmate had not raised the issue asserted in his petition for habeas corpus, therefore, the issue was waived. The court stated that the sentences imposed on the inmate were not indeterminate simply because he could be granted or denied parole. The court explained that a petition for post-conviction relief was required to be filed in the county of the inmate's conviction and the inmate had filed in a different county.</SPAN></P>

Cocaine was found in defendant's pocket and bags containing cocaine and marijuana were found in a search of the vicinity. Other evidence was found in a search of defendant's car. On appeal, the court affirmed, noting, inter alia, that the officer had sufficient reasonable articulable suspicion to conduct a Terry stop and had probable cause to arrest defendant under &sect; 55-8-132. The court held that the search of defendant was proper as a search incident to a lawful arrest and that probable cause to search the car existed.

The only aggravating circumstance found by the jury was that the murder was committed during the perpetration of a robbery. Defendant's conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. On appeal, the court found that defendant presented no claim deserving of post-conviction relief. Every claim presented was barred by the statute of limitations. Defendant failed to demonstrate that any claim was later rising or that he has been precluded a reasonable opportunity to present it in a state forum. Moreover, some of defendant's claims had been waived for failure to present them in an earlier petition and many had been previously determined.

The court affirmed, holding first that the petition could have been dismissed for the fact that the inmate's petition contained neither a copy of the legal process upon which the restraint was based nor a satisfactory reason for its absence, in violation of Tenn.

The sentencing procedure by which a trial court had to first determine the appropriate sentencing range that determined the release eligibility percentage did not encroach on the executive branch's power to determine parole eligibility.

The inmate argued that Tennessee's sentencing laws violated the separation of powers clause of the state constitution and that the sentences authorized were indeterminate in nature and contrary to law. The inmate argued that the judicial function in the sentencing process encroached on the power of the executive branch to determine an inmate's parole eligibility. On appeal, the court stated that the inmate had failed to provide an adequate record for a meaningful review on appeal. The court concluded that the trial court had not erred when it denied the inmate habeas corpus relief. The court determined that the judicial function of setting sentencing range was not an unconstitutional encroachment on the powers of the executive branch. The court stated that the fact that the Board of Paroles (Tennessee) could grant or deny parole did not convert a determinate sentence into an indeterminate sentence. The court concluded that the trial judge had not erred by denying the inmate's request for habeas corpus relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of aggravated rape and first degree murder. More than eight years later, petitioner filed his petition for postconviction relief, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and violations of newly recognized constitutional rights. In the alternative, he sought habeas corpus relief. Petitioner also alleged several other constitutional violations. The State moved to dismiss the petition because it was filed more than three years from the date of the last appellate action. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the application. The statute of limitations for petitioner's convictions expired in 1991. None of petitioner's claims fit within the Burford exception to the three-year statute of limitations. Initially, the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and the unconstitutionality of the felony murder statute were not new constitutional grounds for relief. These claims had always been available to petitioner. Thus, petitioner's claims failed to meet the second prong of Burford that the grounds for relief actually arose after the limitations period would normally have commenced.</SPAN></P>

The State gave defendant and co-defendants notice it would seek a conviction for first degree murder committed during the perpetration of a felony, and, if they were convicted, the State would seek a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. The state contended that the felony murder aggravating circumstance under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204(i)(7) (Supp. 1994) could be used to enhance a life sentence to a life sentence without the possibility of parole in a felony murder case when the State did not seek a death sentence. The court agreed. The &sect; 39-13-204(i)(7) aggravating circumstance could constitutionally be used to enhance a life sentence to a life sentence without the possibility of parole, because there was no United States or Tennessee constitutional provision, statute, rule, or common law decision, which required the class of defendants eligible for a life sentence without the possibility of parole to be narrowed.</SPAN></P>

His convictions became final on January 7, 1991. In January 1996, petitioner filed a pro se petition for post-conviction relief. A Shelby county trial court (Tennessee) dismissed the petition, finding that it was not filed within the statute of limitations. Petitioner appealed as of right, contending that the trial court erred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Five years after his convictions became final, petitioner filed a pro se petition for post-conviction relief, alleging that his convictions were void because the jury had been charged with an allegedly unconstitutional reasonable doubt instruction. The trial court dismissed his petition as being untimely filed. Relying on Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-201 (Supp. 1996), petitioner argued that the 1995 Post-Conviction Procedure Act allowed him an additional year within which he could file a petition. Section 40-30-201 provided that any person having ground for relief recognized under the Act had at least one year from May 10, 1995, to file a petition or a motion to reopen a petition under the Act. On appeal, the court pointed out that it had previously held that the language of &sect; 40-30-201 did not apply to petitioners who were already barred by the three-year statute of limitations that was in effect prior to the Act. Petitioner's petition was clearly barred by the three-year statute of limitations. Further, petitioner's complaint about the jury instruction did not fall within the very narrow exceptions to the limitations period, as provided by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-202(b).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was found guilty of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. His conviction was affirmed on direct appeal. The inmate filed a petition for post-conviction relief, alleging a number of constitutional violations in his trial. The issue on review was whether the trial court erred by dismissing the inmate's pro se petition without an evidentiary hearing after finding that the statute of limitations had expired. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that the inmate failed to file his petition within three years of the date of the final action of the highest state appellate court to which an appeal was taken, as required by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102 (repealed 1995). Applying rules developed by the Tennessee courts to determine whether the inmate fell within a narrow exception to &sect; 40-30-102, the court determined that the statute of limitations had expired long before the inmate filed his petition. The court concluded that any errors in the instructions at the punishment phase of the inmate's trial were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the inmate was not sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>

After his conviction, the inmate filed a pro se petition to set aside his prior convictions on grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and on appeal. In the alternative, he sought habeas corpus relief. The trial court dismissed his application for post-conviction relief without an evidentiary hearing. On appeal, the court held that the inmate's appellate counsel made references to the pleadings which could have been more competently drafted by able counsel. The court determined that the trial counsel failed to adequately research and prepare and failed to present all claims might have required some elucidation. Moreover, the court determined that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel covered a broad area and almost always required both amendment and evidentiary hearing. The court held that the inmate should have the benefit of counsel, have the opportunity to amend the petition, and, if proof was necessary to support his claims, be afforded an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-101 et seq. (1990) or the period under the new act because it was filed over three years after the date of the inmate's conviction. The second petition was premature because it was filed prior to the conviction being affirmed on direct appeal. Furthermore, the inmate's allegations in his second petition that his sentence was unconstitutional should have been raised on direct appeal. The failure to do so resulted in such ground for relief being waived.

A jury found no mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial to outweigh the five alleged aggravating circumstances and sentenced defendants to death for the murder of one of the victims. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the evidence did not support any of the multiple convictions. Defendants also challenged the aggravating circumstances, which were the bases for their death sentences. The court affirmed. First, the court held that a rational jury could have found the evidence sufficient to support defendants' multiple convictions with one exception. The evidence did not support dual convictions dealing with the larcenies of personal property because the record did not indicate that the larcenies occurred at separate times. Thus, the petit larceny counts must have been merged with the grand larceny counts. Second, although two of the five alleged aggravating factors were invalid, the court held that the erroneous application of the two was harmless error. The evidence did not support application of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-203(i)(6) (1982) and &sect; 39-2-203(i)(7) (1982). Nevertheless, the proof supported that one of the murders was heinous, atrocious, or cruel in that it involved torture or depravity of mind, pursuant to the former &sect; 39-2-203(i)(5) (1982), and that the murders were committed during defendants' escape from lawful custody, pursuant to &sect; 39-2-203(i)(8) (1982).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed both defendants' convictions and death sentences, but also merged their petit larceny convictions.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the possible invalidity of the warrant did not affect whether defendant was properly convicted for felony escape. The evidence showed that defendant was being held for a felony and that he escaped. Defendant also claimed that the two-year sentence imposed by the trial court was excessive. The court found that the applicable enhancement factors sufficiently outweighed the mitigating factor, and therefore, the maximum sentence was proper.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held a hearing and dismissed the petition. The court affirmed on appeal. The court first rejected petitioner's argument that the death sentence was improper. The death penalty for felony murder was not reversible even though the jury considered an improper aggravating circumstance. The jury would have imposed the same sentence in the absence of the invalid aggravating circumstance. Next, the court held that petitioner's argument regarding the jury instructions and prosecutor's closing argument could not be considered because the issue had been previously determined or was not raised below.

The state filed a motion to have the trial court recuse itself, but the trial court denied the motion. The court reversed the order regarding the state's use of the death penalty and affirmed the order that denied the state's recusal motion. The court held that it was the sole function of the prosecutor to decide which cases that he would seek the death penalty. The trial court had no authority to condition a ruling on whether or not the prosecutor sought the death penalty. The jury, and not the trial judge, had the responsibility to determine whether or not it would sentence defendant to death.

While serving his life sentence, petitioner filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus.

The court noted that habeas corpus relief in criminal cases was limited to those instances where the petitioner's conviction was void or he was being held beyond the expiration of his sentence. Since petitioner's claims did not show that his judgment was void or that his sentence had expired, habeas corpus relief was inappropriate. Furthermore, since the application was treated as one for post-conviction relief, the court concluded that it was untimely, and dismissal on this ground was correct as well.

Code Ann. &sect; 39-14-103.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first count alleged that defendant engaged in the theft of services by fraud from many individuals as part of a larcenous scheme thereby constituting a single act. The second count alleged similar actions against a shipping company. The theft of property indictments alleged that defendant exercised control over property without the owners' effective consent with the intent to deprive the owners thereof. Defendant alleged that count I transformed allegations of numerous misdemeanors into a single felony count, that counts I and II failed to describe the wrongdoing, and that counts III and IV did not describe the goods received. The trial court granted his motion to dismiss. The court disagreed and reversed the dismissal. The elements of each of the crimes alleged were included in the four counts of the indictment. It was not the purpose of the indictment or the bill of particulars to adequately prove the crime or to elect among alternative legal theories for the theft. The complex nature of the facts underlying these offenses could present a significant burden to the State at trial; the charging document, however, was not defective.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the petition for post-conviction relief. Affirming, the court held that the inmate's claim as to the malice inference was waived pursuant to Tenn.

The court found that impermissible language in the premeditation instruction did not relieve the State's burden to prove deliberation, and that element was proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to sell, possession of cocaine with intent to deliver, and possession of drug paraphernalia. Affirming, the court found that, although the conclusory allegation of the confidential informant's veracity failed to satisfy the veracity prong of the test for search warrant affidavits, there was sufficient police corroboration to establish veracity. During six hours of surveillance, police observed five transactions of what appeared to be drug sales and they knew of defendant's prior drug arrests. The officer's observation of defendant's commission of a felony provided probable cause to pursue and arrest him. This constituted exigent circumstances warranting entry into defendant's home and excusing compliance with the knock and announce requirement. That civil forfeiture proceedings were not joined with the criminal trial did not bar defendant's conviction because the forfeiture did not qualify as punishment for criminal purposes. The court remanded for resentencing because, although the trial court announced a minimum Range II sentence, the judgment reflected a Range I classification. This conflict required clarification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate challenged, pursuant to Tenn. R. App. P. 3(b), a judgment of the Wayne County Circuit Court at Waynesboro (Tennessee) denying his writ of habeas corpus. The inmate was incarcerated after being convicted of rape, aggravated kidnapping, petit larceny, and assuming official character. He claimed that his sentences were void and he was being unlawfully held because an unconstitutional judge presided at his preliminary hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed that the judge that presided at his preliminary hearing did so in violation of Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1. Further, the inmate claimed that the circuit court did have jurisdiction to hear his petition for writ of habeas corpus. The State claimed that the circuit court's order of dismissal was correct. After a review of the record, the court affirmed the circuit court's order of dismissal. The court held that habeas corpus relief was available only if it appeared upon the face of the judgment or the record that the convicting court was without jurisdiction or authority to sentence the inmate, so that the inmate's sentence had expired. The court found that the inmate's conviction was merely voidable. The court held that where a judge's election to the bench was not proper and he had presided over a defendant's trial, his judicial acts were valid and binding until he was removed from his position in the manner proscribed by law. The inmate, by failing to raise this issue in the municipal court or at trial, had acquiesced to municipal court's exercise of jurisdiction. Accordingly, the circuit court did not have jurisdiction to hear the writ.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment of conviction. The court found, inter alia, that the statements made to the police were properly admitted. The evidence showed that defendant was properly given his rights and that he waved his right to an attorney. His asking if he should have an attorney was not the equivalent of requesting an attorney, and the police were not required to stop the questioning. Further, the challenged statements were obtained within 24 hours of defendant's arrest.

Defendant was convicted of first degree felony murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Defendant appealed, but the court affirmed. The indictment clearly charged defendant as a principal in the crime of felony murder, and the evidence was sufficient to support her actions as such. Under the felony-murder doctrine, defendant could be convicted of first degree murder because she willingly participated in the felony of stealing the victim's truck. The record was devoid of any evidence to support a conviction for criminal facilitation, and no instruction was warranted. The post-death evidence was relevant to prove defendant's participation in the events, and its probative value was not substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice. Although the jury selection procedure was not in accordance with the Rules of Criminal Procedure, the error was harmless. The proof was overwhelmingly sufficient to uphold the jury's application of the aggravating factors that the crime was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel and that the victim was killed to prevent reporting of the felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated rape of a victim less than 13 years of age. Defendant brought a petition for post-conviction relief, arguing that the sentence was illegal because an element of the offense of aggravated rape, the age of the victim, was used again to enhance his sentence. The State filed a motion to dismiss the petition because it was filed outside the three-year statute of limitations applicable to the petition. The trial court granted the State's motion and dismissed the petition without an evidentiary hearing. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the petition was untimely and therefore properly dismissed by the trial court. The court further held that defendant's argument that his sentence was illegal was a claim that should be raised in the county of incarceration through a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued in his appeal that: the evidence was insufficient; the trial court erred in charging the jury on defendant's release eligibility because the information stated in the charge was incorrect and the charge was misleading; and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-201(b)(2), concerning instructing the jury on possible penalties, violated the Tennessee and United States Constitutions. The victim testified that he saw defendant for several seconds standing three feet in front of him, he later saw defendant again and briefly struggled with him, it was about 7:30 in the morning and there was plenty of light, and only an hour and a half passed between the time he saw defendant in his house and the time that defendant was arrested. When defendant was arrested, the police officer found items stolen from the victim's home in defendant's pockets. There was ample evidence to support the jury's finding defendant to be the perpetrator of the burglary. The trial court did not err and defendant was not prejudiced by the jury instruction as the trial court followed the requirements of the applicable statute as to what had to be included in an instruction considering punishment of a defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the denial of defendants' petitions for post-trial relief, finding that the trial court erred in dismissing one defendant's petition because the Post-Conviction Procedure Act did not as a matter of law ban multiple suits attacking the same conviction. Thus, the trial court had jurisdiction to determine the issues even if the appeal from the previous petition was pending in a higher court. Defendants had presented constitutional grounds for relief with the regard to the use of false testimony and suppression of exculpatory evidence by the state. The court found that the state did not show that the statute of limitations, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-112 (repealed by 1995 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 207, &sect;1), barred the defendants' petitions because they were brought within the effective date to file post-conviction petitions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from a trial court of Montgomery County (Tennessee), which denied defendant's second petition for post-conviction relief. Defendant was convicted of two counts of aggravated sexual battery and sentenced to concurrent 20-years terms. His conviction was affirmed by the court, and his first petition for post-conviction relief was denied by the trial court and the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied the second petition for post-conviction relief because it did not contain any claim for relief of a constitutional dimension and because it was barred by the statute of limitations. The State then filed a motion with the court requesting that the trial court judgment be affirmed pursuant to Tenn. Ct. Crim. App. R. 20. On appeal, defendant claimed that his sentence was unconstitutionally disproportionate to his crime, in violation of Tenn. Const. art. I. &sect; 16 and U.S. Const. amend. VIII, because it was greater than the sentence he would have received if he had been convicted and sentenced for the same crime under the current statute. The court rejected this claim under the doctrine of stare decisis because the Supreme Court of Tennessee had previously rejected the exact constitutional claim. The court also found that there was no merit to defendant's similar claim that his sentence violated equal protection and due process because there were others who were sentenced for the same crime but not sentenced under the prior law. Finally, he failed to show that the three-year statute of limitations denied him a reasonable opportunity for his claims to be heard.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that the trial court had jurisdiction over both the subject matter and person and nothing in the record demonstrated that the trial court's actions were unauthorized. The court reasoned that habeas corpus relief was available in Tennessee only when it appeared upon the face of the judgment or the record of the proceedings upon which the judgment was rendered that a convicting court was without jurisdiction or authority to sentence a defendant or that a defendant's sentence of imprisonment or other restraint had expired.

No objection was interposed, and no motion was made to strike such question. At the conclusion of such evidentiary hearing, the trial court issued its order summarily finding defendant in criminal contempt for using profane and obscene language in a courtroom. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the word &quot;profane&quot; was defined as writing, speaking, or acting with irreverence toward God or holy things; (2) while the language referred to by defendant at the pretrial evidentiary hearing was vulgar and coarse, such language did not constitute profane swearing or cursing under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-9-107 because it was not irreverent toward sacred things; and (3) defendant's conduct was not willful under Tenn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant in his petition for post-conviction relief alleged that he should have been charged with driving without a valid driver's license rather than driving on a cancelled license.

The trial court denied the petition. On appeal, the court found that in neither defendant's petition, the transcript of the evidentiary hearing, defendant's brief, nor defendant's response to the State's motion for summary affirmance had defendant adequately explained why his issues concerning double jeopardy and the constitutionality of the statutes were not previously raised.

The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions beyond a reasonable doubt. While defendant's statements were admissible as nonhearsay as they circumstantially showed his mental state toward the victims at the time the statements were made, the exclusion of that evidence did not constitute reversible error as there was extensive direct evidence and circumstantial evidence of his mental state admitted at trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had a conviction for reckless driving and two convictions for driving while under the influence of an intoxicant within a five-year period. He claimed the Act was unconstitutionally vague, his right against double jeopardy was violated, he was improperly denied a jury trial, and the trial court did not properly consider principles of equity when it determined that he was a habitual offender. Upon review, the court found that the Act was not unconstitutionally vague because it created three clear categories of habitual offender. The court observed that proceedings under the Act were civil in nature. Because the revocation of his driving privileges was remedial in nature and not intended to have the effect of imposing &quot;punishment&quot; in order to vindicate public justice, defendant was not subjected to double jeopardy. Entry of summary judgment was not an improper denial of the right to trial by jury because there was no genuine issue of material fact. The court concluded that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-613(a) of the Act removed all discretion from a trial court in a decision to revoke a person's license once he was determined a habitual offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that declared defendant a habitual offender under the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, there was testimony that defendant and the victim, who had been defendant's partner in a contracting business, had been engaged in a heated dispute. The victim, who both eyewitnesses testified was unarmed, challenged defendant to fight. Defendant produced a fight and fatally stabbed the victim. In challenging his conviction, defendant contended that the offense amounted to voluntary manslaughter. The court found that the evidence was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to have found the elements of the murder offense beyond a reasonable doubt, particularly the element of a knowing killing of another person. The court further found that any error in the State's use of defendant's prior felony conviction for incest to impeach defendant's credibility was harmless because defendant failed to show how he was prejudiced by the trial court's ruling to allow such evidence. Moreover, there was no error in the trial court's comments to the jury during their deliberation, as the remarks were not an undue intrusion into the jury's exclusive province. In affirming, the court found that the sentence imposed on defendant was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate contended that the court's holding regarding a jury instruction was in conflict with substantial changes in the law, citing cases holding similar instructions to be unconstitutionally vague. The inmate acknowledged that the cited cases, as federal court opinions, were not binding on the court. He argued, however, that it was a waste of state and federal resources to deny him relief until he moved into federal court. The court held that it had a duty to follow the holdings of the Tennessee Supreme Court. Thus, until that court or the U.S. Supreme Court declared otherwise, Tennessee Supreme Court cases were binding in declaring the relevant instruction to be appropriate. The court rejected the inmate's contention that, based on the case law existing then, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-112(b) required a subjective, personal waiver a ground for post-conviction relief. The court observed that there was no clear indication that the statute was interpreted to require a personal waiver before the case upon which it based its interpretation was decided. In addition, the Tennessee Supreme Court had applied the objective waiver standard to a person similarly situated to the inmate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the denial of his second post-conviction petition for relief, petitioner filed a petition for habeas corpus in the federal district court. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the State on two of the three issues. The third issue had not been decided. Petitioner filed his third petition for post-conviction relief. Affirming the judgment on appeal, the court held that the district court was a court of competent jurisdiction to decide the issue of whether the imposition of the death penalty violated the Eighth Amendment because the felony murder aggravator was invalid. The court found that the use of the aggravator was not invalid because petitioner's conviction did not rest solely on felony murder. Rather, petitioner's conviction rested on a combination of felony and premeditated murder. Thus, there was no need to reweigh the aggravating factors. The court also held that the district court's decision was a ruling on the merits because petitioner was accorded a full and fair hearing. The court also upheld the trial court's use of the phrase &quot;moral certainty&quot; in its jury instruction, finding that the instruction clearly stated the burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

At least four of these purchases were from defendant himself. At one point he told an undercover police officer not to buy from any dealer but him. Defendant was found guilty at trial of one count of sale of cocaine and subsequently pled guilty to the remaining three counts in exchange for an agreement by the State as to the number of years of his sentence. The trial court denied defendant's request for a community corrections sentence stating that defendant was a role model for black youths in the area who subsequently were serving time in jail for drug charges. The trial court also noted the need for deterrence. Defendant filed a motion for postconviction relief from the sentence but subsequently dismissed the motion on an agreement by the State to allow defendant to file a delayed appeal. The court held that: (1) the State did not have the power to grant a delayed appeal, but because defendant was without recourse because of his dismissal of his postconviction relief petition, the court would hear his appeal; and (2) the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for community corrections.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the custodian of driving records testified that defendant's license was revoked before he committed the offenses. The state police had the authority to conduct roadblocks under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-7-104, which gave the state police the duty to enforce all laws regulating the use of Tennessee highways. Additionally, there were no laws prohibiting the use of roadblocks for drunk driving detection. Defendant did not inform the trial court that he was not prepared for trial, thus, he waived his argument that he did not receive a fair trial because he did not know the trial would start the same day the jury was selected.

Although the trial court only summarily addressed defendant's request for investigative and expert services, the result was consistent with the determination that all issues had been previously determined or waived. The trial court properly held that 14 issues were waived because defendant's allegations that he did not knowingly forgo his grounds for relief did not rebut the presumption of waiver under Tenn.

Fourteen of defendant's claims were previously determined, including the sufficiency of the premeditation and deliberation shown for first degree murder; issues of ineffective assistance of counsel; and the jury charge regarding aggravating circumstances.

Defendant attempted to attack the conviction through a certified question of law. The State argued that the defendant did not properly preserve the matter for appeal. The court agreed and dismissed the appeal. The court held that defendant failed to comply with Tenn. R. Crim. P. 37(b)(2)(i) by not clearly identifying the scope and the limits of the legal issue reserved. There was nothing in the records that actually constituted a certified question of law. Instead, the court noted that defendant's motions raised multiple issues with no indication of which one he desired the court to address. The court held that without an explicit statement of a certified question, neither defendant, the State, nor the trial court could make a meaningful determination of whether the issue sought to be reviewed was dispositive of the case. The court held that no issue beyond the scope of the certified question would be considered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of jury verdict entered in the trial court Sullivan County (Tennessee) for convictions for the aggravated child abuse, a class B felony pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-15-402 (Supp. 1994), and making a false report to an officer, a class A misdemeanor, under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-16-502(a)(1)(C) (1991).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated child abuse after the jury determined that she had inflicted serious bodily injury, under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-11-106(a)(33)(1991), upon her grandson. She also was convicted of providing false statements to officers. On review, appellant contended that the evidence was insufficient for the finding of aggravated child abuse because the state failed to prove the necessary element of serious bodily injury. She also contended that &sect; 39-16-502(a)(1)(c) was void as it was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. The court affirmed the conviction for aggravated child abuse but reversed and dismissed the conviction for false reporting. The court held that: (1) the evidence, comprising the testimony of witnesses and photographs of the victim showing bruises, scabs, and other wounds clearly established that the victim had experienced serious bodily injuries and that he had suffered psychic injuries as a result of such abuse that left him forlorn, submissive, and withdrawn; but that (2) the prohibition set forth in &sect; 39-16-502(a)(1) (C) did not encompass false responses to police initiated inquiries.</SPAN></P>
