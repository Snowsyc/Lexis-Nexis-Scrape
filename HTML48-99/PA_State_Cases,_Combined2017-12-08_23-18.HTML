<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the trial court (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of two counts of homicide by vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, two counts of homicide by vehicle, and two counts of driving while under the influence of alcohol or controlled substance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lost control of his vehicle and collided with a utility pole. The two passengers in the vehicle were killed. While at the hospital, police officers ordered that a blood sample be taken from defendant. The test showed that defendant was intoxicated. Defendant was convicted of two counts of homicide by vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, two counts of homicide by vehicle, and two counts of driving while under the influence of alcohol or controlled substance. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. On appeal, the court vacated defendant's conviction and remanded for a new trial. The blood test was constitutionally invalid because officers did not have probable cause to believe that defendant was driving under the influence of alcohol. Neither the officers nor hospital personnel detected any signs of alcohol consumption by defendant. Defendant did not smell of alcohol and no one observed defendant driving recklessly. There were no alcohol bottles or cups in defendant's vehicle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer, who did not have probable cause to believe defendant was drunk, asked defendant for a blood sample. Defendant complied with the request, but was not told the test could be used against her. Defendant's motion to suppress was denied based on the implied consent provision of the Motor Vehicle Code, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1547(a)(2). The court reversed and remanded defendant's conviction for driving under the influence because the court determined the implied consent provision was unconstitutional under the federal and state constitutions. The implied consent provision violated the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV, because it authorized a search, a blood test, without a requirement of probable cause that a suspect was drunk. Searches authorized pursuant to the implied consent provision violated Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 because the provision did not require any evidence of a crime upon which the blood test could be based. The court could not conclude that defendant voluntarily consented to the blood test because defendant was not put on notice of the possible criminal ramifications of the blood test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded defendant's conviction for driving under the influence because the blood test administered to defendant was done so without her consent and in violation of her constitutional rights. The implied consent provision for a blood test was unconstitutional under the federal and state constitutions because it allowed a blood test to be taken without probable cause that a crime had been committed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, mother and daughter, were involved in an automobile accident with defendant driver, while he was working for defendant employer. Plaintiffs initiated a personal injury action against defendants. The trial court entered judgment for plaintiffs. Plaintiffs challenged the award alleging that the trial court abused its discretion denying additur. Defendants contended that the trial court erred in denying their motion for change of venue because plaintiffs' husband and father was employed by the clerk of courts. Defendants also alleged the trial court erred in excluding evidence that plaintiffs were not wearing seat belts. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The amount of the verdict did not shock the court's conscious, so plaintiffs' additur request was properly denied. Defendants did not offer any evidence or proof that the relationship between plaintiffs and an employee of the clerk of courts would prejudice them. Pursuant to 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 4581(e), evidence of plaintiffs' failure to wear seat belts was properly excluded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, defendant pharmaceutical companies appealed an order from the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), finding that plaintiff wrongful death litigants properly established personal jurisdiction over defendants. Defendants claimed that, as successor corporations, they were not liable for the actions of their predecessor corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A corporation sold an x-ray contrast dye that was used at various medical facilities. Defendants corporations, through various mergers and transactions, obtained the corporation's trademark and patent rights and sold the dye. Plaintiff individuals brought wrongful death and survival suits against defendants. The trial court found personal jurisdiction existed. Defendants appealed, claiming that the forum-related actions of the predecessor corporation could not be attributed to them. Defendants claimed that jurisdiction had to be based on the forum-related activity of the defendants themselves. The appellate court affirmed, finding that the long-arm statute was not violated and due process was not offended. The court held that because defendants became the corporate embodiment of the predecessor corporation, defendants were liable as successor corporations for the prior corporation's product line. The court held that because the predecessor corporation purposely directed its product at forum residents, and the litigation arose directly from the drug's manufacturer and distribution, maintenance of the suit in the forum did not offend due process and was constitutionally sound.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment finding that personal jurisdiction over defendant corporations existed in plaintiff wrongful death litigants' suit because defendants were the corporate embodiments of a predecessor corporation. Defendants were liable for the actions of the predecessor corporation and because the corporation directed its drug to forum residents, personal jurisdiction existed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision from the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County (Pennsylvania), which entered judgment of sentence to pay the costs of prosecution imposed following his conviction of 43 counts of violating the Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Act and 43 counts of violating The Dental Law, 63 P.S. &sect; 120, et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued first that The Dental Law was unconstitutionally vague in its definition of the duties reserved for performance by licensed hygienists. Defendant contended that the language of the statute did not delineate whether the duty of cleaning teeth above and below the gum line was reserved exclusively for a licensed dental hygienist or whether an unlicensed practitioner, for instance, could perform a portion of the hygienist's functions. Defendant also contended that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdict of guilty to both The Dental Law violations and to the medicaid fraud charges. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's arguments. The court held that the commonwealth court had upheld the very provision of The Dental Law challenged by appellant in his void-for-vagueness argument. The court also held that the Commonwealth produced sufficient evidence to support the guilty verdicts to violations of both The Dental Law and the medicaid fraud statute. Accordingly, the court affirmed the judgment of sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was charged with the murder of an eight-year-old girl. Appellee filed a request for pretrial discovery under Pa. R. Crim. P. 305 for the name of the confidential informant, referred to in the state trooper's investigation report, who provided the state trooper with information concerning the chief of police, who was a suspect. The state trooper refused to disclose the confidential informant's identity. The lower court issued orders that appellant reveal the identity of informant and precluded the state trooper from testifying as to any aspect of the case. On appeal, the court determined that the disclosure of the informant's identity was relevant, would be helpful to appellee in the preparation of his defense, and was essential to a fair determination of the cause. The failure of the state trooper to disclose the informant was a failure of justice and a prejudice to appellee because it prevented him from preparing a viable defense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County (Pennsylvania), which convicted defendant of violating Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 73, &sect; 1684 (1989) after defendant refused to allow government inspectors to open two bags of pine bark mulch for inspection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two agents from the Bucks County Department of Weights and Measures (Department) sought to open two of defendant's bags of pine bark mulch for inspection in order to determine whether the weights and measurements listed on the packages were accurate. Defendant refused the inspection because the agents refused to pay for the bags. Defendant was subsequently fined pursuant to Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 73, &sect; 1684. The court vacated defendant's conviction for violation of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 73, &sect; 1684. Defendant had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Department's actions. Defendant was personally aggrieved by the conviction for hindering the duties of the inspector. The court held that the search and seizure provisions of the Weights and Measures Act (Act), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 73, &sect;&sect; 1662, 1665, under which the agents were operating, were unconstitutional as applied to businesses that were not the subject of close government regulation. The lawn and garden supply business was not a closely regulated business. The effect of the Act was to abolish the warrant requirement as to a vast number of industries that engaged in ordinary commercial activities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's conviction. Defendant had the right to refuse inspection of his goods because the search and seizure provisions of the Weights and Measures Act were unconstitutional as applied to the lawn and garden supply industry, an industry that was not closely regulated by the government.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant electric company sought review of an order from the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County (Pennsylvania), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee developers and held that appellant received a conditional fee interest in property rather than a fee simple absolute when the property was conveyed. The court further held that the railroad company abandoned the rail line when it conveyed the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee developers brought an action to quiet title with regard to property conveyed from a railroad company to appellant electric company. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee. On appeal, the court reversed the order granting summary judgment and remanded the case for trial. The court determined that the instruments of conveyances were intended to transfer a railroad right of way and not a fee simple interest. The court held that the railroad company only secured a right of way for railroad purposes by virtue of the instruments of conveyance and therefore the only interest it could pass was a railroad right of way. The court found that a jury question existed because a triable factual dispute existed as to whether the railroad company intended to abandon the line and whether it actually abandoned the line. The court concluded that so long as the owner of the right of way, even if a non-railroad, continued to use the line for railroad purposes, the right of way would not be deemed to have been abandoned.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for aggravated assault from the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania). Defendant urged that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. Defendant also challenged the constitutionality of his sentence, contending that aggravated assault is a lesser included offense of attempted murder and must therefore have a smaller maximum sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant abducted a woman and threatened her at knifepoint. He was interrupted and restrained by a passerby, allowing the victim to call the police. At trial, defendant was convicted of aggravated assault, simple assault, indecent assault, terroristic threats, recklessly endangering another, and possessing the instruments of a crime. On appeal, defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to convict him of aggravated assault. The court held that the fact that defendant did not carry out his threats did not preclude the jury from finding that he had the intent to carry them out. Furthermore, the trial court properly instructed the jury that an attempt to commit serious bodily injury was necessary for a conviction. Finally, defendant contended that aggravated assault is a lesser-included offense of attempted murder. As such, defendant urged that the maximum penalty for aggravated assault was unconstitutional for being double the maximum sentence for attempted murder. Without addressing the substantive issue, the court held that defendant had waived the issue by failing to raise it before the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant provider challenged a decision from the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (Pennsylvania), which allowed a court in equity to hear a cause that involved the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law (MVFRL). Appellant contended that appellee insured's claim for medical coverage was precluded from being heard in equity by the MVFRL and that the trial court improperly awarded appellee attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee insured was injured in an automobile accident. Appellant provider paid medical benefits for nearly a year before terminating coverage. Appellee filed a suit in equity to enjoin the termination and compel appellant to pay future medical expenses. Appellant filed a request to transfer the case out of equity as the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law (MVFRL) controlled the issue. The request was denied and a decree, which ordered appellant to continue paying appellee's outstanding and future medical costs and awarding attorney fees to appellee, was entered. Appellant sought review, contending that the case was improperly heard in equity and that it was error to award attorney fees. The court held that, in order to protect appellee from having to relitigate the issue of medical coverage, equity jurisdiction was properly asserted. Furthermore, the court held that there was nothing in the MVFRL to preclude the application of equitable relief to appellee's claim. Finally, the court held that as there was ample evidence that appellant acted in bad faith when it denied coverage, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1716 of the MVFRL provided for the award of attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the trial court, to hear appellee insured's claim in equity and to award attorney fees to him, was affirmed. The court held that no statutory provision prevented the trial court from hearing insured's claim in equity, which also served to prevent appellee from having to relitigate the issue of provider's liability over and over again. And, the court held that attorney fees were expressly permitted by statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The income of appellee estate's trusts supported appellant wife for her lifetime, and thereafter, appellant daughter for her lifetime. The trusts owned commercial property, which produced lease income. The estate had insufficient funds and owed state inheritance tax, repair costs, administrative costs, including commissions for appellee executor and counsel fees, and real estate taxes. Appellee executor filed a petition to obtain permission to pay inheritance tax, administrative costs, repair costs, and real estate taxes out of appellee estate's income. The trial court granted appellee executor's petition and directed the costs paid from appellee estate's income and appellants as income beneficiaries challenged the order. The court affirmed that the real estate taxes, repairs, and business privilege taxes were payable from income. However, the court reversed and held that the inheritance tax had to be paid out of principal because the testator's will clearly expressed this intention. The court also reversed, remanded, and held that administrative fees had to be apportioned between income and principal under 20 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8111(b).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of robbery, in violation of 18 Pa. Cons.

Appellant was sentenced to imprisonment of not less than five years or more than ten years for robbery and sentenced to concurrent, lesser terms for criminal conspiracy and possession of an instrument of crime. Appellant contended that the evidence was insufficient, the offense did not implicate the mandatory sentence provisions of 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9713(a), and the statute was unconstitutional because it violated due process and equal protection guarantees and the constitutional proscription against cruel and unusual punishment. The appellate court affirmed the judgments of sentence. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to show that appellant, by use of an unpraised knife, threatened his victim with serious bodily injury. The court held that appellant's averments of unconstitutionality could not prevail and the mandatory sentence provisions of &sect; 9713(a) were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents, who were mentally retarded, sought review of the decision of the Court of Common Pleas, Adams County, Orphans' Court (Pennsylvania), which terminated their parental rights pursuant to Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents' rights to their children were terminated by the state. The petition for termination did not designate a particular section of the Adoption Act, Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2511, et seq., under which termination was appropriate. The trial court entered conclusions of law and a decree nisi finding that the requisites of &sect; 2511(a)(5) had been met. Appellants filed exceptions challenging the trial court's factual findings. The trial court dismissed the exceptions and rendered absolute the decree terminating appellants' parental rights. Appellants sought review arguing &sect; 2511(a)(5) violated the equal protection and due process clauses, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, whether public policy mediated against the termination of parental rights in the absence of a finding of fault, and whether the evidence supported the termination of appellants' rights. The court reversed the order finding that to terminate appellants' rights would sever the relationship and injure the children and that upon applying &sect; 2511(a)(5), maintaining the status quo best served the children's needs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order terminating the parental rights of appellant parents' was reversed because no precedent existed that prevented the children from living outside appellants' home while maintaining a relationship with them, and no one advocated returning the children to appellants' custody. Since the children benefited from the relationship with appellants, and terminating their rights would injure the children, maintaining the status quo was best.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer refused to pay one of appellee victim's medical bills that resulted from a motor vehicle accident, claiming the treatment was not a necessary and reasonable expense.

Appellant refused to pay and the trial court imposed Philadelphia, Pa. Local Rule 170 sanctions for failure to settle. The jury returned a verdict for the same amount and judgment was entered for that amount plus interest. Appellant argued that Rule 170 should not be applied because the jury's verdict was not 20 percent greater than the trial court's recommended settlement. Appellant argued that it was deprived of due process and the right to a jury trial, Rule 170 was unconstitutional because it duplicated provisions of rules and statutes, and that it did not apply to first-party lawsuits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner manufacturer claimed the respondent Commonwealth's capital stock and franchise tax discriminated and petitioned the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for relief. The case was remanded to determine whether the tax imposed by 72 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7602 was unconstitutional and the proper remedy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held that the &sect; 7602 discriminated against interstate commerce and remanded the matter back to the commonwealth court to determine if the tax was compensatory. If it was not compensatory, it was unconstitutional and the commonwealth court had to determine the appropriate remedy. The parties agreed, and the commonwealth court held, that the tax was not a compensatory tax. After reviewing its options, the commonwealth court recommended the invalidation of &sect; 7602(a) as it related to manufacturing within the State in the limited &quot;headquarters context.&quot; The commonwealth court also recommended invalidation of the exemption in its entirety, but left the task of amending the tax to the legislature so that it could incorporate its intentions and constitutional considerations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax was not compensatory and was, therefore, unconstitutional. The commonwealth court recommended invalidation of a portion of the tax, and later invalidation of the entire exemption with amendment to be made by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

The trial court upheld the arbitration panel's award. On appeal, the court held that the arbitration panel did not exceed its authority because while 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 371(d) provided that appellee was required to give written notice to appellant containing specifications of disputed issues, appellant did not submit specific issues to the arbitration panel, but only broad proposals that essentially called into questions all the past practices of the parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A toddler died after receiving an injection of general anesthesia in petitioner's dental office. Thereafter, respondent board suspended petitioner's dental license after finding that he had not complied with its regulations by, inter alia, failing to have appropriate monitoring equipment in his office. On appeal, petitioner's primary contention was that respondent's regulation requiring appropriate monitoring equipment was unconstitutionally vague because it did not give him, or other practitioners, notice of what specific equipment was considered appropriate. The court agreed with petitioner, holding that the term &quot;appropriate monitoring equipment&quot; was unconstitutionally vague because it did not provide a reasonable standard by which petitioner was supposed to act. The court reasoned that the lack of clear guidance in respondent's regulation as to what constituted &quot;appropriate&quot; monitoring equipment would lead to a purely subjective criterion which may reflect merely the personal or professional views of individual members of respondent board.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order vacated, the term &quot;appropriate monitoring equipment&quot; was unconstitutionally vague because it did not provide a reasonable standard by which petitioner was supposed to act; case remanded for the imposition of reasonable sanctions based only on the remaining violations.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed the denial, concluding that there was no ground to challenge for unreasonable search and seizure under the federal or state constitutions because none of the challenged provisions automatically resulted in an inspection of the property without the owner's consent; there was no due process violation because appellant was provided with adequate opportunity to challenge any adverse decision with regard to his property; and there was no double taxation because the required permit fee was not a tax.</SPAN></P>

Because the substitute nomination was made by a political body rather than a political party, it was governed by 25 Pa. Cons.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought a death benefit from her husband's retirement account that was payable to her due to her status as her husband's principal beneficiary. Petitioner contended that the State Employes' Retirement Board (SERB) erred in affirming an award of interest for a period of 39 days rather than for a period of 235 days. The court affirmed, observing that petitioner's husband was not an active member of the State Employes' Retirement System at the time of his death. It could not be said that SERB wrongfully withheld benefits due petitioner when its duty to pay benefits either did not yet arise or was to be performed within a reasonable period of time. The award of 39 days' interest was based on a reasonable and proper construction of the contract underlying petitioner's entitlement to death benefits and state law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer began improving lots in a proposed four-phase residential development project. Unsatisfied with the tax assessments of the lots, the taxpayer appealed to appellee board, and then to the trial court. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in finding that an assessment had to be made on every individual lot in phase one of its development once a lot was sold. The court found that once lots were sold from phase one, that phase had to be assessed on an individual lot basis. Consequently, the court affirmed phase one assessments because appellant, who needed to challenge the value and give a value to each individual lot rather than the entire phase, failed to present sufficient evidence to rebut the prima facie validity of appellee's assessment. The case was remanded to the trial court to take into consideration the indirect costs in valuing phases two through four.</SPAN></P>

Cons. Stat. &sect; 7651.306(b), that appellant submit a blood sample for DNA testing. Appellant argued the Act violated the doctrine of separation of power, was unreasonable search and seizure under U.S. Const. amend. IV, violated ex post facto prohibitions of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 and U.S. Const. art I, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate raised various constitutional challenges to the requirement under DNA Detection of Sexual and Violent Offenders Act (Act), 35 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7651.306(b), that appellant submit a blood sample for DNA testing. The court held Act did not violate separation of powers doctrine because the legislature had not affected appellant's eligibility for parole or altered the length of his sentence. The court held that Act was not an unconstitutional ex post facto enhancement of appellant's sentence. There was no ex post factor violation if the Act was not penal in nature but merely procedural. Act, &sect; 306, permitting denial of parol for refusal to comply with Act's sample collection requirement, was not ex post facto sentence enhancement. Infliction of an additional punishment, within the parameters of appellant's original sentence, was not ex post facto. The court held Act's requirement for blood sample was not a violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV when balanced against the government's interest in furthering a legitimate need. Blood testing was a relatively minimal intrusion, which was outweighed by the special public interest in maintaining an identification data bank.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed appellant inmate's petition because DNA Act's blood sample requirement did not violate separation of powers doctrine when appellant's sentence was not affected. No ex post facto violation when provisions of DNA Act were not penal in nature but merely procedural. DNA Act's requirement for blood sample did not violate the Fourth Amendment because testing was a minimal intrusion when balanced against a legitimate public need.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and held that under the general rules of statutory construction, the Act's use of the word &quot;any&quot; included both tax claims and municipal claims as claims which a municipality could assign to a party that was a stranger to the original transaction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimant received workers' compensation benefits, and later applied for unemployment compensation benefits, which were denied. Respondent Unemployment Compensation Board of Review (UCBR) determined that claimant failed to meet the eligibility requirements under &sect; 401(a) of the Unemployment Compensation Law (Law), 43 Pa.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers operated public, for-profit golf courses and appealed the order denying an appeal of a local amusement tax ordinance enacted by appellee township. The ordinance assessed a tax on appellants' facilities because the facilities charged admission, but exempted any activities that the ordinance declared exempt. Appellants alleged that the ordinance was unconstitutional and violated appellants' rights under the U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. The appellate court affirmed and held that appellee acted within its discretion in implementing the amusement tax. The ordinance was presumed constitutional and appellants failed to establish that the ordinance plainly violated the constitution. The ordinance did not treat similarly situated entities differently but distinguished between admission fees charged at private, nonprofit entities and public, for-profit entities. The appellate court found that the status and purposes of the entities were different and that appellee had a rational basis for excluding private, non-profit entities from the tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant was injured in the course of his employment. Claimant was treated by provider, his physician, for the injury. Claimant brought a workers' compensation action, and the workers' compensation judge (WCJ) found, after admitting deposition testimony from another physician, that provider's treatment of claimant was unreasonable. Petitioners, claimant and provider, appealed from an order dismissing provider's petition for review of the adverse utilization review (UR) determination. The court ruled that if a party failed to abide by the time limits set forth in 34 Pa. Code &sect; 131.66, then the evidence could not be admitted, relied upon, or utilized in the proceedings or referee rulings pursuant to 34 Pa. Code &sect; 131.63. Further, the court held that as the testifying physician's deposition was taken over four months before provider filed his petition for review of the UR determination, the deposition was not taken in compliance with the time requirements and should not have been admitted or relied upon by the WCJ. The court reversed the order, concluding that the WCJ erred in relying on the deposition in the UR proceedings as it represented inadmissible hearsay.</SPAN></P>

In quashing the appeal, the trial court found that appellants had failed to demonstrate that they were specifically harmed by the granting of the variance because they did not live or represent anyone living in the vicinity of the proposed signs. The appellate court held that it was within the city's power to provide in Code &sect; 14-1806(1) for taxpayer standing to challenge city zoning actions.

The court dismissed petitioner's complaint and held petitioner lacked standing.

Petitioner did not establish that prison officials were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs, and thus could not show any violation of U.S. Const. amend. VIII. Requiring inmates to pay a minimal fee for their medical care did not amount to deliberate indifference. Petitioner failed to show a U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Bedford County (Pennsylvania), denying her oral petition to compel the trial court to permit her to vote any available ballot in a state primary election despite appellant's lack of registration with either the Republican or Democratic political party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an independent voter not associated with either the Democratic or the Republican party, challenged the trial court's denial of her oral petition to compel the local election board to permit her to cast her vote in a state primary election being held that day. The trial court concluded that &sect; 702 of the Pennsylvania Election Code, 25 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2812 (1937), which restricted the right to vote in any party's primary elections to those persons registered as members of such party, did not violate appellant's constitutional rights of free association, to vote, or to equal protection of the laws. On appeal, the court agreed. As a registered non-partisan voter, appellant claimed not that the state's voter registration requirements were onerous but that they resulted in disenfranchisement of principled voters who desired no ongoing affiliation with a particular political party. The court followed controlling United States Supreme Court precedent and held that the type of interest asserted by appellant did not outweigh the interests of political parties and the state as embodied in a duly-enacted closed method of conducting primary elections. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's denial of appellant's oral petition seeking the right to vote in a state primary election even though appellant was not registered with either the Republican or Democratic party. The state statute permitting only party-affiliated voters to cast ballots in the primary election did not effectively disenfranchise appellant or rob her of her constitutional right to freely associate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court considered whether the interstate commerce and due process clauses required the state to include property, payroll and sales of subsidiaries in the three-factor apportionment formula and, if not, whether the state statutory scheme mandated administrative relief. It concluded that petitioner corporation had not met its burden as to its constitutional claims. Petitioner corporation had not demonstrated a due process violation where it asserted that if the total property, payroll and sales of the unitary business enterprise were included in the fractions of the three-factor formula, its tax due would be approximately 44.5 percent less than the figure arrived at by the Board of Finance and Review (Board). The court held that a variance of this magnitude between the allocated and actual shares of petitioner's activity in the state, although not of constitutional proportions, required statutory relief under 72 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7401(3)2.(a)(18). Thus, the court reversed the orders of the Board and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Common Pleas Court of the County of Chester (Pennsylvania), which denied her appeal and reinstated a one-year suspension of her operating privileges imposed pursuant to the Interstate Compact, section 1581 of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1581.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment which reinstated a one-year suspension of appellant's operating privileges imposed pursuant to the Interstate Compact, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1581, and which denied her appeal. Appellant licensed Pennsylvania driver was convicted in New Jersey for driving while under the influence of alcohol (DUI). New Jersey notified the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in compliance with the Interstate Compact, and appellant's Pennsylvania license was suspended for one year as a result of the New Jersey conviction. The court rejected appellant's argument that the Interstate Compact violated the double jeopardy, due process, and equal protection clauses of the United States and Pennsylvania constitutions. First, driving was a privilege and not a right. Second, the suspension of appellant's driver's license was a collateral civil consequence of her DUI conviction and, thus, did not constitute punishment within the meaning of the double jeopardy clauses. Finally, appellant could not maintain a claim for discriminatory enforcement of a facially neutral statute like the Interstate Compact without evidence of a discriminatory effect and discriminatory purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment, which reinstated a one-year suspension of appellant's operating privileges imposed pursuant to the Interstate Compact and which denied her appeal. Appellant's challenges to the constitutionality of the Interstate Compact on the grounds that it violated the double jeopardy, due process, and equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions were without merit.</SPAN></P>

The order was reversed insofar as it allowed suspension of payments to provider from the date of employer's filing of a Utilization Review Petition through the WCJ's decision pursuant to the supersedeas provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 77, &sect; 531(5) and &sect; 531(6). On appeal, claimant successfully contended that based on the Sullivan decision, the Board erred by allowing suspension of medical payments to provider prior to the WCJ's determination. The Sullivan court held that the supersedeas provisions violated constitutional due process protections under U.S. Const. amend. XIV because they allowed employers to stop payments for medical treatments pending review before giving employees an opportunity to dispute the allegations.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the statute did not impose twice the normal tax liability on a nonexempt party because liability for payment of the realty transfer tax was joint and several, dischargeable by the parties.

The appellate court reversed the lower court's judgment. The appellate court held that the Heart and Lung Act clearly provided that eligible employees were to be compensated at their &quot;full rate of salary,&quot; which the appellate court interpreted as gross pay. However, because of collective bargaining agreements, appellee city was not required to retroactively compensate temporarily injured uniformed employees at a rate of 100 percent of their gross pay.

The court held that because this issue was raised for the first time on appeal, it was waived. The court concluded that respondent's determination that &sect; 271.211(e) did not apply to petitioner's pre-1988 permit was contrary to the plain language of the regulation.

The court stated that petitioner had the burden to show that under no state of facts could the classification further any conceivable legitimate state goal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant registered voters challenged the decision of the Common Pleas Court, Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), which sustained the preliminary objections, filed by the county elections department and a citizens committee, regarding lack of subject matter jurisdiction, in an action involving the adoption of a home rule charter and an election contest, under the Election Code, 25 P.S. &sect; 3456.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The general assembly enacted Act 12, 16 P.S. &sect;&sect; 6101-C to 6113-C, revising the procedure for a second class county to adopt a home rule charter. Under that legislation, a charter commission drafted a proposed charter that was adopted by a slim margin in a primary election. Seeking to have the adoption of the charter declared unconstitutional and illegal, appellant registered voters filed a petition to contest the primary election, challenging the manner in which Act 12 was enacted and alleging violations of campaign finance law. They did not allege any defect in the conduct of the election. The county elections department and a citizens committee filed preliminary objections by demurrer, requesting a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction; the trial court sustained the objections. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the Election Code, 25 P.S. &sect; 3456, only allowed challenges based on illegality when the illegality was a violation of those provisions of the Election Code dealing with the conduct of an election. Appellants' challenges did not have anything to do with casting, computation, or return of the vote.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, because election contests could only be brought regarding matters pertaining to the election process itself, such as the conduct of balloting, the tabulation of results, and the return of results. Appellant registered voters did not challenge any aspect of the conduct of the election, thus the trial court properly sustained the preliminary objections and properly dismissed the petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant licensee challenged an order of trial court that affirmed a liquor control board finding that appellant permitted improper entertainment on its premises in violation of 47 P.S. &sect; 493(10). Appellant contended that &sect; 493(10) was unconstitutionally vague and violated its rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV because the improper conduct proscribed by the statute was incapable of being discerned in advance; and violated its freedom of expression rights under U.S. Const. amend. I. The court rejected appellant's argument on the ground that appellant was aware that the board consistently interpreted the statutory provision to mean that nude dancing was prohibited in places where alcohol was sold. The court held that the board's prohibition against nude dancing in licensed liquor establishments did not violate the first amendment as the commonwealth had plenary power to regulate conduct pertaining to liquor sales, the prohibition furthered an important government interest, the prohibition was content neutral and the restriction was no greater than essential. Accordingly the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed because the court determined that appellant's fourteenth amendment rights were not violated as appellant was aware that the board consistently interpreted the statutory provision to mean that nude dancing was prohibited on its premises and the prohibition did not violate appellant's first amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the intent of the legislature in enacting &sect; 8304(b)(7) was to provide some remedy for the past discriminatory practice of forced maternity leave, and that the one-year period for commencing a purchase after eligibility to purchase was an effort by the legislature to make it as easy as possible for individual victims of past discrimination to take advantage of the opportunity to purchase service credit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A hearing examiner recommended petitioner committee member's permanent removal from the credit committee of a credit union based on findings that petitioner failed to conduct the loan approval process of the committee in accordance with credit union bylaws and failed to observe statutory loan procedures.

On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. Under the Credit Union Code, 17 Pa. Cons.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent issued an order that revoked petitioner's license to practice medicine because he committed medical malpractice by engaging in immoral, unethical, and unprofessional conduct.

The court found no merit in the argument because the romantic relationships began during the course of the physician-patient relationships.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners coal owners challenged a regulation designating portions of their land unsuitable for mining and requested that the court enjoin enforcement of the regulation as an unconstitutional taking. Respondent commonwealth filed a motion for summary judgment contending that the regulation did not constitute a taking as the unsuitable designation was adopted for a public purpose and did not deprive petitioners of all beneficial use of the land. In order to determine whether a taking occurred the court held that the applicable regulated land standard formula divided the interest in coal taken by the amount of land subject to the regulation. The court held that it was unable to apply the formula as there was no evidence on the record pertaining to the value of the coal estate prior to the unsuitable designation, as to whether the estate had a separate use from the non-regulated portion of the land, or whether all of its economic benefit was lost as a result of the taking. Accordingly summary judgment was denied because genuine issues of material fact remained as to whether a taking occurred.</SPAN></P>

They argued that petitioners lacked standing and that the claims set forth in the petition for review involved non-justiciable political questions pursuant to the enrolled bill doctrine. The court dismissed the petition for review with prejudice. The disputed legislation dealt with various aspects of public utility regulation. The version of the bill that was reported out of the legislative conference committee was significantly different than the original bill. Nevertheless, there was no clear constitutional violation, because senators and representatives were not mislead by the bill's title, and they were on notice as to the bill's contents. The fact that the bill encompassed more than one subject was not a violation of the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee township enacted an ordinance that imposed a moratorium on new subdivisions and certain land development for a period of one year, while appellee revised its Comprehensive Plan and zoning, subdivision and land development ordinances, thereby preventing continued development from defeating the intended effect of the revised plans and ordinances. The ordinance expired by its own terms in one year. Approximately two weeks before the new plan and ordinances were enacted, appellant land owners submitted preliminary subdivision and development plans to the zoning officer for review. The plans were rejected as they failed to comply with the pending ordinances, and the moratorium was still in effect. The court agreed with the trial court's conclusion that although the power to enact moratoria on subdivision and land development was not expressly authorized by statute, the legislature, through the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. &sect;&sect; 10101-11202, conferred broad authority upon municipalities to regulate land use, and that the power to enact moratoria was incidental to the powers of regulation expressly granted by the code.</SPAN></P>

The board ordered petitioner to cease and desist the prohibited activity and ordered him to pay a fine. Petitioner sought review of the board's order. The court affirmed the board's decision because 24 P.S. &sect; 6502 was not too vague and, therefore, petitioner should have known that he had to be licensed before he conducted the courses. The court held that the bartending courses did not constitute a &quot;private tutorial&quot; exemption under 24 P.S. &sect; 73.42(6) because there was no evidence of private, individual, or personal instruction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants filed an application with appellee zoning board challenging the validity of the minimum lot area requirements for single-family homes permitted in agricultural zoning district.

Appellee concluded that the larger minimum lot sizes for single-family homes in the agricultural zoning district than the residential zoning districts served the goal of preserving the prime agricultural land and that such requirements were neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. The lower court affirmed appellee's decision. Appellants again sought review. Appellants argued that appellee had the burden of establishing extraordinary justification to uphold the validity of the ordinance and that appellee failed to meet that burden. The court disagreed and ruled that the extraordinary justification standard was inapplicable to the case. The record supported a conclusion that the ordinance constituted a zoning for density intended to promote the preservation of the prime agricultural land.

Petitioner contended that the commonwealth had no authority to participate in the Violent Incarceration and Truth-in-Sentencing Incentive Grants Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 13701-712, and that its unauthorized use of the programs denied him due process insofar as it served as an across the board basis for parole denial for violent offenders until they have served at least 85 percent of their prison terms. The court sustained respondents' demurrer. The court held that the commonwealth had an indefinite sentencing plan and could seek qualification for the grants. The court found that because respondents' policy was grounded upon a valid statutorily based reason, it was constitutional for due process purposes. The court held that the policy was not cruel and unusual punishment because there was no right to parole.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant township proposed to extent sewer services to the property of appellee property owners and filed a declaration of taking. On its easement, appellant raised the level of the ground rendering appellee's basement inaccessible, preventing storage, and eliminating their dog kennel. In a hearing more than eight years later, the trial court awarded delay damages and interest. The court held that the trial court properly tolled the delay damages for a 12-month delay caused by the death of appellee's expert witness. The court held that the trial court erred in computing interest based on the prime rate rather than the commercial loan rate during the delay period. The court found that the trial court's award of attorney's fees was proper because a frivolous motion and an improper discover request by appellant were obdurate, dilatory, and vexatious in nature. The court held that appellant failed to show that it was prejudiced by the admission of testimony concerning settlement negotiations or by the admission of audiotapes of the board of view. Therefore, the court remanded for proper determination of interest and otherwise affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant agency sought review of an order from the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County (Pennsylvania) that denied appellant's preliminary objections to respondent individual's petition for appointment of a board of viewers pursuant to Eminent Domain Code &sect; 502, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &sect; 1-502.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On July 22, 1993, appellant agency issued a letter to respondent individual, giving official notice of appellant's intention to enter land in which respondent held a leasehold interest for the purpose of accomplishing a stream channel restoration project at an abandoned mine site. Respondent then filed a petition for appointment of board of viewers pursuant to Eminent Domain Code &sect; 502, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &sect; 1-502. Appellant filed preliminary objections in response. Subsequently, the trial court held respondent sufficiently pleaded a de facto taking. The trial court also determined, while respondent provided sufficient facts establishing a right to relief, it was premature to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Appellant then sought review. On review, the court reversed and remanded with instructions for transfer to the environmental hearing board, because appellant's preliminary objections made out a claim on their face that appellant acted, not under its eminent domain powers, but under its police powers, and thus, jurisdiction lay with the environmental hearing board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After respondent Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole (Board) denied petitioner's application for parole, he contended that the denial violated his due process and equal protection rights, and that the addition of &sect; 34.1, 61 P.S. &sect; 331.34a(b) (1995), to the Parole Act violated the constitutional prohibition against passage of an ex post facto law. The court sustained the demurrer filed by respondents, Governor, Board, and Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. The court held that there was no due process violation because participation in a community corrections center was not a protected liberty interest. The court also held that there was no ex post facto law violation because there was no constitutional guarantee against change in the law relating to parole. The court concluded that petitioner's contentions that respondent board denied him a fair parole hearing by retroactively applying &sect; 34.1(a)(3) were without merit. Finally, the court held that there was no equal protection violation because the classification and disparate treatment between violent and nonviolent offenders did not offend the concept of due process or equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner prisoner sought review of a decision of respondent Unemployment Compensation Board of Review which held that he was ineligible for unemployment benefits under 43 Pa.

The court stated that because prisoners were not a suspect class there only needed to be a rational reason for the classification to be constitutionally valid. The court held that the General Assembly had a legitimate and rational reason not to want prisoners to receive unemployment benefits because either the prisoners were not sufficiently available for work even though eligible for work release or the denial of benefits was a deterrence of criminal activity. Accordingly, because the statute denying unemployment compensation benefits to incarcerated prisoners was constitutionally valid the court affirmed the decision denying petitioner's benefits.</SPAN></P>

Respondent granted an energy company's application for the issuance of a qualified rate order to recover stranded-costs pursuant to the Electricity Generation Customer Choice and Competition Act (the Act), 66 Pa.

Petitioner objected to respondent's approval of the application and asserted that the provisions of the Act allowing the recovery of stranded-costs violated the commerce clause of the federal constitution. On review, the court examined the Act referencing the applicable constitutional clauses and principles. The court held that the state's interest in regulating the retail sales of electric utilities, was enough to uphold the stranded-cost provisions under the commerce clause. Further, the court found that the Act did not involve the commerce clause because it promoted competition on equitable terms and the stranded-cost provisions were consistent with traditional state regulation of local electric rates.

Concerning respondent's constitutional argument that 25 P.S. &sect; 2872.1(3) violated the &quot;one man-one vote principle&quot; by diluting the signatures of electors in the more populous areas, the court first determined what standard of review it should apply. The court held that the one man-one vote principle was not involved, and, therefore, neither was a fundamental right. Applying the rational basis standard, which was more applicable given the greater deference and leeway extended to state elections as compared with the scrutiny of federal election cases, the court held that the state had several legitimate interests in the signature requirements of &sect; 2872.1(3). The court held that respondent had failed to demonstrate that &sect; 2872.1(3) was not rationally related to the furtherance of the state's interests. Therefore, the statute was constitutional. The court denied respondent's motion to dismiss. Respondent had stipulated that he did not obtain the signatures required by the statute, so the court set aside his nomination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant sought review of an order of the Common Pleas Court of the County of Allegheny (Pennsylvania) that granted appellee port authority and employees' motion for summary judgment and dismissed appellant's complaint with prejudice, in appellant's action against appellees, alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress, misuse and abuse of process, assault and battery, false arrest, false imprisonment, libel, and slander.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant was mistreated by appellee port authority and employees after he argued with a trolley operator. He instituted an action against appellees alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress and other offenses. Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. Appellant sought review and the court reversed the order. Appellant argued that the trial court erred in granting appellees' motion because he alleged a course of conduct by appellees acting under color of law which, on its face, established that they had violated his civil rights. The court found that additional discovery would likely uncover material facts relevant to establishing whether the conduct would give rise to a cause of action against them under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Therefore, the trial court erred in granting appellees' motion. Appellant claimed that the trial court erred in granting appellees' motion on the basis that sovereign immunity shielded them from liability. An employee was not protected by the local agency's immunity if his act constituted a crime. Appellees, therefore, were not with respect to the count of intentional infliction of emotional distress.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The General Assembly enacted substantial amendments to the Public Transportation Law which affected petitioner citizens. Petitioners challenged the constitutionality of the procedures followed by the General Assembly in enacting the amendments and sought injunctive and declaratory relief against respondent state officials. Respondents filed preliminary objections asserting petitioners lacked standing, the matter was a non-justiciable, political question, and failure to state a cause of action upon which relief could be granted. On review, the court observed that the action was not barred due to any lack of standing or that the claim was non-justiciable. However, the court found that petitioners were unable to prove facts legally sufficient to establish that the act was enacted in violation of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 1. Specifically, the constitution was devoid of any procedural restrictions specifically relating to the enactment process for a transportation bill. Thus, the petition failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant road crew laborer alleged that her supervisor harassed her while she was pregnant and she filed a sexual discrimination suit against appellee township and supervisors. The matter ended up in state court where appellant filed a motion for a jury trial, which the trial court dismissed pursuant to the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (PHRA). Thereafter the trial court found in favor of appellees. Appellant sought review and asserted that the trial court erred by excluding certain evidence, that the trial judge exhibited a bias in favor of appellees to warrant reassigning the case to a different judge, and that the PHRA created the right to demand a jury trial. On review, the court noted that the legislature was free to provide the right to a jury trial under the PHRA. However, pursuant to the language of the statute and the legislative history, the court found that there was no statutory or constitutional right to a jury trial. Therefore, the order denying a jury trial was affirmed. However, the trial court erred in evidentiary matters.

Appellant salesperson was convicted of conspiracy and mail fraud for his role in a scheme to defraud auto insurance companies. The court held that respondent had jurisdiction to revoke appellants' licenses despite the fact that those licenses were suspended or had not been renewed because appellants still had property interests in the licenses. The court held that the license revocation was a civil penalty that did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause after appellant's conviction. The court held that the statute was not void for vagueness because respondent had promulgated regulations establishing the requirements for a license under the statute. Finally, the court held that there was no equal protection or due process violation for respondent's refusal to review the criminal backgrounds of every license holder in the state to determine if appellants were being treated unfairly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bank challenged an order from appellee Board of Finance and Revenue (Pennsylvania) that denied appellant's request for a refund of bank shares taxes paid for a single tax year. Appellant asserted that amendments to the Tax Reform Code, 72 P.S. &sect; 7701, violated the Uniformity Clause, Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, because appellant, who had issued more shares and increased in value, was disproportionately affected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed an order of appellee Board of Finance and Revenue that denied appellant bank's request for a refund of bank shares taxes it paid for tax year 1989. Following a U.S. Supreme Court decision that held that bank shares taxes computed on the basis of a bank's net assets had to deduct tax exempt U.S. obligations, in 1989 the legislature amended the Tax Reform Code, 72 P.S. &sect; 7701, to provide for a one-time tax rate of 10.77 percent to make up for lost revenues. The court rejected appellant's assertion that the amendments violated the Uniformity Clause, Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, because it required appellant to pay a disproportionate share of the refund as a result of the fact that appellant had issued new shares since the time of the refund. The court held that there was no valid distinction that required appellee to treat appellant differently because it issued more shares or its value had increased. The court found that when the one-time tax rate stood on its own and was uniformly applied to all banks, whether one bank received a larger or smaller credit proportionate to what it paid was irrelevant in determining unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellee board's order that refused appellant bank's request for a refund. The court held that the one-time tax rate did not violate the Uniformity Clause when it stood alone and was applied uniformly to all banks. The court stated that whether the tax rate caused a bank to receive a larger or smaller credit proportionate to what it paid was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a husband and wife, sought review of an order of respondent Board of Finance and Revenue (Pennsylvania), which affirmed a decision denying petitioners a refund based on their personal income tax return.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, husband and wife, argued that respondent Department of Finance and Revenue erred in construing 72 P.S. &sect; 7314(b), which provided petitioners a credit for &quot;income subject to tax&quot; by Delaware, because their entire gross income was used in the calculation of their Delaware tax liability and, thus, was &quot;income subject to tax.&quot; Consequently, petitioners asserted, they were entitled a credit for the entire tax paid to Delaware and not just a percentage of the tax. The court disagreed, noting that Delaware used a taxpayer's total income, both in-state and out-of-state, to establish a tax rate and then applied that rate solely to the Delaware income. The court concluded that although out-of-state income was used by Delaware to calculate the appropriate tax rate, the out-of-state income itself was not subject to tax for purposes of &sect; 7314(b). This provision was used by respondent to calculate the credit to which petitioners were entitled for income that was actually taxed by Delaware, rather than merely &quot;considered&quot; by Delaware in arriving at a tax rate. To rule otherwise could eliminate any tax liability in Pennsylvania, even though income was earned there.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision denying petitioners, husband and wife, a refund based on their Pennsylvania personal income tax return was affirmed, because out-of-state income used by Delaware to set the tax rate on petitioners' Delaware earnings was not &quot;income subject to tax&quot; under Pennsylvania law that entitled petitioners to a Pennsylvania credit on all Delaware taxes paid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a property owner and a corporation licensed to operate group homes for youths, sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas, Northampton County (Pennsylvania), which affirmed a decision of appellee township zoning hearing board denying appellants' request for permission to operate a group home for dependent female youths.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a property owner and a licensed operator of group homes, argued that appellee township improperly denied their application to operate a group home for dependent girls. The court disagreed, ruling that the proposed use did not satisfy the requirements for a group home as established by an ordinance. Because this use did not involve any &quot;handicapped&quot; children, the proposed facility could not be considered a group home permitted by right, nor could the proposed use be permitted by a special exception as a use of the same character as a group home. The proposed living arrangement was simply not a use of the same character as a single family dwelling because the arrangement was of a transient nature and removed from the concept of a single family dwelling. Moreover, the maximum number of unrelated residents exceeded the number permitted by ordinance. Appellants were not entitled to a variance, because they failed to show that the property could not be used for purposes permitted by the ordinance. Finally, ordinance limitations on the number of unrelated persons living in a dwelling unit were constitutional, bearing a rational relationship to permissible social objectives.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance limitation as to unrelated persons in a dwelling was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that her dismissal from city employment pursuant to Philadelphia Home Rule Charter &sect; 8-301 for holding dual government employment was improper because her second job, with the postal service (USPS), was not government employment within the meaning of &sect; 8-301. The court disagreed, rejecting the contention that because USPS was an independent organization under the executive branch of government and independent of congressional control, employment with USPS was akin to working for a private employer. USPS was an &quot;agency&quot; of the federal government under the legal definition of the term, the court said, noting that the term encompassed independent federal organizations, Moreover, the Postal Reorganization Act (Act), 39 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 101-5605, in removing USPS from the political sphere, preserved for congress authority over USPS operations. As to appellant's argument that &sect; 8-301 infringed her right to equal protection, in that no conflict of interest was involved, the court ruled that there was a basis for only allowing certain exceptions, as when special expertise was required, and that &sect; 8-301 survived a rational basis review under a presumption of constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner was billed $ 12,230 for an emergency surcharge assessed by the Medical Professional Catastrophic Loss Fund (CAT fund).

A hearing officer recommended that petitioner's medical license be suspended for 12 days. The State Board of Medicine modified the suspension to six days.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee filed a complaint against appellant for unpaid sewer and refuse charges and for related late fees and penalties. Appellant filed a cross-complaint alleging that the late fees and penalties were usurious and unconstitutional. The trial court entered two separate judgments: one in favor of appellee on its complaint and the other in favor of appellee on appellant's cross-complaint. Appellant requested a single review of both issues. After reviewing Pa. R. Civ. P. D. J. 1004, the trial court concluded that appellant did not properly request a review. The court affirmed the denial of review because Rule 1004 required appellant to file two separate notices of review if he wished both adverse judgments entered against him to be reviewed. The court found that the rule clearly treated judgments entered on two cross-complaints as separate judgments. The court found that Pa. R. Civ. P. D. J. 315(C) did not require the trial court to enter a single judgment when there was a complaint and a cross-complaint. Furthermore, the court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying review under Pa. R. Civ. P. 216, which allowed trial court to overlook procedural errors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent state department of revenue (Pennsylvania) challenged by preliminary objections the petition for review brought by petitioner surviving spouse in original jurisdiction. Petitioner sought to have the court declare unconstitutional the tax rate under the Inheritance and Estate Tax Act, 72 P.S. &sect;&sect; 9101 - 9196, for transfers of property to surviving spouses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner surviving spouse paid an inheritance tax of six percent on settlements received in survival and wrongful death actions against various manufacturers of asbestos products. If her spouse had died in a later year, she would have paid no tax. Petitioner contended it was unconstitutional that the tax rate for transfers from decedents varied according to the year in which they died, under a phase-out of the tax on transfers to surviving spouses, under 72 P.S. &sect; 9116(a)(1.1)(i), (ii). Respondent state department of revenue filed preliminary objections. The court held that petitioner had not exhausted adequate administrative remedies before she proceeded with constitutional claims. In essence, petitioner's action sought a refund for taxes paid and sought to avoid being taxed in the future. Under the Inheritance and Estate Tax Act, 72 P.S. &sect;&sect; 9181, 9186, petitioner could seek a refund, pursue further judicial review if unsuccessful, protest an assessment, and appeal an agency determination. Petitioner showed no reason that she should have been excused from following statutory administrative procedure. The constitutional question alone did not confer equity jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners individuals filed a complaint that alleged that the procedural process used to enact the Low Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Act, 35 P.S. &sect;&sect;7130.101 - 7130.905, violated Pa. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect;1, 2, 4. Respondents Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and its governor and treasurer filed a summary judgment motion and alleged that the matter was barred by laches. The court held that because petitioners' challenge to the legislation was on procedural grounds after its passage, the laches doctrine if proven was applicable to the constitutional challenge. Petitioners argued that laches was not a proper subject for a summary judgment motion because the doctrine was factual in nature, but the court held that it was proper on the face of the pleadings where petitioners failed to file a timely response to respondents' summary judgment motion pursuant to Pa. R. Civ. P. 1035.5. Thus, the court granted respondents' motion because petitioners did not act with due diligence in filing the complaint eight years after the statute's enactment and because the delay caused respondents to suffer prejudice that included substantial costs implementing the legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimant was a deckhand on a tour boat that plied the navigable waters of the Delaware River. Petitioner asserted that he was injured while he was performing one of his duties as an employee, which was making a trash run to an offshore dumpster. Respondent Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction under the Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Act (PWCA), 77 P.S. &sect;1 et seq., because petitioner failed to prove that his duties were sufficiently land based. Petitioner asserted that because his injury occurred within the territorial borders of Pennsylvania he was entitled to benefits under the PWCA. The court held that because petitioner was a seaman and his injury occurred in the course of his employment his state claim was pre-empted by federal law, in particular under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C.S. &sect;688 et seq. The Jones Act had a very liberal definition of a seaman, which included petitioner's status as one who had a more or less permanent connection to a vessel. Also, since petitioner was working pursuant to his employer's orders he was acting within the course of his employment, even though the injury occurred on land.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of respondent Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board that dismissed petitioner claimant's state cause of action for workmen's compensation benefits, because respondent properly determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction in the matter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner correctional officers sought review of an order of respondent Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board which dismissed petitioner's action. Petitioners also filed an original action against respondents, the City of Philadelphia and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, challenging the constitutionality of an ordinance of respondent city and 43 P.S. &sect;1101.2003, in an action involving petitioners' choice of a bargaining representative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner correctional officers formed an organization after experiencing dissatisfaction with the collective bargaining unit assigned to them under Philadelphia, Pa., Ordinance of April 4, 1961 (1961 Ordinance). Respondent Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board (PLRB) dismissed petitioners' action requesting that respondent City of Philadelphia be required to recognize their chosen bargaining unit. Petitioners contended that respondent city's refusal to recognize their chosen bargaining unit infringed on their rights of association and equal protection. The court affirmed the order of respondent PLRB and the order of summary relief in favor of respondents, dismissed petitioners' complaint, and denied their cross-motion for summary relief. The 1961 Ordinance, saved by 43 P.S. &sect;1101.2003, acted as an absolute bar on petitioners' rights to choose a labor organization for the purposes of collective bargaining. U.S. Const. amend I and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 allowed workers to voice their views, but did not require employers to engage in collective bargaining. Moreover, respondent city safeguarded its legitimate interest in ensuring it would not be overburdened with labor matters.</SPAN></P>

The court denied petitioners' summary judgment motion and dismissed respondents' summary judgment motion as moot. The court found petitioners failed to establish entitlement to the requested relief when the act which restricted adult entertainment establishments was not an impermissible content based free speech restriction where it was aimed at ameliorating secondary effects of adult entertainment, as opposed to the suppression of free speech itself. The court noted, as a result, that the regulation was considered content neutral, and the standard to be applied was analyzing whether the regulation was narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest while leaving open ample alternative channels of communication. The court further explained governmental attempts to reduce adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment was recognized as furthering the substantial interest in protecting citizen heath and welfare.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature passed an act amending the Public Official Compensation Law, 65 P.S. &sect;&sect; 366.1-366.5b, which provided for a cost of living adjustment (COLA) salary increase and unvouchered expense allowance increase for legislators. Petitioner citizen contended the act violated Pa. Const. art.

Respondent public officials filed preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer. The court sustained respondents' preliminary objection and dismissed petitioner's complaint. The expense allowance was an amount paid to cover expenses incurred in the performance of the legislators' services; thus, even though the allowance increased under a COLA formula, it was not a salary subject to Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 8. Petitioner did not allege the allowance was unneeded. The act that effected the pay increase contained a provision that it was to take effect immediately and &quot;be applicable as constitutionally permissible.&quot; Thus, the act was by its own terms not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained respondent public officials' preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer because petitioner citizen had failed to state a cause of action.

The order is affirmed with respect to Holsten's conviction for violating &sect; 49-7 of the ordinance on March 20, 1996 (Citation No. A126505); the order is reversed with respect to Holsten's conviction for violating &sect; 49-12(A) on January 30, 1996 (Citation No. A126492); and the order is reversed with respect to her conviction for violating &sect; 49-7 on September 28, 1995 (Citation A126478).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pet owner challenged her conviction by the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (Pennsylvania) for letting her dogs and rabbit run at large under Haverford Township, Pa., Ord. 1806, art. I., &sect;&sect; 49-7 and 49-12, respectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pet owner was convicted of letting her dogs run at large on two different occasions under Haverford Township, Pa., Ord. 1806, art. I, &sect; 49-7, and of allowing her rabbit to trespass on her neighbor's property under &sect; 49-12. Appellant sought review. The trial court noted that it had erred in convicting appellant of the violation of &sect; 49-12 because the rabbit had not committed any damage, as required under the ordinance. Consequently, the court reversed that conviction. The court also reversed appellant's first conviction for allowing her dogs to run at large because it had not been shown that, on that day, the dogs had ever left appellant's property or posed any threat to the public. To avoid having to find &sect; 49-7 unconstitutional, the court interpreted it to require one of those two elements, although it did not interpret the ordinance to require any criminal intent or guilty knowledge. The second violation of &sect; 49-7 was affirmed, where the dogs were found at a different address. Finally, the court remanded for any necessary modification of the fines imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed appellant pet owner's first conviction for allowing her dogs to run at large because the dogs had not left appellant's property. The court affirmed the second conviction because the dogs were found elsewhere. The court also reversed the conviction for allowing the rabbit to escape, finding that it had not damaged any property. Finally, the court remanded for a modification, if any, of the fines and court costs assessed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner death row inmate appealed from a determination of respondent Department of Corrections (Pennsylvania), denying him access to certain information relative to its use of lethal injections for carrying out death sentences on the ground that the information was not subject to disclosure under 65 P.S. &sect;&sect; 66.2 and 66.3, provisions of the state Right-to-Know Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner death row inmate requested information as to the use of lethal injections to carrying out death sentences from respondent, Department of Corrections, claiming to be entitled to the information under the state's Right-to-Know Act.

After rejecting a challenge to petitioner's standing to appeal, the court found that some of the requested materials were &quot;public records&quot; within the meaning of 65 P.S. &sect; 66.1(2). The court held that petitioner was entitled to materials generally concerning the injection procedure, as well as information concerning the identity and recorded observations of execution witnesses. However, the court upheld respondent's refusal to produce records pertaining to actual methods of injection and related security measures because a risk to the public might result. The court also found that while photographs of prior executions were outside the ambit of the statute, and thus were not subject to disclosure, certain medical reports such as post-mortem reports were subject to disclosure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner school administrators filed a five-count petition for review.

Count III of the petition alleged that because the statute failed to comply with procedures for obtaining approval of the state budget, respondent governor violated his constitutional duties to faithfully execute the laws and to return any bill of that he did not approve when he signed the statute. Respondent union and state officials objected. The court held that because none of the state respondents was an indispensable party to Counts I, II, IV or V of the petition, the court lacked original jurisdiction over those counts under 42 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff attorneys, taxpayers, and electors brought a complaint in quo warranto to enjoin the commonwealth from placing on the ballot a proposed constitutional amendment regarding an accused's right to confront witnesses and enactment of laws on procedures governing the testimony of children in criminal proceedings. In their cross motions for summary judgment after a majority of the electorate voted in favor of the ballot question, the parties disputed plaintiffs' standing to challenge the constitutionality of the amendment. The court noted that plaintiffs were sworn to defend the constitution and that they and their clients were directly impacted by the amendment. Since plaintiffs' interest in the matter was substantial, direct, and immediate, the court concluded that they had standing. The court also declared the ballot question null and void because it proposed two amendments to the constitution with a single question. Accordingly, plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment was granted and defendant's motion for summary judgment was denied.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs were sworn to defend the constitution and their clients would be impacted by the amendment, so their standing was therefore established by the substantial, direct, and immediate interest they had in the matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, publisher and consumer, filed an action against respondents, Pennsylvania Department of Revenue and its Director, that challenged the federal and state constitutionality of the state statute that exempted from state sales tax Bibles and other religious materials. On stipulated facts the parties moved for summary judgment and the court granted petitioners' motion. The court found that the tax exemption violated both U.S. Const. amend. I, and Pa. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3. The court noted that the United States Supreme Court had already issued decisions to the same effect. The court distinguished the exemption from the real estate tax exemption enjoyed by religious organizations. The court noted that the real estate exemption had existed since the nation's founding and that the same exemption applied to hospitals and other charitable organizations. The court held that while imposing real estate taxes on religious organizations would likely increase an entanglement between the secular government and religion, for example because of potential foreclosures, the imposition of the sales tax on religious publications would not interfere with anyone's practice of religion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners owned a residential dwelling in an R-2 residential district. A detached two-car garage was located on the property. Respondent borough served an enforcement notice upon appellants to stop all auto repair maintenance work in the garage. Appellants filed an appeal, respondent zoning board denied appellants' claim, and the trial court affirmed. On review, appellants argued that the ordinance discriminated between carport and private parking lot owners and those who owned private garages. However, the court found that appellants failed to provide evidence that they were treated differently than other residents in the R-2 district. Furthermore, the court found that a garage in which major vehicle repairs were performed could produce noise, fumes, and dirt which would disturb the residential character of the area. Prevention of such interferences was a legitimate governmental interest and was not achieved in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner. The court also rejected appellants' argument that the phrase &quot;repair of motor vehicles&quot; was vague because residents could understand that simple auto repairs would be acceptable. The trial court's decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner notary public's application to be recommissioned as a notary public was denied by respondent state agency on the ground that petitioner was convicted of income tax evasion and thus failed to establish that he was of good moral character. A hearing was held wherein petitioner's application was formally rejected. On appeal, petitioner argued that the requirement for a notary to be of good moral character was constitutionally vague, thereby violating his right to due process. However, the court found that procedural due process required that petitioner be given adequate information with which to prepare a defense. Furthermore, petitioner was fully informed of the charges against him and the statutory section involved. Therefore, petitioner received the minimum protection required under due process of law. Finally, petitioner's argument that it was cruel and unusual punishment for respondent to revoke his notary commission for an unspecified period was without merit because respondent was not required to provide petitioner with a date certain. Accordingly, respondent's order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners requested that respondents be enjoined from performing the provisions of the Act. The court concluded that petitioner had standing to raise their constitutional claims. However, the court concluded that judicial scrutiny of petitioners' constitutional claims was barred by the Enrolled Bill Doctrine, which provided that when a law had been passed and approved and certified in due form, it was no part of the duty of the judiciary to go behind the law as duly certified to inquire into the observance of form in its passage.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners and intervenors, a labor union, state legislators, and two groups representing injured workers, filed petitions for review in the nature of complaints in equity addressed to the court's original jurisdiction. Petitioners sought to permanently enjoin respondents, a state government and its officials, from implementing the provisions of a state statute modifying the workers' compensation procedure. Petitioners requested a declaratory judgment that the statute was unconstitutionally or unlawfully enacted. Respondents and another group of intervenor state legislators, who supported respondents, filed preliminary objections to the petition for review, contending that judicial inquiry into the claims of petitioners and supporting intervenors was barred by the Enrolled Bill Doctrine, the Political Question Doctrine, and the Speech and Debate Clause of the state constitution. While finding that the claims of petitioners and intervenors were not barred, the court analyzed the procedure used in the passage of the statute and determined that it complied with the constitutional mandates of Pa.

Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 5101 - 5956. Petitioners appealed and the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. Thc court found that respondent's findings of fact were supported by the evidence. The court held that the payments were not bonuses, but incentive payments included as compensation under 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5102 because they were intended as compensation, represented a substantial percentage of the participants' total salaries, had been paid regularly over a period of years, and had specific standards for payment. The court found that annual leave was excluded from compensation under &sect; 5102. One petitioner's conditional retirement application should have been accepted because the accommodation offered was illusory.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings and on his application for a writ of mandamus, both of which the court denied. Petitioner failed to demonstrate that he was entitled to judgment on the pleadings, or that he had a clear right to relief. The court found that it did not need to reach the constitutionality of how petitioner's benefits were calculated as petitioner failed to establish that his recalculated benefits would have been retroactively applied.

The court did not address appellant's argument. However, the court reversed the order dismissing the appeal.

The order of the Insurance Commissioner of Pennsylvania at No. MS95-10-056, dated February 7, 1996, is vacated. 2. The matter is remanded to the Insurance Department with the specific directions to conduct a hearing in compliance with the Administrative Agency Law, 2 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, policyholders and reinsurers, sought review of a decision of respondent Pennsylvania Insurance Department, which approved a plan of restructure and division filed by an insurer under the amendments to the General Association Act of 1988, 15 P.S. &sect;&sect; 20101-20304.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An insurer proposed to divide and restructure in accordance with the General Association Act of 1988, 15 P.S. &sect;&sect; 20101-20304, because of potential asbestos and environmental liabilities. Respondent Pennsylvania Insurance Department published notice of the plan, invited comments, and held informal hearings, but did not permit cross-examination or release expert reports. Respondent's commissioner approved the plan. Petitioners, policyholders and reinsurers, sought review. The court vacated and remanded. The court concluded that the General Assembly intended to interpose the formal procedures of the Administrative Agency Law (AAL), 2 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 101 et seq., between the determination after the informational hearing and judicial review, because the provision of 15 P.S. &sect; 21207(d) for judicial review &quot;in a manner prescribed by law&quot; necessarily made the AAL applicable. The court found that because the commissioner could be considered to have prejudged the matter, due process precluded her from conducting the hearing and making a decision during the AAL phase of the proceedings. The court stated that petitioner policyholders had standing, but petitioner reinsurers did not.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order of respondent Pennsylvania Insurance Department approving an insurer's restructuring, because respondent had failed to conduct the formal procedure required by statute.

Both the department and the board filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer, which the court sustained. Petitioner's mandamus petition failed to allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action against the board. The facts as alleged by petitioner, that his temporary home furlough was approved and then arbitrarily revoked, did not alter the fact that petitioner had no constitutional right to participate in a pre-release program.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After performing alternate civilian work as a conscientious objector, petitioner school employee received a certificate advising that he had completed the work in lieu of induction into the armed forces.

Respondent, Pennsylvania Public School Employees' Retirement Board, denied his request, and petitioner sought review. The court affirmed respondent's order. The court stated that the record supported the conclusion that petitioner's service was not military service as that term was defined and utilized in 24 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 8102, 8304, and that because the statutory language was clear, its letter was not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit. The court stated that because such credit for military service was a benefit the commonwealth need not have offered, the legislature's restriction of the benefit to active military service was clearly not irrational and so did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court similarly found no violation of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 3, 17, 26, or Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner's placement of a constitutional patina on his challenge did not give the court jurisdiction to hear his appeal because at the core of any such appeal were the principles that a prisoner had a right to parole and could have challenged respondent parole board's exercise of its discretion. The court stated that mandamus did not lie because there was no constitutional prohibition against using petitioner's refusal to admit guilt as a basis for denying participation in the treatment program and a failure to complete that program successfully was a valid reason for denying parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed respondent parole board from petitioner inmate's action against respondents, parole board and department of corrections, for mandamus or other relief to review the failure to grant petitioner parole. The court found that there was no constitutionally protected liberty interest in receiving parole and the court therefore lacked jurisdiction to review, by mandamus or otherwise, respondent parole board's discretionary acts.</SPAN></P>

Following a hearing granting petitioner's request to purchase credit for the three years of graduate study, respondent Pennsylvania State Employees' Retirement Board reversed the hearing examiner's decision, denying petitioner's request. Respondent concluded that the legislature did not intend to give 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5302(b)(1) retroactive effect. Section 5302(b)(1), relating to credited state service, provided that a member on leave without pay who was studying under a federal grant approved by the head of his department was be eligible for credit for such service. Under 4 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, adult-bookstore operators, filed a petition seeking a declaration that 68 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 5501-5509, (the act) was unconstitutional. Petitioners filed a motion seeking a preliminary injunction against respondent state from enforcing the act. The court denied the motion, holding that petitioners failed to demonstrate a probability of success on the merits, and did not demonstrate irreparable harm. The court found that the requirement that materials be displayed in well-lighted areas, which were open and visible from a common area, restricted only the manner in which materials could have been viewed, was content neutral. The court held that the restrictions were narrowly tailored to achieve the legitimate goals of reducing illicit sexual activity and the spread of communicable diseases. The court held that the provision abating violations of the act as nuisances was not a prior restraint, and held that the act was not unconstitutional vague. Finally the court held that the requirement that such businesses were to open to inspection at all reasonable times by inspectors, did not authorize a warrantless search in violation of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Jefferson County (Pennsylvania), that summarily convicted him of violating of the Punxsutawney, Pa. Ordinance No. 982, on the ground that the council exceeded its powers by enacting an ordinance which he believed declared junked vehicles to be a nuisance per se and abused its discretion when it sentenced him to 90 days in jail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant operated a bus company that provided charter bus service and transportation of students. He owned property where, for more than 15 years he stored numerous motor vehicles and parts to use for the repair of his vehicles. The borough council adopted Punxsutawney, Pa. Ordinance No. 982, which regulated the number of junk vehicles that could be stored on property. The borough charged appellant with committing a violation of the ordinance and ordered him to pay a fine. The trial court found appellant guilty, ordered him to pay the cost of prosecution, a fine, and sentenced him to 90 days in jail. Appellant argued that the trial court erred in finding him guilty of the ordinance and abused its discretion in sentencing him to jail. Appellant argued that the council exceeded powers by enacting an ordinance which he believed declared junked vehicles to be a nuisance per se. The appellate court reversed and held that the evidence was insufficient to prove the junk vehicles on appellant's property constituted a nuisance in fact. The court ruled that sentencing under the Crimes Code, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1105, did not control the penal provisions of violations of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the trial court sentencing of appellant to 90 days in jail would have been erroneous, even if it had properly found him guilty of violating the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayers filed a petition for review in the form of a declaratory judgment action with the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania against respondent state, its attorney general, the Board of Commissioners of the county, the Board of Assessment Appeals of the county, and the county. Petitioners claimed that the County Personal Property Tax Law, 72 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 4821-4902 was unconstitutional and respondents challenged jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayers owned stock of corporations that did not do business Pennsylvania and contended that the County Personal Property Tax Law, 72 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 4821-4902 was unconstitutional in taxing such stock. Petitioners challenged such taxation by filing a petition for review in the form of a declaratory judgment with the court. Respondent state, its attorney general, Board of Commissioners of the county, Board of Assessment Appeals of the county, and the county objected to the court's original jurisdiction. The court sustained respondents' objection and held that respondent Board of Assessment Appeals was not a proper forum because it had no expertise in deciding whether a statute violated the United States Constitution. As such, the court found that the original jurisdiction did properly lie in a court of equity. However, the court held that it did not have original jurisdiction of the matter because respondent state and its attorney general were not indispensable parties to the suit. The court held that respondent county was the taxing authority and that the proper forum for the original adjudication of the matter was the court of common pleas sitting in equity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained respondent state, attorney general, the Board of Commissioner of the county, the Board of Assessment Appeals of the county, and the county to petitioner taxpayers' petition for review. The court transferred the case to the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County sitting in equity, with instructions to provide expedited consideration of petitioners' action because the court did not have original jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The trial court upheld the summary conviction and fined appellant. Appellant sought review, challenging the ordinance as unconstitutionality vague in its definitions of &quot;useful and ornamental&quot; and &quot;planted.&quot; The court affirmed, holding that the ordinance was enacted pursuant to the Borough Code, 53 P.S. &sect; 46202, empowering boroughs to prohibit accumulation of garbage and rubbish on private ground; and the ordinance did not infringe upon appellant's due process rights as its terms could be defined according to their common meaning, the ordinance set a definite height to which vegetation could grow, and provided for notice by appellee before an attempt to abate the nuisance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hunter, convicted in the Common Pleas Court of the County of Lycoming (Pennsylvania) of violating three sections of the Game and Wildlife Code and fined, challenged his conviction, alleging that the evidence should have been suppressed because it was obtained by unconstitutional means.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conservation officers investigated an anonymous tip that two untagged deer, had been killed illegally and were in a barn on the property where appellant hunter lived. On finding no one at the house, the officers looked around the property to locate someone who would know about the deer, and proceeded to the back of the house, climbing over a corral fence. They observed a barn and two hanging deer carcasses through the open barn door. The officers located appellant's stepson who stated that appellant had killed one deer, and informed the officers of appellant's location. The officers located appellant on the edge of a wooded area. Appellant admitted to the hunting, and signed a statement and consent form agreeing to allow the removal of the deer. Appellant was found guilty of violating three sections of the Game and Wildlife Code, 34 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 2307(a), 2321(a)(1), and 2711(a)(1). The court affirmed, holding that, while the initial search of the barn was unconstitutional and appellant's stepson's statement was inadmissible, appellant's statements and consent form, the after-acquired deer carcasses, and other evidence, were all properly admitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, holding that sufficient competent evidence supported conviction, and that appellant hunter's statements and consent form, the after-acquired deer carcasses, and other evidence, were all admissible, because the causal nexus between the original illegal search of the barn and the final search of the barn and removal of the deer was substantially attenuated by the independent voluntary actions on the part of appellant.</SPAN></P>

Appellants claimed that an ordinance enacted by township supervisors that established lower tap-in fees was applicable to them because it was in effect at the time they applied for their tap-in permits. Appellee argued and the trial court agreed that the ordinance was not valid and did not control tap-in fees because the supervisors did not have authority to set said fees. On appeal, the court affirmed the order of the trial court and held that under the Act, appellee had the exclusive power to regulate sewer rates and tap-in fees. As such appellee's resolution establishing the higher tap-in fees was applicable and found to be reasonable and uniform. The court also concluded that the trial court had not abused its discretion in denying appellants' motion to amend the complaint for the third time after the close of testimony to raise constitutional issues.</SPAN></P>

Respondent department of health determined that the Emergency Medical Services Act (the Act), 35 P.S. &sect; 6932(h) (1985), contained the correct criteria for the licensure of advanced life support (ALS) ambulance services and that the Act did not require, as a precondition to receiving a license, that the competing ambulance service demonstrate that the services were needed. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of respondent. The court found that the Act was unambiguous, and as such &sect; 6932(h) clearly set forth the correct standard for the licensure of ALS ambulance services. The court also found that nowhere in the Act did it require a prospective licensee to demonstrate, as a precondition to licensure, that there was a need for the ALS ambulance services.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimants sought review of an order of respondent state retirement board, which denied claimant's request for interest benefits withheld by the state retirement system pursuant to a purported pension forfeiture. Petitioners were all judges or represented the interest of judges who had been removed from office pursuant to Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 18(1) and were subject to Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 16(b) determined to be a pension forfeiture provision. The court held that because petitioner's retirement and pension benefits constituted both liquidated and enforceable debts, respondent's failure to pay those debts when they became due was characterized as a wrongful withholding of petitioner's benefits. The court held that neither the history nor the language of the Pennsylvania Constitution supported a conclusion that Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 16(b) was meant to create a broad pension forfeiture provision. Accordingly, the court found that petitioner's petition for interest presented a cognizable claim under the common law, which imposed a duty upon respondent to pay interest as damages for delay in discharging its debt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that petitioner claimants were entitled to an award of interest on retirement benefits due to petitioners from respondent state retirement board and, therefore, reversed respondent's order that denied petitioner's request for interest on retirement and remanded the case to respondent. The court held that petitioner's benefits were liquidated and enforceable debts and, therefore, payable by respondent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner political action groups sought review in the nature of a complaint in equity in the court's original jurisdiction, and alleged that the general assembly, in its enactment of the General Appropriation Act (GAA) violated Pa.

The court denied the request, holding that petitioners did not meet the criteria for a preliminary injunction. The court noted that some petitioners showed immediate and irreparable harm, but others refused to pay on principle, and self-inflicted harm did not qualify as irreparable. The court held that balancing petitioners' interest with the public interest, greater harm would result to malpractice victims if the relief was granted. The court held that the injunction could not restore the status quo, as not all petitioners held the same status. The court held that petitioners did not establish that the administrative remedies were inadequate, but that the more appropriate relief was administrative hearings for each petitioner to present its own case and for respondent boards to interpret the Health Care Services Malpractice Act, 40 Pa.

Petitioner police officer's challenged the adjustment and the retirement system resumed paying the unadjusted amounts, subject to adjustment at the conclusion of all appeals. The court, on appeal, affirmed appellee State Employees' Retirement Board's decision to adjust petitioner police officer's pension benefits and found that petitioner police officers belonged to a collective bargaining unit that was authorized to enter into binding arbitration on petitioner police officers' behalf, under Act 111, 43 P.S. &sect;&sect; 217.1-.10. The court found that the State Employees' Retirement Code, 71 Pa. Cons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court dismissing petitioners', police officers and union, objections to implementation of an arbitration award because the Retirement Code did not prohibit collective bargaining over pension benefits nor did it prohibit pension benefits from being affected by arbitration awards, but only prohibited collective bargaining agreements from determining pension rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant campsite owners were the owners and homeowners association for a tract of land used for camping and campsites. Appellee Zoning Hearing Board of Shohola Township, required appellants to put density limits in their deed restrictions, which appellants failed to enforce. Appellee subsequently passed a zoning ordinance in order to impose the density limits on the campsites, Shohola, Pa., Zoning Ordinance 44, &sect; 528. Appellants unsuccessfully challenged the validity of the zoning ordinance, and requested a variance from the ordinance. The court, on appeal, affirmed the trial court's finding that appellants had not established that they were entitled to a variance, and held that appellee was not engaged in spot zoning. The court found that appellants were not being singled out and treated differently from similar land, and that the density and setback requirements applied to motor homes and recreational vehicles. The court found that the ordinance did not deprive appellants of the use of their land as a camping area, that its intended use was temporary camping and not permanent residency, and that the density and setback requirements were valid zoning restrictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's decision which rejected appellant campsite owners' appeal for a zoning variance, because the zoning ordinance was created to enforce restrictive covenants on the properties, was related to density and setbacks, and appellants failed to show that appellee Zoning Hearing Board of Shohola Township engaged in illegal spot zoning or that they were entitled to a variance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee commercial parking operators within appellant school district successfully challenged a tax imposed on commercial parking lots that served an airport. The tax was for the general public use of funding education. The trial court held the tax was an invalid business privilege tax or mercantile tax on gross receipts in violation of the Reform Act, 72 P.S. &sect; 4750.533 (1988). On appeal, the court found the parking lot tax was neither a mercantile tax nor a business privilege tax which violated the Reform Act, but was a tax upon the transaction fees for parking in commercial parking lots. The measure of the tax is simply six percent of &quot;the fees paid.&quot; While appellees paid pay more taxes than others within the school district, it was the result of a reasonable classification of taxpayers and was not to benefit one group at the expense of another. The court held appellees failed to prove the parking lot tax was excessive or unreasonable or that the resolution is unlawful, under the Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. &sect; 6906 (1965).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant commonwealth challenged the order of the Fayette County Court of Common Pleas (Pennsylvania), granting appellee restaurant owner's motion in arrest of judgment. Appellant contended that an ordinance taxing gross receipts of vendors of good but not services, was reasonable and legitimate, and that the ordinance did not violate the equal protection clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, or the uniformity clause, Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee restaurant owner was prosecuted and found guilty of violating Uniontown, Pa., Ordinance 1124, &sect; 4, (1968), by failing to file gross receipt tax returns. The trial court subsequently arrested judgment, concluding that the ordinance was unconstitutional. Specifically, the trial court held that, because the ordinance taxed businesses selling goods, as well as restaurants and amusements, and not businesses providing services, it violated the equal protection clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, or the uniformity clause, Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. Appellant commonwealth sought review, and the court affirmed the trial court. The court held that appellee had met his heavy burden, and demonstrated that the classification, made for purposes of taxation, was unreasonable. Furthermore, the court found that, because there was no legitimate distinction between the classes of vendors, the ordinance unconstitutionally imposed substantially unequal tax burdens, and was therefore clearly, palpably, and plainly unconstitutional. Based on the record, the court noted that the goods providers and the service providers utilized city services to similar extents and were similarly situated.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was no legitimate distinction between vendors, and the ordinance unconstitutionally imposed substantially unequal tax burdens.</SPAN></P>

Without taking additional evidence, respondent adopted many of the findings of the hearing examiner as its own, made additional findings from the evidence of record, and revoked petitioner's medical license. Petitioner sought review. The court affirmed both adjudications and orders of respondent for suspension and revocation. The court held that testimony and medical charts provided substantial evidence of petitioner's prescribing habits, prosecutorial conduct, a criminal concept, was inapplicable in petitioner's civil case, laches had not attached, because the record showed no lack of due diligence or unjustified delay, and petitioner's due process rights were not violated by witness credibility not being considered at the preliminary hearing, because witness credibility was not an issue at that stage, and respondent was the ultimate fact finder.</SPAN></P>

Appellees filed for equitable relief in the trial court which denied appellees request, finding appellees' had neither an express or implied easement over appellants' property. Appellants filed a second suit requesting a board of view to determine the necessity of a private roadway, pursuant to the Private Road Act, 36 P.S. &sect; 2731, from appellees property through appellants property to the public drive. The board of view found a necessity and ordered the roadway to be opened. Appellants sought review of the decision and the trial court affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed appellant prisoner's action in mandamus and sustained the preliminary objections of appellee prison officials because it found that appellant's right to practice his Native American religion did not include the right to have the certain religious items. The court found that appellant failed to show that he had a clear right to relief and that the prison officials had a corresponding legal duty under law to provide relief. The court found that the prison officials utilized a balancing test to determine whether the appellant's requested religious articles were consistent with the orderly administration of the prison. The court determined that appellant had a right to practice his religion, but that Pa. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3 and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2000bb-2000bb-4 did not automatically require that prisoners be allowed the religious items they claimed were necessary to practice the religion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorney served as a city solicitor. Respondent state ethics commission investigated a complaint that petitioner violated the State Ethics Act. Petitioner sought declaratory judgment, claiming respondent did not have jurisdiction, and a permanent injunction to enjoin respondent's proceedings. Respondent filed preliminary objections and claimed declaratory judgment was unavailable to petitioner because its investigation was within the exclusive jurisdiction of a tribunal other than the court. The court held that declaratory judgment was not precluded on this basis because petitioner's claim raised the issue of respondent's jurisdiction and whether its exercise of authority was constitutional. Additionally, the court held that declaratory judgment was available because petitioner properly invoked the proceeding to determine whether, under existing law, he was subject to respondent's jurisdiction. Because there were factual disputes concerning whether petitioner was a public employee and whether a permanent injunction was necessary to avoid injury for which damages would not provide adequate compensation, the court overruled respondent's preliminary objections.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state filed a suit against appellees, municipality, water company, and superintendent, for violating the Clean Streams Act (the &quot;Act&quot;), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 35, &sect; 691.1 et seq., and the Fish and Boat Code, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 30, &sect; 101 et seq., and appellees filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to dismiss the complaint because the charges were brought under penalty provisions and not substantive provisions. The lower court agreed and granted appellees' writ of habeas corpus only with respect to the charges under the act. On appeal, the court reversed the order. The court held that appellant did charge appellees under a penalty provision of the act because the crime was clearly defined as proscribed conduct in another section of the act and referred to appellant's provision as the penalty provision. The court also held that the lower court erred in dismissing the charges because although there was a defect in appellant's complaint, appellees were informed of the conduct that appellant deemed actionable, and, as such, actual prejudice to appellees' rights did not occur to warrant dismissal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment in favor of dismissing appellant state's complaint against appellees, municipality, water company, and superintendent, was reversed on the grounds that appellant did erroneously charge appellees under statutory penalty provisions but the defect in appellant's complaint sufficed to inform appellees of the actionable conduct and, as such, did not prejudice appellees' rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee condemnor filed a Declaration of Taking of two parcels of property owned by appellant condemnees. The parties agreed to a settlement regarding the taking and signed a settlement agreement. Appellants filed a petition to open and set aside the satisfaction and discontinuance, believing that appellee failed to pay them delay damages under the Eminent Domain Code, 26 Pa. Stat. &sect; 611. The trial court, however, denied the petition, holding that the agreement represented the entire agreement of the parties and included all amounts payable. The court reversed, holding held that appellants had a legal right to delay damages calculated at the time of payment for the period during which payment was detained using the prevailing commercial interest rates. Because it was a legal right, appellants did not have to ask or bargain for the payment of delay compensation. The court found that the agreement, after providing for the payment of the determined value of appellants' real and personal property was a clear and unambiguous statement that appellants were asserting their right to delay damages under &sect; 611.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court and remanded this case for a hearing to determine the applicable rate of interest, the period of detention and amount of delay damages due to appellant condemnees on the unpaid balance of the determined value of the real and personal property taken by appellee condemnor.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners challenged the standing of the trades councils, claimed the project was not a public work, and claimed that the composition of respondent board was violative of petitioners' due process rights. The court affirmed the determination that the project was a public work. The Pennsylvania Prevailing Wage Act applied because of petitioner city's oversight and connection with the entire project.

The GAA was enacted as House Bill No. 1169, a specific appropriations bill, and was not originally a general appropriation bill.

Respondent accepted the auditors' changes, and petitioner appealed the resettlement of the taxes. The State Board of Finance and Revenue (board) agreed with respondent's decision, and petitioner appealed. The court affirmed the decision of the board because petitioner failed to meet its burden in proving that the taxing statute in question, 72 P.S. &sect; 7602(a), was unconstitutional. The court held that petitioner was afforded the choice under the &quot;compute and pay&quot; method as to how to compute its tax under &sect; 602(b)(1), and having elected to compute its tax under the three-factor apportionment method, it was treated as if it were a foreign entity subject to the franchise tax under &sect; 602(b)(1).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers sought review of a judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Schuylkill County (Pennsylvania), which sustained the preliminary objections of appellees, county, townships, and school districts, finding that appellants failed to raise a substantial constitutional question in appellants' equity action for a tax refund and a reassessment of their surface and coal reserve properties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In appellant taxpayers' equity action for a tax refund and a reassessment of their surface and coal reserve properties based on the constitutionality of The Fourth and Eighth Class County Assessment Law, 72 P.S. &sect;&sect; 5453.101-5453.706, and The General County Assessment Law, 72 P.S. &sect;&sect; 5020-1-5020-602, the trial court sustained the preliminary objections of appellees, county, townships, and school districts, finding that appellants failed to raise a substantial constitutional question. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not have equity jurisdiction, because appellant taxpayers did not show the existence of a substantial question of constitutionality and the absence of an adequate statutorily prescribed remedy. Appellants did not aver that their properties were treated differently than other similar lands under either assessment law. Thus, their assertions were merely allegations of unconstitutionality and did not confer equity jurisdiction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner funeral director appealed the order of the State Board of Funeral Directors (Pennsylvania), which revoked his funeral director's license subsequent to his having pled guilty to theft and conspiracy in the misappropriation of funds from an decedent's estate to which he had been named executor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner funeral director misappropriated funds from the estate of a deceased. Petitioner pled guilty to theft and conspiracy charges. Subsequently, respondent State Board of Funeral Directors revoked petitioner's funeral director's license. Petitioner appealed the revocation based on a double jeopardy argument. The court affirmed the order of respondent. The court found that respondent's decision to revoke the license was based on respondent's duty to protect the public, and not a determination to deter or punish. The court found that petitioner held a position of trust in the community because he was a funeral director. The court reasoned that whether double jeopardy applied to administrative proceedings was based on the penalty imposed and the purposes it served. The court agreed that the revocation of the license was not unduly harsh because petitioner had been trusted with the deceased's estate and he breached that trust.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of respondent State Board of Funeral Directors that revoked petitioner funeral director's license. The court found that petitioner was not subjected to double jeopardy by the agency's revocation because the penalty was designed to protect the public from unscrupulous funeral directors. The punishment was not unduly harsh because petitioner had occupied a position of trust.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the ordinance was not unconstitutional and entered judgment in favor of respondent and against appellees. The court affirmed the trial court judgment because there was nothing in the record or in the ordinance which suggested that the tax was directed at suppressing any particular ideas or that it was likely to stifle the free exchange of opinions. Moreover, because that tax was imposed upon all off-premises signs, it did not single out one small group of off-premises signs while exempting others from taxation. Further, appellants argued that the ordinance unconstitutionally imposed a content-based tax. The court disagreed because the ordinance imposed the tax on all off-premises signs regardless of their content, so the ordinance was content neutral. Further, the court found that the ordinance did not disadvantage non-commercial speech or violate appellants' rights to due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A former employee of petitioners, employer and shareholders, claimed that he was owed money by petitioners. After the employee filed a complaint in equity against petitioners, he requested that respondent, the Department of Labor, require petitioners to post bond as provided under &sect; 9.1(d) of the Wage Payment and Collection Law (WPCL), 43 P.S. &sect; 260.9a(d), to assure that payment of amounts owed could be made. Without a hearing, respondent directed petitioners to post a bond, and petitioners appealed that the notice violated their right to due process, was an abuse of discretion, and a misinterpretation of the WPCL. The court affirmed. The court held that petitioner's claim of a due process violation was premature because respondent had not levied execution on any property. Moreover, a reviewing court should not decide a constitutional question if the case can be decided on non-constitutional grounds. The court held that the WPCL was not unconstitutional because there were no standards to guide respondent's discretion. Respondent's reasoning in requiring petitioners to post a bond was not abuse of discretion. Therefore the court was required to affirm respondent's decision.</SPAN></P>

The court vacated the order because the witnesses privacy rights had to yield petitioner's right of confrontation. Petitioner's review of the disclosed portions of the records might have revealed information relevant in impeaching the witnesses. Therefore, the court remanded the matter to the commission in order for petitioner to review the portions of the mental health records that were disclosed to Department of Public Welfare.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 1401(c), 1411(2), by the workmen's compensation appeal board (the board), which affirmed the decision of the referee that petitioner had not met the manifestations provisions of &sect; 301(c)(2) by failing to file his claim within the 300 week period after the last date of employment. Petitioner argued that the time limits of the Act violated the equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Pa. Const. art.

It was not until after petitioner's retirement that PSERS discovered the error and reduced the monthly annuity benefits. Petitioner appealed the order of respondent, the Public School Employees' Retirement Board, which denied his appeal requesting that the annuity be calculated using 30 years and which ordered PSERS to collect the overpaid amounts. The court affirmed the decision. PSERS had to comply with the Public School Employees' Retirement Code, which required correction of errors. Petitioner should have known that he had not put in 30 years of service because of his sick leave.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant public advocates challenged the order of the Common Pleas Court of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) which found in favor of respondent city and water department in refusing to set aside the water rates pursuant to Philadelphia, Pa., Ordinance &sect; 1263 (1974) and the Bond Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 15901-924, for the fiscal years of 1993-1996.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant public advocates filed a complaint in equity against respondent city and water department, seeking to enjoin implementation of the water rate. Appellants contended that the rate transferred excess interest earnings, which was an illegal payment in lieu of taxes that made the rate unjust and unreasonable. The lower court held that appellants waived their right to raise the illegal tax issue for failing to raise it at the rate hearings, but that the claim had merit because a clear nexus between customer payments and transferred funds was established. Appellants challenged this ruling, claiming that respondent's funds transfer pursuant to Philadelphia, Pa., Ordinance &sect; 1263 (1974) and the Bond Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 15901-15924, was an illegal tax because customers received no service for the payment to the general fund from the excess interest of the sinking fund. The court affirmed the lower court's order, concluding that customers had no property interest in excess interest earnings, which were derived from the proceeds of bond sales, and that waiver could not be determined because appellants' complaint was not in the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment because the transfer of excess interest earnings to respondent city's general fund was not an unlawful tax. The application of revenues derived from the operation of respondent water department's utility to service bond debt conferred no property right on appellant public advocates to the excess interest earnings on the bond proceeds.</SPAN></P>

The court held that its scope of review was to examine whether the law was properly applied. Under Pa. Stat.

The board then granted a conditional use permit for the water pumping station. Appellants challenged the ordinance, alleging that it was special legislation, and the trial court denied their claim. The court affirmed, holding that special legislation cases dealt with ordinances that were changed to prohibit a property owner from a previously acceptable use. The court declined to extend the law to apply to actions where the government enabled an owner to do more with its property. The court also held that the law was not unjustly discriminatory or arbitrary, the mindset of the board in creating the law was irrelevant, and the ordinance was related to the general welfare and common good.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the hearing examiner issued a proposed adjudication order that dismissed all charges against petitioner nurse for allegedly permitting a nurse's aide to self-administer a controlled drug and not preventing the aide from abusing a patient in the nursing home where both were employed, respondent, State Board of Nursing, reversed the hearing examiner. Respondent formally reprimanded petitioner for unprofessional conduct and assessed a civil penalty. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that 63 P.S. &sect; 666(a)(8) of the Practical Nurse Law, 63 P.S. &sect;&sect; 651-667.8, which gave authority to respondent to refuse, suspend, or revoke a nursing license for unprofessional conduct, was constitutionally sound. The standards of nursing conduct provided a definite warning to petitioner of what could have constituted unprofessional conduct by setting forth an ascertainable standard against which conduct could have been measured. The court found that respondent was not required to have made a separate finding that petitioner's conduct was of such a serious nature as to have required suspension or revocation of her license before ordering a formal reprimand for her actions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of respondent, State Board of Nursing, which formally reprimanded petitioner nurse and assessed a civil penalty for engaging in unprofessional conduct. The court held that the statute that gave respondent authority to revoke or suspend a nursing license was constitutionally sound because the standards of nursing conduct gave petitioner fair warning of what constituted unprofessional conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania sought review of an order from the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County (Pennsylvania), which dismissed the criminal information. Defendant transportation corporation was charged with violating the Fish and Game Code after allowing corn syrup to leak out of a derailed car into the nearby river, killing approximately 10,000 fish.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a heavy rainfall and flooding, defendant transportation corporation's train tracks collapsed, and two trains derailed. As a result, one of the train cars broke open, and corn syrup leaked out and flowed into the nearby river, killing approximately 10,000 fish. Defendant was charged by information with violating the Fish and Game Code. The Pollution of Waters section of the Code imposed on the party with control over the harmful substance a duty to prevent it from entering commonwealth waters. Therefore, defendant was absolutely required while transporting hazardous materials not to allow those materials to enter the commonwealth's waters. The court found that the fact that the derailment was caused by rains and flooding did not relieve defendant of its duty to prevent the corn syrup from flowing into the river after the railcar broke open. The court reversed the order of the trial court, which dismissed the information filed against defendant, finding that because defendant's violation resulted in multiple fish being killed, subjecting it to a large fine did not mean that the individual penalties provided for in the applicable statute violated due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee school district filed a complaint against appellant property owner for tax arrearages. The trial court sustained appellee's preliminary objections to appellant's counterclaim, which the court subsequently dismissed, and denied appellant's preliminary objections to appellee's objections. On review, the court affirmed. The court found the sustaining of appellee's objections, even though filed beyond the 20 day statutory period found in Pa. R. Civ. P. 1026(a), was proper because the requirement was permissive and not mandatory. The court held that Pa. R. Civ. P. 1028(d) did not vest in appellant the absolute right to plead over after his preliminary objections to appellee's objections were overruled. The court noted that appellee's objections could be determined from the facts of record, alleged no facts outside the record, and did not require a notice to plead. The court found no error in the consideration of appellee's defense of governmental immunity and no error in dismissing appellant's objection in the nature of a demurrer after concluding he failed to assert any claim which fell within any category in which governmental immunity was waived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employee, a member of the State Employee's Retirement System, pled guilty to criminal conduct committed during the course of her employment. After notice and review, the State Employees' Retirement Board (board) ordered the discontinuance of her benefits as of the date of entry of the guilty plea pursuant to the Public Employee's Pension Forfeiture Act, 43 P.S. &sect;&sect; 1311-1315 (Act 140). Petitioner filed an appeal seeking the reversal of the board's order alleging it retroactively applied Act 140. On review, the court affirmed the decision because the board's action was not retroactive and was well within its statutory authority granted under Act 140. The court found that petitioner's acceptance of her new job as supervisor triggered the statutorily mandated affirmation of the terms of employment whereby she assented to the terms set forth in Act 140. The court held Act 140 specifically included &quot;rank and file&quot; employees and, therefore, found that petitioner was bound by Act 140. The court found petitioner failed to present case law or legal argument to support her claim that the imposition Act 140 was a violation of her civil rights.</SPAN></P>

The court held that petitioner was bound by the Public Employees' Pension Forfeiture Act (act) because although she was initially hired prior to the effective date of the act she assented to the act's terms upon her job promotion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellant, a real property owner, sought review of a decision by the Common Pleas Court, Lehigh County (Pennsylvania), which affirmed a decision by the respondent, a zoning hearing board, and denied the appellant's request to rebuild a partially destroyed building that had housed a nonconforming use and denied the appellant's alternative request for a variance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellant, a real property owner, applied to the respondent, a zoning hearing board, for a permit to rebuild a partially destroyed building that had housed a nonconforming use. In the alternative, the appellant sought a request for variance. The respondent denied the appellant's request for a permit, because it found that the prior nonconforming use had ceased, or been abandoned, continuation of uses which had been accessory to the nonconforming use before its move was not lawful, and the uses proposed in the appellant's application were not continuations of prior or existing nonconforming uses, but represented different nonconforming uses. In addition, the respondent denied the applicant's variance request. The trial court affirmed the respondent's decisions. On review, the court affirmed and held that the damage to the building constituted a partial destruction, instead of mere damage. Moreover, the court held that the appellant abandoned the pre-existing use of the property. Lastly, the court held that the appellant failed to meet its burden of proving an unnecessary hardship, which was sufficient to justify a variance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed and held that the appellant abandoned the prior nonconforming use of a building, which was partially destroyed by fire. Therefore, the respondent properly denied the appellant's request to reconstruct the building. In addition, the appellant failed to establish unnecessary hardship sufficient to justify the respondent's grant of a variance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While working for appellant electric company, appellant electrical contractor installed a 4160 volt wire on a transformer rated at only 600 volts. Appellee electrical contractors examining board then notified appellants that appellant electrical contractor's license would be suspended for 30 days because his act had been one of gross negligence under the Erie Building Code (Code), art. 1713.02(1)(5). The lower court affirmed the suspension because appellant electrical contractor had sufficient due process prior to the suspension. Appellants sought review, arguing that the Code was unconstitutional, vague, and overbroad insofar as it did not define what constituted acts of gross negligence. The court found that gross negligence was that which grossly deviated from the standard of care in question. Further, because the Code set forth the ordinary negligence standard, appellant electrical contractor's conduct, which grossly deviated from that standard, was gross negligence. Thus, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employer appealed from an opinion and order of the Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board (Pennsylvania) affirming, with a minor modification, the decision of the referee to grant in part and deny in part petitioner employer's petition to terminate, suspend, or modify the workmen's compensation benefits awarded to claimant employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant began receiving total disability benefits for a work-related injury. Five months later, petitioner employer sought to terminate, suspend, or modify the benefits, alleging that claimant had returned to work. Petitioner had taken an automatic supersedeas pursuant to &sect; 413(c) of the Workmen's Compensation Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 77, &sect; 774.2. The referee found that claimant had returned to work for three days when her total disability recurred. Because petitioner knew that claimant was no longer working at the time it filed its petition and took an automatic supersedeas, the referee assessed a penalty of 10 percent on the weekly benefits which should have been paid. Petitioner appealed the referee's decision. The finding that claimant had not fully recovered from her work injury, and that she was incapable of resuming her time-of-injury job was supported by substantial evidence. The modification of claimant's benefits was entirely proper given the testimony. Also, a penalty was properly imposed on petitioner for taking an automatic supersedeas because petitioner unilaterally terminated claimant's benefits for almost six months without written agreement or official order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order upholding the referee's decision in all respects because there was substantial evidence to support the referee's finding that claimant employee did not fully recover from her work injury, petitioner employer's unilateral suspension of benefits was in violation of claimant's rights, and the imposition of a penalty for violation of the statute was proper and well within the discretion of the referee.</SPAN></P>

The court treated petitioner's motion for summary judgment as a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court awarded judgment to respondent. According to the court, the statute did not violate the uniformity provision under art. VIII, &sect; 1 because the state constitution did not require uniformity of tax burden over several years. The state tax base for that year was the same and the rate was unvarying for all corporations. Due process was not violated because a tax deduction was not a vested right of the taxpayer and was subject to repeal and suspension by the legislature at any time. The statute did not breach a quasi-contract because petitioner offered no proof that respondent was unjustly enriched by the petitioner's conduct of business in the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner filed a challenge to the validity of a zoning code, pursuant to 53 P.S. &sect; 10916.1, and contended that the code did not provide for a fair share of small residential lots and was unconstitutionally exclusionary. The court noted that the parties agreed that the community was a logical area for development and its present level of development did not preclude further development. The court stated that the question then became focused on determining the exclusionary impact of the zoning ordinance. Appellant argued that the zoning ordinance failed to make an adequate provision for single-family detached housing for low-to-moderate income families, which appellant equated with discrimination against minorities. The court stated that under Pennsylvania law, appellee municipality was only required to provide a fair share of various housing types, it was not required to provide a range of lot sizes for single-family housing. Therefore, appellant's challenge failed. Appellant's challenge on equal protection grounds also failed because appellant failed to show racially discriminatory intent or purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the lower court which affirmed the denial of appellant landowner's challenge to appellee municipality's zoning code was affirmed because appellant failed to demonstrate that appellee municipality failed to provide a fair share of dwelling types.</SPAN></P>

Respondent filed a motion to open the peremptory judgment in mandamus, questioning whether the issuance of the execution warrants was at his discretion and not subject to mandamus order. The court denied respondent's motion ruling that his inaction or inordinate delay constituted a breach of his statutory duty to take care that the laws were faithfully executed. The court held that in order for a reprieve to have had meaning, respondent should have issued the death warrant. The court concluded that there was no basis to reopen the mandamus judgment, noting that respondent had sufficient time to issue the warrants.

Const. art. VI, &sect; 4, in connection with petitioner's misbehavior in office resulting in criminal proceedings against him. The court first determined the issue of whether the case involved justiciable questions had to be resolved by resort to interpreting the text of the state and U.S. Const. The court reasoned that it was barred from intervening with the impeachment process in the present unique case where petitioner sought an exercise of prior restraint upon the senate and its adjudicative impeachment function. The court found the constitutional protection against double jeopardy was inapplicable when the impeachment process clearly did not displace criminal liability; impeachment could never be construed as a charge to which there might have been a criminal court conviction. The court found it lacked power to intervene in advance of legislative action, and petitioner failed to establish the alleged manifest wrong or that his right to legal relief was clear for purposes of an injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers sought review of the order that granted appellee Perry County Board of Commissioners' petition to increase property tax millage. The court denied appellee's motion to dismiss for failure to comply with Pa. R. Civ. P 235 because appellants complied with Pa. R. Civ. P. 521(a) and the attorney general did not seek intervention in the appeal or raise the lack of notice as his reason for not intervening. The court affirmed the order because appellants did not overcome the presumption that 16 P.S. &sect; 1770 was constitutional. The court held that &sect; 1770 did not grant the judiciary the power to tax because it could only review appellee's decision. The court held that &sect; 1770 was not vague because the plain language of &sect; 1770 provided discretion in the trial court to determine whether due cause existed to warrant additional millage without giving it the authority to review the wisdom of the underlying legislative decision. The court held that the due cause standard was sufficiently specific to guide the trial court's review.</SPAN></P>

XIV, &sect; 1, or the Uniformity Clause, Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, in its raising of the two-year boat registration fee authorized by 30 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 5308 and 5104.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner boatowner paid a two-year boat registration fee in 1992 after the legislature had increased the annual fee from $ 6 to $ 15 under 30 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5104. Petitioner brought a purported class action against respondent Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, asserting that persons paying their fee for 1992-1993 were discriminated against as compared to those paying for 1991-1992. Respondent found that its staggered two-year system was proper under 30 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5308, and petitioner appealed. The court, however, affirmed the ruling, finding first that the fee was not a tax and that the Uniformity Clause, Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, did not apply. The court further opined that, even if it did, neither it nor the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, had been violated by the raising of the fee or its implementation in a two-year system because the legislature had the power to increase the fees, and respondent had the rational reason of reducing administrative costs when it implemented the two-year system.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling of respondent Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission in which it found no violation of equal protection or the tax uniformity clause in charging petitioner boatowner more for a 1992-1993 registration than previous owners were charged for their 1991-1992 registrations. A rational basis existed for the difference in fees.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that appellant failed to allege any facts to support his claim of discriminatory enforcement of the code. The court additionally held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding appellant's testimony that he made substantial efforts to provide decent housing for the tenants and to comply with the general intent of the ordinance to be incredible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent commonwealth incurred a shortfall in budget expectations when a tax on banks was declared unconstitutional and respondent was required to repay amounts collected under the invalid tax. A decree nisi was issued granting petitioner bank's request for a refund of improperly paid bank share taxes. Respondent issued credits to banks impacted and imposed a different tax in order to attempt to recoup its shortfall. Petitioner challenged the validity of both the credit in lieu of a refund and the imposition of the new tax. The court found held that recoupment of an unplanned shortfall in state tax receipts was a legitimate legislative concern. The court also found that respondent's method of averaging bank values over a period of years was a reliable method of determining value. A tax credit that was available only to banks which were chartered after a set date was found by the court to be unconstitutional. Creation of a tax class based solely upon the date that an entity was created violated uniformity of taxation. Because that tax credit portion of the code sought to be enacted was severable, only those sections of the code tied to the provision were stricken.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent public utility commission issued certificates of public convenience to the owner of petitioner water companies. Petitioner water companies entered into an agreement, whereby petitioner company agreed to purchase all of the owner's shares of capital stock in the companies. Petitioner company was required to file applications with respondent for certificates of public convenience. Respondent dismissed the applications and ordered petitioner company to transfer possession and control of petitioner water companies to their owner. The court affirmed respondent's decision. The sales agreement between petitioner company and the owner was unlawful under 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1102(a)(3). Petitioner company's due process rights were not violated because the administrative law judge properly dismissed the case due to deficiencies in the applications. Moreover, petitioner company offered no evidence that respondent accepted the owner's applications without signing or transcribing the application. Therefore, its equal protection rights were not violated. Finally, under 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3301(a) and &sect; 3301(b), respondent was authorized to impose a fine upon petitioner company.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners and respondent county and Department of Natural Resources (DER) filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The court granted respondents summary judgment as to the claims challenging the Act and the waste management plan, holding that the Environmental Hearing Board had sole jurisdiction over challenges to county plans approved by respondent DER. However, the court granted petitioners summary judgment as to the claim challenging the flow-control ordinance, holding that it unconstitutionally burdened commerce by precluding the transportation of county-generated waste to out-of-state facilities.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners challenged the decision of the Board of Views (Board), which recommended laying out a private road across their property pursuant to the Private Road Act (Act), 36 P.S. &sect;&sect; 2731 - 2891. The trial court denied appellants' post-trial motions and confirmed the Board's recommendation, holding that the statute did not authorize the taking of private property for private uses but was a constitutional use of eminent domain power. On appeal, appellant challenged the taking for both constitutional and substantive reasons. The court held that establishing roads to open landlocked property had public as well as private uses and that the Act was not unconstitutional. The court held that the Board made specific findings of fact that the properties were landlocked and that, therefore, a private road was necessary and that, after taking all relevant things into account, the road should have been opened, as it was an established roadbed and its use required significantly less construction or maintenance and caused the least harm to the properties.

Respondent, Department of Labor and Industry, filed a demurrer alleging that petitioner failed to state a cause of action. The court held that even if some of petitioner's members had paid for prescriptions for which they had not been reimbursed fully, the language of &sect; 8 imposed no individual liabilities to employees and in no way impaired petitioner's members' rights to have prescriptions paid for by respondent and consequently did not violate the contract clauses of the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions.

On appeal, petitioner argued that respondent's findings that the paving company had provided for an adequate intersection, which was required by the permit, were not supported by substantial evidence. The court found that respondent's issuance of the permit was a reasonable exercise of its regulatory power. Furthermore, respondent had the authority to issue permits for the opening of driveways onto state highways. The court found that it could not hold that respondent lacked substantial evidence to issue the permit to the paving company. The hearing officer, as fact-finder, determined credibility of witnesses including experts, and the fact that he chose to believe one over the other did not make his finding capricious or demonstrate that he deliberately ignored evidence. Therefore, the court found that respondent did not err in issuing the permit.</SPAN></P>
