</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant master plumbers challenged the decision of the trial court (Florida), which dismissed their declaratory judgment action with prejudice. The issue was whether appellants were entitled to have the trial court determine their rights concerning appellee state department's interpretation of a licensing statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the Declaratory Judgment Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 86, appellant master plumbers sought a declaration of their rights with relation to their status under a grandfather provision of a statute. They wanted to know whether their prior competency certification would be sufficient, or whether a new examination would be required to be taken and passed to obtain certification subsequent to the effective date of the statute. The trial court granted a motion by appellee state department to dismiss. On appeal, the court discussed the provisions of the statute and when dismissal of a declaratory judgment action was proper and improper. The court held that the test of the sufficiency of a complaint in a declaratory judgment proceeding was not whether the complaint showed that a party would succeed in getting a declaration of rights in accordance with the party's theory and contention, but whether the party was entitled to a declaration of rights at all. The court held that it was proper for appellants to seek a determination of their rights under the licensing statute. The court reversed and remanded, and ordered the trial court to reach a declaratory judgment on the issue raised.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that appellant master plumbers had a right to seek a determination of their rights under the licensing statute. Simple dismissal of the action, pursuant to appellee state department's motion, was an ambiguous and unsatisfactory determination, which left the issues undecided. The court reversed and remanded, ordering that proceedings culminate in a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county passed an ordinance that imposed a land use fee to pay for expanding infrastructure to accommodate growth. The ordinance was estimated to raise six million dollars the first year of its existence. Plaintiff developers challenged the ordinance, arguing that defendant did not have authority to enact the ordinance because the fee was a tax, and that the ordinance was discriminatory and therefore unconstitutional. The trial court held that the ordinance was invalid. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the ordinance was an improper tax. The court noted that the only purpose for which a city might impose a fee was to offset the expenses of regulation and the large amount of revenue expected from the ordinance did not approximate any cost of regulation. The court held that the fee was an exercise of taxing power, contravening Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1(a) (1968), which preempted taxation to the state. As the court found the ordinance invalid, it did not reach plaintiffs' constitutional claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant teacher sought review of the decision of a Florida trial court, which denied appellant's writ of mandamus, in an action seeking to compel appellee school board to grant him a continuing contract as a school teacher; to reinstate him as a teacher, and to award him back pay, under Fla. Stat. ch. 231.36(3)(a)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant teacher was charged, and held without bond, for first degree murder near the end of the term of his third year as a high school teacher. Appellant was subsequently found not guilty by reason of temporary insanity. Before the end of the third year term, while in jail, appellant was suspended. Shortly after the term ended, appellee school board dismissed appellant. Following denied requests for a hearing with appellee, appellant sought a writ of mandamus to compel a continuing contract, to reinstate him, and to award him back pay, arguing that his three years entitled him to the equivalent of tenure under Fla. Stat. ch. 231.36(3)(a)(2). The trial court denied the writ. The court affirmed, holding that appellant never achieved tenure status because he was incarcerated, due to his own actions, before the three years had concluded. The court ruled that appellant was not entitled to a hearing because it would be too much to ask the school board to hold a hearing every time it determined to not renew the contract of a probationary teacher, or even every time a terminated teacher requested a hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of the writ of mandamus in favor of appellee school board because appellant teacher never achieved tenure status as he was jailed, due to his own actions, before the required three years on the job, and appellant was not entitled to a hearing as it would be an undue burden on school boards to give all probationary teachers or terminated teachers the right to a hearing absent allegations of unconstitutional action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, whose license had been suspended pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 322.27(5), applied for a post-revocation hearing. Respondent, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, a political subdivision of the State of Florida, denied petitioner's application for a hearing. Petitioner challenged the constitutionality of respondent's denial. The court held that petitioner was entitled to a hearing, held either before or after the license revocation. The court noted that suspension of issued licenses involved state action that adjudicated important interests of the licensees, and the licenses were not to be taken away without that procedural due process required by the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the order of the trial court (Florida), which convicted him on two counts of aggravated assault and imposed consecutive sentences without ordering a presentence investigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimed that the trial judge erred in failing to order a presentence investigation report in accordance with Fla. Stat. ch. 921.23 (1974) when imposing consecutive sentences for two counts of aggravated assault. He was over 18 and he had a prior felony record. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court applied Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.710 rather than ch. 921.23. Under rule 3.710, the trial court had discretion in deciding on the sentence. It was not required to order a presentence investigation in cases where the party charged was over 18 and had a prior felony, as with appellant. As that rule was adopted by the Florida Supreme Court, the legislative could not modify it through a procedural statute such as ch. 921.23. Thus, the trial court acted properly in applying the rule rather than the statutory provision. Further, to the extent the statute was inconsistent with that rule, the court held it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed conviction of appellant on two counts of aggravated assault with consecutive sentences, as the sentencing decision was within the trial court's discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant department of revenue challenged the judgment of the trial court (Florida), which held that appellee oil company's leasehold interest in oil, gas, and minerals was not subject to ad valorem real property taxation under Fla. Stat. ch. 193.481 (1971). The issue was whether such a lease constituted a taxable possessory interest in real property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee oil company had the right to explore for, drill for, and extract oil and minerals at lessor's property. Appellant department of revenue sought to impose an ad valorem real property tax on those rights. The trial court ruled against appellant. On appeal, the court stated that appellee had two rights: a right to explore for, and a right to drill and extract, oil and minerals. The court distinguished a case relied upon by the trial court, because it dealt only with the first right. The court stated that, ordinarily, leasehold interests in private real property were not subject to ad valorem taxation, but they could be if the legislature so intended. The court held that declaring the leases in the case to be taxable as real property would meet the test of a reasonable classification for a valid public purpose. Based upon the court's review of the legislative history, the court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 193.481(1) (1971) did subject the leases to ad valorem real property taxation, because the legislature failed to exclude them and the term &quot;separate and apart from the fee&quot; must refer to them. The court held that the statute was constitutional. The court reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statute was constitutional. The court reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a jury verdict from the trial court (Florida), denying defendant's motion for postconviction relief pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850, which contended that defendant had been convicted of an offense for which he was not charged, to wit, entering without breaking a truck with intent to commit petit larceny.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the jury's decision convicting him of the offense of entering without breaking a truck with intent to commit a crime therein, to wit, petit larceny, as prohibited by Fla. Stat. ch. 810.051. The criminal information had charged defendant under the same statute with the offense of breaking and entering a truck with the intent to commit petit larceny. Defense counsel filed an Anders brief on direct appeal, and defendant's conviction was affirmed without discussion. Defendant then filed a Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion for postconviction relief, arguing that he was convicted of a crime for which he had not been charged, a result that violated state and federal constitutional guarantees. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court held that it was improper to convict defendant under Fla. Stat. ch. 810.051 of &quot;entering without breaking&quot; when the criminal information charged him with &quot;breaking and entering&quot; because the information alleged one set of facts while another set of facts were proved at trial. Defendant's conviction constituted fundamental error. The court reversed and vacated defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for postconviction relief because defendant was unconstitutionally convicted of a crime with which he was not charged. Although the crimes of &quot;breaking and entering&quot; a vehicle to commit petit larceny and &quot;entering without breaking&quot; a vehicle to commit petit larceny were criminalized by the same statute, the offenses required different proof.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant funeral society maintained, prepared, and disposed of dead human bodies, but were not licensed to do so in accordance with Fla.

Appellee state funeral directors and embalmers board filed an action against appellant seeking injunctive relief to prevent appellant's activities as they fell within the scope of funeral directing as defined in ch. 470.01(3). The trial court issued an injunction against the appellant and held, in ruling on a partial summary judgment motion, that appellant had engaged in funeral directing activities in violation of statute. Appellant filed an interlocutory seeking review of the trial court's partial summary judgment and enjoinment of the appellant contending constitutional violations. The court affirmed the trial court's partial summary judgment and injunction concluding that if any one of appellant's activities had violated the funeral directing statute, that alone justified issuance of an injunction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee county granted an exclusive license to a cab company which entitled the company to use certain parking places around appellee's airport. Appellant corporation sued appellee, alleging its agreement with the company was entered into without competitive bidding as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 125.35 (1973). The trial court granted appellee's motion to dismiss appellant's complaint, and appellant sought the court's review. The court held that under ch. 125.35, the board of county commissioners could not lease real property unless notice thereof was published once a week for at least two weeks calling for bids for the lease of the property to be leased. Here, appellee asserted that because the Airport Law, Fla. Stat. ch. 332.08 (1973), did not specifically require bidding, no bidding was required. However, in the absence of specific legislative declaration to that effect, the fact that appellant was authorized under ch. 332.08 to enter into long term leases for purposes consistent with the use of an airport did not give appellee the right to ignore the competitive bidding requirements which would be otherwise applicable under ch. 125.35. Judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellants' convictions for the murder of two gas station attendants during a robbery. The court rejected appellants' 12 arguments for reversal. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict. The court found that the jury selection process in the county was fair and did not arbitrarily exclude black persons and that statistical evidence upheld that conclusion. The court found that the prosecutor could constitutionally use his peremptory challenges to strike all black jurors. The court held that the trial court properly denied a motion for change of venue when pretrial publicity had not compromised appellants' ability to receive a fair trial. The court held that prosecutor's statements in closing arguments were fair response to defense counsel arguments. Finally, the court concluded that the confession of a third-party to the crime was not admissible. The court based that decision on holdings that the witness was not unavailable when he invoked his right to remain silent and that statements against penal interest were not exceptions to the hearsay rule in Florida.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that Rule 7A-4.50 transcended the bounds of the various sections of Fla. Stat. ch. 561and that its enforcement would do irreparable harm to appellants. The trial court rejected these contentions and rendered summary final judgment in favor of appellee, and appellant sought review. The appellate court affirmed. The appellate court found that Rule 7A-4.50 effectuated the intention and purpose of the legislature expressed in Fla. Stat. ch. 561.14(3), by allowing small vendors to &quot;pool purchase&quot; large quantities of alcoholic beverages at the same price made available to large vendors and distributors. Thus, the appellate court concluded that Rule 7A-4.50 bore a reasonable relationship to the statutory scheme and was a valid and enforceable rule.

Defendant also requested that enforcement of the statute be enjoined and requested expungement of the records of those charged under the statute. The court affirmed the trial court's order that convicted and sentenced defendant. The court held that defendant could not attack the constitutionality of the statute because there was no justiciable controversy.

Appellants were non-residents and service of process was attempted pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 48.194 (1973).

The trial court denied the motion to dismiss and appellants filed an interlocutory appeal of the order.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services sought review of eight orders from the Circuit Court for Alachua County (Florida), which granted petitions for involuntary admission of appellee individuals to appellant's services, and directed appellant to provide certain prescribed treatment and perform other acts at the discretion of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted petitions to involuntarily admit eight appellee individuals to services furnished by appellant department of health, and directed appellant to provide appellees with certain prescribed treatment, and to perform various other acts at the discretion of the trial court. On consolidated appeals, the appellate court reversed because Fla. Stat. ch. 393 only set forth the requisites for involuntary admission, and did not authorize the court to direct the treatment that was to be furnished by appellant, or to supervise the treatment and placement of appellees. Fla. Stat. ch. 393.01(2) specifically provided that the person involuntarily admitted to a residential program was to be appellant's responsibility until the individual was discharged or released to the custody of parent or guardian, and that appellant was to assign the person to an appropriate residential program as it deemed proper. Although the statute required a report of the committing authority to accompany the order of involuntary admission to residential care, it did not authorize the court to direct that the report be implemented.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the trial court's revocation of his probation. The trial court had found that defendant had violated a condition of probation requiring defendant to &quot;live honorably&quot; because defendant was charged with unlawfully breaking and entering a dwelling house with intent to commit petit larceny. On appeal, the court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 924.06(2)(1973) limited defendant's ability to appeal to those proceedings occurring after the entry of the order of probation. Having chosen to accept the conditions of probation as imposed, defendant was not entitled to challenge those conditions on their merits after having violated one of them. The court also found that non-hearsay evidence provided direct, competent evidence to prove that defendant had violated probation. Stolen items were found inside defendant's car after defendant gave his consent to search. The court affirmed the trial court's revocation of defendant's probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order revoking defendant's probation because defendant was barred by statute from attacking the merits of the condition of probation that he was found guilty of violating and because sufficient evidence supported the finding that defendant had failed to &quot;live honorably&quot; by committing petit larceny by breaking and entering a dwelling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another person were on a sailboat when it caught fire. Both suffered severe injuries and the other person died. The fire chief and a fireman boarded the vessel, used fire fighting apparatus to put out the flames, and, according to Kendall, observed candles, paper, lacquers, thinners, acetone, and plastic bags full of gasoline. That evidence was the foundation of the state's case for arson. Defendant was convicted of conspiracy to commit third degree arson, attempt to burn a boat or vessel, the property of another, by placing flammable liquid in or about the boat, or fourth degree arson, and unlawfully placing on the boat a flammable or explosive substance with intent to burn. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding the evidence found on the boat was admissible because the firemen were on the boat performing lawful duties, and the evidence was in plain view. The court found that testimony by an officer on defendant's exercise of his U.S. Const. amend. V rights was in response to defense's question and therefore not grounds for mistrial. The court affirmed the ten-year sentence, finding that the statutory penalty in effect at the time of the criminal act governed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant tax assessor sought review of an order of the trial court (Florida), which granted summary judgment to appellee, a nonprofit corporate home for the aged, in its action to maintain its exempt status from ad valorem taxation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a nonprofit corporate home for the aged, argued that the trial properly upheld its ad valorem tax exemption because the contracts of home residents satisfied the requirements of a grandfather clause, 1971 Fla. Laws. ch. 71-133, which granted homes for the aged caring for other than low income persons a two-year exemption if they were contractually prohibited from passing the burden along to the residents. The court agreed in part, noting first that an exemption could not be predicated upon the income of residents, but only upon the home's overall use as a charitable institution. While appellee satisfied this test, the court then inspected the residential contracts to see if they precluded appellee from passing the tax burden on to its residents. While recognizing that appellee's cost of operation had been increasing more than the normal permissible increase appellee was permitted, the court observed that of the two forms of contract only one expressly provided for residents to assume their proportionate share of applicable state taxes The court concluded, as ad valorem taxes were, in effect, state taxes, appellee must be denied an exemption on units of these residents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order affirmed granting summary judgment to appellee, a nonprofit corporate home for the aged, in its action to maintain its exempt status from ad valorem taxation, but only to the extent that residential contracts did not allow for the tax to be passed on to residents; otherwise, order was reversed, because statutory grandfather clause allowed for exemption to be denied when appellee was contractually permitted to pass tax on to residents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee adult theater showed various pornographic films to the public. A police officer went to two of the films and found the content to be obscene under Fla. Stat. ch. 847.011. The officer then sought the assistance of appellant state and completed the paperwork to obtain a search warrant for the films. The officer went to the judge and told him under oath that the sex acts depicted in the films were violative of the statute. The trial judge, finding probable cause existed, issued the warrant and demanded that the films be seized. After a hearing, the trial judge said that the warrant was improperly issued and ordered the return of the films to appellee. Appellant filed an interlocutory appeal. The court affirmed and held that the trial court properly invalidated the warrant because in order for the films to have been seized, the officer should have made sure that other copies existed, viewed the film to determine whether the films were obscene per se, and then requested the warrant. Having not complied with those requirements, the warrant was quashed, as were the fruits of the warrant, and the interlocutory appeal was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied appellant state's interlocutory motion, holding that it was improper for the judge to order seizure of the only existing copies of the films because before they could have been seized, a pre-determination of obscenity vel non was required to have been made. The court quashed the warrant and the fruits of the warrant, returned the films, and affirmed the lower court's ruling.</SPAN></P>

The court found that &sect; 443.06(2)(a) did not state or it could not be inferred that respondent was to consider whether acceptance of employment will cause claimants' union to impose sanctions on them and thus, entitle them not to accept offered work by petitioner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted appellant's petition for rehearing and withdrew its former opinion. Appellant was charged with assault with intent to commit rape. At a preliminary hearing, a Justice of the Peace found probable cause only for assault with intent to commit sodomy, which was later changed to lewd and lascivious conduct, Fla. Stat. ch. 800.02(1973), to which appellant pled guilty. Appellant was later charged by information, filed in the circuit court, with assault with intent to commit rape. He entered a nolo contendere plea and reserved the right to appeal to determine whether his adjudication of guilt on the lesser charge precluded his conviction of assault with intent to commit rape. The court stated that the prosecution for the higher offense was not precluded as the Justice of the Peace, sitting as committing magistrate, had no authority to reduce the felony charge alleged in the complaint, Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 11(2); Fla. Stat. ch. 37.01(1971); Fla. Stat. chs. 937.02 and 937.05. Absent special statutory authority, such an amendment could only be made with the consent of the prosecution or upon the filing of a complaint charging an offense within the justice's jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for assault with intent to commit rape was affirmed because the Justice of the Peace had no authority to reduce the felony charges alleged in the complaint, and therefore, the justice court's acceptance of appellant's guilty plea on the lesser charge did not bar prosecution for the higher offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought review, by way of certiorari, of an order of respondent board of pharmacy (Florida) that revoked petitioner's license to practice pharmacy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent board of pharmacy charged petitioner with violating Fla. Stat. chs. 465.101(1)(e) and 465.18(2)(c), contending petitioner had delivered, or caused to be delivered, without a prescription certain prescription drugs on three separate occasions. Petitioner was also charged criminally based upon the same occurrences. Initially, respondent agreed to delay any proceedings until after trial on the criminal charges. However, the criminal matter was delayed, and respondent did not agree to additional continuances. After a hearing, respondent entered an order finding petitioner guilty of two of the three counts of the complaint and revoking petitioner's license to practice pharmacy. In response, petitioner sought a writ of certiorari. The court denied the writ because respondent accorded petitioner due process and did not infringe upon his right to remain silent. In addition, the court found there was competent substantial evidence to support the findings and judgment of respondent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioner's request for a writ of certiorari because petitioner was never asked or required to testify or to give any sworn statement and respondent board assumed the burden of proof of the charges against petitioner, and substantial competent evidence was presented to support the charges of which petitioner was found guilty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners filed a personal injury action against respondents, county, sheriff, and insurers, for personal injuries arising from the shooting of petitioner victim. One of the carriers filed a motion to sever pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 455.06(2). The trial court granted the motion and petitioners moved to set aside the trial court's order of severance. The trial court denied the motion and petitioners sought certiorari review of the severance order. The court denied the petition and petitioners requested certiorari review with the Florida Supreme Court, which granted the writ. The Supreme Court found a conflict with case law that held ch. 455.06(2) to be unconstitutional. It quashed the court's decision and remanded for further proceedings. The court reinstated the petition for writ of certiorari. It determined that the rule adopted by the supreme court as reflected in case law was dispositive of the issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction from a Florida trial court for raping a female under 11 years old. Appellant alleged that his jacket was improperly admitted into evidence, that appellee state failed to prove an essential element of his offense, and that Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082(1) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted and sentenced for raping a female under 11 years old. On appeal, the court affirmed appellant's conviction for three reasons. First, appellant's jacket was properly admitted into evidence and did not result from an unreasonable search and seizure. The court ruled that the testimony showed appellant's mother knowingly consented to a warrantless search of her premises, she went into appellant's bedroom, found his jacket, and gave it to the police officer. Second, appellant's motions for a judgment of acquittal and for new trial were properly denied because sufficient circumstantial evidence supported the jury's verdict. The court noted the medical testimony about the lacerations of the vagina, the child's testimony that he was on top of her, and testimony that semen stain on the child's undergarments matched appellant's blood type. Third, Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082(1) was constitutional and permissible because Fla. Const. art. IV, 8(c) did not bar the legislature from establishing minimum conditions under which parole may be granted for particularly heinous crimes whose alternative penalty was death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for raping a female under 11 years old, holding that appellant's jacket was not the product of an unreasonable search and seizure because appellant's mother, whom appellant lived with, consented to a warrantless search of her premises, discovered appellant's jacket and turned it over to the police.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the effective date of the 1970 Federal Decennial Census, appellant county commissioners requested appellee clerk of circuit court to pay them a salary as provided by the schedule in Fla. Stat. 145.031(4) based on the new population bracket for the county. Appellee refused and limited the salary increase to 20 percent pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 145.121(2)(b). Appellants filed a complaint for declaratory relief, and the circuit court held that the 20 percent limitation did apply. On appeal, the court reversed this order, holding that it was the intent of the legislature, as reflected by Fla. Stat. ch. 145.011, that the 20 percent limitation contained in Fla. Stat. ch. 145.121(2)(b) was applicable to the compensation of county officials whose compensation prior to the effective date of the act was less than the compensation payable under the schedules set forth in the act, without regard to any change caused by application of the 1970 census. Therefore, the court determined that the 20 percent limitation did not apply when appellants were entitled to a salary increase under the Federal Decennial Census.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was arrested and charged with violation of a law prohibiting possession of obscene material. The charges were dismissed after which she filed suit against appellant city for false arrest and false imprisonment based on the actions of its police officers. The trial court instructed the jury that based on a Supreme Court decision, the mere private possession of obscene material was not a crime. The trial court refused an instruction requested by the city to the effect that at the time of the arrest, the constitutionality of the specific ordinance involved had not been determined. The jury returned a verdict for appellee and appellant city sought review. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial. The instruction given was correct, because it was a correct summary of the law. However, police were entitled to a defense based on a good faith belief in the validity of the law they were enforcing, so the trial court erred by refusing the requested instruction. Even though the arrest was illegal and unconstitutional, the jury could return a verdict for appellant if they believed that the police officers reasonably believed in good faith that the arrest was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent agency revoked petitioner's driver's license for a period of five years. The revocation was predicated upon petitioner having been convicted of 15 moving traffic offenses during a five year period so as to become an habitual traffic offender as defined under Fla. Stat. ch. 322.264. Petitioner requested a hearing to show cause why his license should be revoked. A hearing was held, however, respondent denied reinstatement of petitioner's driver's license. On certiorari, petitioner argued that he was not afforded a hearing prior to the revocation of his driver's license. The court found that under Fla. Stat. ch. 322.264(5), any person whose license was revoked could show cause why his license should not be revoked. Because there was no suggestion that this provision could not be invoked prior to revocation, the court did not believe the subsection was unconstitutional on its face. As applied in this case, it might be, were it not for the fact that petitioner ultimately had the hearing upon which he insisted and the arguments which he made at the hearing were properly rejected. Accordingly, the petition for certiorari was denied as moot.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of appellee and appellants sought review of that decision.

Appellants sought to have comparative negligence applied in the case, and the court agreed. The court quashed the judgment of the trial court and directed the case to be tried in light of the new ruling, holding that the Supreme Court's decision had the same effect as a decision of the legislature to abolish contributory negligence and institute comparative negligence in its stead. The court found that it should, therefore, apply the law in place at the time of the appellate disposition, not at the time of the trial, and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners challenged the trial court's denial of their petition for a writ of certiorari to review the decision of appellee county, which refused to rezone a tract of land owned by a land development corporation. The court affirmed and found that it was not reversible error where Fla. Stat. Ann. ch. 286.012 was violated when a commissioner voluntarily left a proceeding, because any member could then frustrate official action by leaving a proceeding. The court found that it was debatable that appellants' proposal to rezone the land was in the public interest and it was not found that appellee violated its statutory duty in its refusal to rezone. The court found that there was no evidence that appellee refused to rezone on the basis of a private contract with the land developer or failed to consider the public interest. The court concluded that it was not the function of courts to question the motive of appellee, but to determine whether appellee acted in an unreasonable, confiscatory, or unconstitutional manner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court, entered upon a jury verdict, rejecting his insanity defense and convicting him of first-degree murder, following his objections to the grand jury and trial jury pools, a finding that he was competent to stand trial, admittance into evidence of certain photographs, and refusal of his jury instruction on the Durham Rule of insanity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted an insanity defense when he was charged with first-degree murder. In finding that he was competent to stand trial, the trial court considered evidence that was admitted through an interpreter. Defendant's objections on due process grounds to the grand jury and trial jury pools were rejected, as were his objections to the admission of certain photographs of the victim. At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial court instructed the jury as to the M'Naghten Rule of insanity and rejected defendant's request for a Durham Rule instruction. Defendant was convicted and he appealed. The grand jury issue was transferred to the Florida Supreme Court, which affirmed the ruling on that issue and retransferred the case to the appellate court. In affirming the conviction, the court ruled that the selection of the trial jury did not violate defendant's due process rights and the admission of the photographs was not error. It was not improper to admit evidence through an interpreter and the finding of competency was supported by competent substantial evidence. Moreover, a Durham rule instruction was improper because Florida used the M'Naghten Rule of insanity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant loaned items to appellees for use at a state museum of art pursuant to an indefinite loan agreement. Appellant later filed an action against appellees in Leon County, the county of appellees' official headquarters, to determine the parties' rights and responsibilities under the agreement. Appellees filed a successful motion for a change of venue pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 47.122, asserting that another county was a more convenient forum for the suit. On appeal, appellant did not contest that the county to which the action was transferred was more convenient. Rather, it asserted that appellees could only be sued in the county of their headquarters. The court affirmed the order transferring the case. It held that in actions primarily involving the interpretation of agency rules, the agency could waive the privilege of litigating in the county of its official headquarters. When appellees filed a motion to change venue, they waived their privilege of being sued in Leon County. Because it was uncontested on appeal that the county to which the case was transferred was a more convenient forum, the order transferring the case was affirmed and the appeal was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state government arrested appellee on unspecified charges. Prior to trial, appellee moved to suppress certain evidence acquired against him during a search. The trial court, noting that Fla. R. Crim.

Appellant took an interlocutory appeal, and on appeal the trial court's order was reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings. The court held that it had jurisdiction, not the state supreme court, because a rule of procedure was involved, not a provision of the constitution. The court also held that Rule 3.190(h)(3) was not unconstitutional, because it merely placed upon appellee the burden of presenting a prima facie case of invalidity, after which appellant must if need be show the validity of its search. Because appellee's suppression hearing testimony was inadmissible at trial, there was no compelled violation of his self-incrimination privilege.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant sought review of a judgment from the trial court (Florida) that denied his motion for judgment of acquittal. He also alleged that Fla. Stat. &sect; 832.05(6) was unconstitutional and that his sentence was excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, criminal defendant presented three points for review. First he argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because the evidence was legally insufficient to prove intent. In light of the record, the court found that this point did not establish error. Second, he argued the unconstitutionality of Fla. Stat. &sect; 832.05(6). The court examined his contention in the light of the argument advanced in his brief and found that the argument was not sufficient as a basis upon which to declare the section invalid. Third, he argued that the sentence was excessive because the court found the appellant guilty of a misdemeanor in the second degree for which the maximum sentence was sixty days in prison. The court ruled that Fla. Stat. &sect; 948.04 provided that a trial court could place a defendant on probation for two years beyond the maximum term provided for the offense by statute; therefore, two years plus sixty days was the maximum period for probation on this offense. As a result, the sentence was to be amended by reducing the term of probation to two years and sixty days. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed, and the sentence was amended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found for criminal defendant on his third issue. It affirmed the trial court's judgment, but amended defendant's sentence. The court held that the relevant statute provided that a trial court could place a defendant on probation for two years beyond the maximum term provided for the offense by statute; therefore, two years plus sixty days was the maximum period for probation on the offense.</SPAN></P>

R. Crim. P. 3.191, Florida's speedy trial rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator filed a motion to dismiss first-degree murder charges on the grounds of the unconstitutionality of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 782.04, 775.082 and 921.141. Respondent trial judge granted state's motion to certify the questions raised in the motion to dismiss to the Florida Supreme Court. Relator filed a motion to discharge pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.191(a)(1), the speedy trial rule, which was denied and a trial date was set. Relator then filed request for writ of prohibition, claiming that respondent was without jurisdiction and seeking an absolute discharge under rule 3.191(a)(1). The question presented for the court's determination was whether the time limitations set forth in the speedy trial rule were tolled. The court found that respondent was warranted in properly not setting the case for trial until he could dispose of relator's motion to dismiss that raised constitutional questions. The record showed that counsel for relator would not proceed with pretrial discovery until the motion to dismiss was ruled upon. The court denied the request for writ of prohibition and the rule to show cause dissolved, because a valid reason existed for the delay of relator's trial.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that the trial court erred and violated the state and federal constitutions in sentencing him to an illegal sentence. Secondly, he also contended that the trial court erred in revoking his probation because the probation revocation hearing was unconstitutional, unfair, and violated the minimum fundamental requirements of due process. The court found these contentions without merit, but reversed for other reasons. The court found that the trial judge made an improper statement in court. The court reasoned that a judge must not only be impartial, but he should leave the impression of his impartiality upon all that attend court. The court could not find from the written record that the court below failed this standard, but in the interest of justice, the cause was remanded with instructions to vacate the sentence and for re-sentence to be pronounced by a different judge who was able to order the presentence investigation brought to date.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the order was supported by substantial evidence that petitioner knew that the person employed to work as a barmaid in its lounge was under age 21. Even if petitioner had no positive knowledge that the employee was 19, it failed to exercise the degree of diligence imposed upon it as a licensee to determine her correct age before entering into an employment contract. However, the court quashed the order, because 1973 Fla. Laws ch. 73-365, the amendment to ch. 562.13, was enacted prior to the final determination of the case and applied retrospectively to permit petitioner to employ persons who had were 18 or older. The court refused to apply retrospectively 1973 Fla. Laws ch. 73-21, which removed the disabilities of nonage from persons 18 or older and specifically provided for prospective operation.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded for a new trial on the penalty issue, pursuant to the death penalty statute,&nbsp;Fla.

The court found that ch. 921.141 validly imposed the death penalty and replaced the law in effect at the time of the offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of a narcotics violation based primarily on evidence of contraband produced with a search warrant of a private dwelling issued by a municipal court. Appellant sought review contending that the search warrant was invalid because the charter of the municipality authorizing warrants to obtain evidence and facts of the violation of any laws or ordinances of the city was unconstitutional. The court affirmed, finding that appellant could not raise the constitutionality of the special act in question, because he had failed to do so in the trial court. The court further found that the error complained of did not constitute a fundamental error because there had been no deprivation of process. The court held that the offense in question exactly fit the definition in Fla. Stat. ch. 933.18() (1971), providing that warrants for the search of private dwellings could not be issued unless the law relating to narcotics and drug abuse is being violated therein. The court therefore concluded that the search thereunder and resulting conviction was proper.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, because it was not error to deny the motion to vacate where the state used prior void convictions for the purposes of impeachment at defendant's trial. The court held that state could not be faulted for asking, on cross examination, whether there was more than one prior conviction where defendant had already introduced the question of his prior convictions on direct examination as affecting his credibility. The court held that, because the impeachment testimony was limited, there was no way of knowing whether cross-examination brought an attended or uncounseled conviction to the knowledge of the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before an anti-Vietnam war rally, appellant delivered a speech that was considered profane. An officer tried to arrest him, but he resisted and punched the officer in the face. Appellant was charged and convicted with resisting an officer with violence, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 843.01. On appeal, appellant contended that the state was required to prove a lawful arrest as a necessary element in its prosecution for violation of the statute. He argued that an ordinance proscribing obscene speech was unconstitutional, and any arrest under the ordinance was unlawful. The court held that the legality of appellant's arrest for resisting an officer did not depend upon his conviction or acquittal on the charge of using obscene speech. The court determined that the officer had sufficient reason to arrest appellant, and that the arrest was lawful. Thus, the court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought a writ of certiorari to review a trial court order, affirming his conviction for violating a municipal ordinance that prohibited anyone from being present in a place where narcotics were being consumed with knowledge that drugs were being consumed. Petitioner contended that the ordinance was invalid because it violated his freedom of association and also impermissibly restrained him in the pursuit of happiness. The court denied the petition and noted that the presumption of constitutionality was applicable because there was no evidence from the trial to support petitioner's claim that the ordinance had been unconstitutionally applied. The court concluded that it was perfectly legitimate for a legislative body to enact an ordinance that had, as its goal or purpose, the prevention of visiting or being in places where narcotics are knowingly used unlawfully.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioner's request for a writ of certiorari because the ordinance under which he was convicted for knowingly being present in a place where narcotics were being used was not an invalid exercise of governmental authority.

He then moved to dismiss the appeal so that he could move forward on his federal petition for habeas corpus, alleging it was necessary to exhaust his state rights first. The court found that defendant was challenging the effectiveness of his appellate counsel by claiming counsel erred in not arguing his appeal orally as provided by statute. The court held that its rule dispensing with oral argument took precedence over the statute, which was an unconstitutional intrusion into the realm of court procedure. The court treated appellant's motion as a habeas petition, then declined to grant it, without prejudice to defendant's right voluntarily to dismiss his appeal by a motion supported either by an affidavit showing his understanding that dismissal was the end of the matter for this and all courts, or an order of a federal court granting him leave to seek habeas corpus after voluntary dismissal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Holding that the tax on intangible property was authorized under Fla. Const. art.

VII, &sect; 4, permitted laws authorizing regulations to secure a just valuation of all property for ad valorem taxation. The court enumerated several factors under ch. 193.011 considered in the valuation of appellant taxpayers' stock, including cash value. While the court noted that the assessment of intangible assets was the most difficult issue in tax law, the court listed several judicially sanctioned factors for determining the cash value of such property, and held that it was hardly an arbitrary process. The court concluded that appellants had not sustained the heavy burden of overcoming the presumption of the correctness of the assessment by a showing of the exclusion of every reasonable hypothesis of a legal assessment.</SPAN></P>

There was no question presented claiming error in the proceedings or on the merits. The sole basis upon which certiorari was sought was petitioner's contention that Fla. Stat. ch. 322.264 and Fla. Stat. ch. 322.27(5), which defined an habitual offender and provided responded authority to revoke licenses, were unconstitutional ex post facto laws. The court denied certiorari, holding that in order to arrive at the required total of 15 convictions for ch. 322.264, a violator must have not only committed a traffic violation subsequent to enactment of the statute, but must also have been convicted of the violation in order for it to be computed with those violations occurring prior to the statute's enactment.

The court held that none of the five grounds for vacating an arbitration award listed in Fla. Stat. ch. 682.13 was asserted or relied upon in the motion or in the court's order vacating the award. Likewise, the court held that none of the three grounds listed in appellee's motion and in the court's order as the basis for setting aside the award were among those provided for by chapter 682.13.

Petitioner argued that the record before the Board was not sufficient to support the decision. The appellate court found, however, that the record was sufficient to support the decision. The appellate court also declined to pass on the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. &sect; 550.164, which provided that any unclaimed funds for payment of tickets would escheat to the state after one year. The court held that this issue was not properly before the court because the Board's order made no reference to escheat and because the findings of fact of the Director of the Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering conclusively showed that the application of petitioner for a reduction of the &quot;outs&quot; ticket account was made prior to the time that any question of escheat could have arisen. Therefore, the court declined to pass upon the constitutionality of the statute and denied certiorari.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant investors instituted a class action against appellee citrus association alleging that appellants were damaged by actions taken by appellee's board of directors, which limited trading in frozen concentrated orange juice, thus depressing the price and enabling other investors to manipulate the market, all of which redounded to the detriment of appellants. Process was personally served in the state of Florida on appellee's first vice president. Appellee filed a motion to quash service of process, which the trial court granted. Affirming the trial court's judgment, the court ruled that the requirements of doing business and connexity, as delineated in Fla. Stat. ch. 48.181 (1971), must be read together with Fla. Stat. ch. 48.081 (1971). Thus, when attempting to serve a foreign corporation, not qualified to do business in the state of Florida, the requirements of business and connexity must be met, and process must be served upon a person qualified to accept service. The court held that there was no showing of connexity, therefore, service could not be sustained under the long-arm statutes.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner sought a writ of certiorari. The court stated that the statute was not invalid as an improper delegation of legislative power in that it clearly set out the standards that authorized the denial of the license. The court also stated that the statute did not deprive petitioner of property without due process of law because the power to regulate automobile dealers as a class was within the purview of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

Appellant alleged that appellee driver's negligence in driving appellee owner's truck caused decedent's death. The jury returned a verdict in favor of appellees after the trial court refused appellant's requested instruction predicated upon comparative negligence of the parties. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment in favor of appellees and remanded for a new trial, because it held that contributory negligence no longer barred recovery in an action to recover damages for another's negligence, but that the comparative negligence theory applied, whereby damages allowed would be reduced in proportion to the amount of the negligence attributable to the person bringing such action or on behalf of whom such action was maintained.</SPAN></P>

After defendant's trial and sentencing, but before his appeal, the statute defining the abominable and detestable crime against nature and classifying it a felony, Fla. Stat. ch. 800.01 (1969), was determined to be unconstitutional for vagueness and uncertainty. On appeal, the court held that defendant's trial was fundamentally unfair because the jury was instructed that it could find defendant guilty of first degree murder if it found that the murder was committed during the commission of a nonexistent crime based on an unconstitutional statute. The court thus reversed defendant's conviction and remanded for a new trial, during which it instructed that there be no reference to ch. 800.01.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner contended that Rules of Procedure of respondent failed to provide petitioner with due process protections required by the United States and Florida Constitutions in that respondent investigated, authorizing the filing of the complaint, and ultimately determined, as adjudicator, petitioner's guilt or innocence.

The state trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the federal district court had prior jurisdiction. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded with directions to reinstate the complaint, finding that nothing in the federal court order vested prior jurisdiction over the subject matter in the federal court. The court reasoned that the order merely approved defendants' plan, which provided for separate lists for black and white civil service applicants. Noting that the plan seemed to violate state law and civil service regulations, the court observed that the federal court did not rule on whether these state laws violated the United States Constitution or on whether defendants had a right by stipulation to ignore Florida law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee accused was charged with manslaughter because of his negligent operation of his automobile. The trial court dismissed the charges, pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.190(c)(4), on the ground that there was insufficient proof of the charge. The court treated appellant state's demand for review as a petition for a writ of certiorari and determined that the dismissal was a departure from the essential requirements of the law. The court pointed to proffered testimony that would show that appellee was drinking, accelerated rapidly, was not watching the road, and made no effort at avoidance. Although the trial court did not give any reasons for dismissing the case, the court addressed appellee's arguments for dismissal. The court reasoned that while appellee's drinking alone did not by itself establish culpable negligence, the proffered evidence would fully justify finding appellee culpably negligent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the dismissal of the manslaughter charge against appellee accused because the evidence proffered by appellee state was sufficient to permit conviction if believed by a jury.</SPAN></P>

Appellants, a city and luxury hotels, opposed the classification. Appellee filed for summary judgment, which was granted by the trial court on grounds that 289 4-D(4) was unconstitutional as applied. Appellant luxury hotels sought additional relief against the Department of Business Regulation, which was denied. Appellants sought review, and the court reversed and remanded the trial court's grant of summary judgment. The court held that under 289 4-D(4), the distinction between a hotel and an apartment hotel was that a hotel provided furnished rooms for transient guests, while an apartment hotel provided rooms with kitchen and housekeeping facilities for more permanent tenants. A building was classified as a hotel based on its structure and not on its use. The statute was constitutional because there was a reasonable relationship between the public welfare and the ordinance. Appellant was not estopped from enforcing the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The trial court correctly found that the weight of the evidence failed to support appellant's claims of negligence. Further, when the trial court held that the evidence supported appellee's claims of contributory negligence, it was merely presenting an alternative holding should appellee have been found guilty of negligence. Because the trier of fact concluded that appellant failed to carry the burden to show appellee was guilty of ordinary negligence, as the legal cause of the collision, appellant necessarily failed to prove wilful, wanton, and reckless misconduct on the part of appellee.</SPAN></P>

Appellants then challenged that denial, thereafter moving the court to relinquish jurisdiction to the trial court for resentencing of life sentences, which would ultimately make them eligible for parole, in lieu of the death penalty. The court denied appellants motion, holding that to grant appellants motion would circumvent the effect and operation of Fla. Stat. ch. 72.118, which provided for life sentences without parole. The court reasoned that appellants had not advanced any reason why the controlling statute should be ignored on constitutional grounds, and to grant appellants' motion would invalidate legislation that had neither been declared nor alleged to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A 1947 statute allocated the coveted middle dates to the race track producing the most revenue, and the statute was ruled unconstitutional in 1971. At that time, the sole discretion for assigning racing dates was returned to respondent, who allocated the middle dates to petitioner. Subsequently, a competitor association filed suit, resulting in the quashing of respondent's order as thwarting equality of opportunity. The following year, the dates were allocated to the competitor, prompting this petition for writ of certiorari. At issue was whether respondent abused its discretion and neglected to consider pertinent factors in assigning the racing dates. The court denied a petition for certiorari, and declined to set the racing dates for petitioner thoroughbred horse racing association and its competitor, the dates already having been assigned by respondent state racing authority. Respondent held sole discretion to assign racing dates granted it by law. There was no evidence of abuse of that discretion, especially as petitioner failed to carry its burden of clearly demonstrating that it could produce more revenue for the state than its competitor.</SPAN></P>

The basis for the judgment was plaintiff's release. The trial court held that the release was valid because defendant had not been adjudged or acknowledged to be the father of plaintiff's illegitimate child prior to the release's signing. Plaintiff appealed. The reviewing court held that differentiating between acknowledged and unacknowledged illegitimate children was unconstitutionally discriminatory as a denial of due process of law in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, members of a labor union, sought a permit they believed was required for it to dredge a lake for a planned recreational facility. A brother of appellant approached a local commissioner mentioning that getting the job done would be worth $ 1,000 to the commissioner.

Upon the commissioner's acceptance of the money, appellants were arrested. They were all later charged with and convicted of bribery. Upon review, appellants argued that the permit was not necessary for the work and, therefore, no bribery had taken place. T he court held that nature of the offense of attempted bribery was the criminal intent to undermine the proper and orderly administration of justice. Further, in affirming the convictions, the court held that the attempt to secure permission through the payment of a bribe was punishable regardless of whether permission was legally necessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order convicting appellants, members of a labor union, of bribery stating that the court was committed to the doctrine that anyone who corruptly offered to influence an official was guilty of bribery whether or not the permission requested was actually legally necessary or legally required.

Respondent attached to his motorcycle helmet an American flag which had thirteen stars and thirteen stripes, with a superimposed inverted trident on the flag.

The trial court held that the statute under which respondent was arrested prohibited a myriad of uses of the flag, and that the broad range of the statute proscribed the respectful and customary use of emblems using the flag. The trial court concluded that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to the particular flag alteration engaged in by respondent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two counts of robbery. Defendant entered a plea of not guilty and demanded trial by jury. A plea negotiation session was conducted in open court, but no agreement could be reached, and the case proceeded to trial. The jury found defendant guilty, and the court sentenced him to 100 years in prison. On appeal, defendant argued that his sentence was vindictively imposed. Defendant contended that at the plea negotiation session the judge agreed to sentence him to 50 years if he pled, and that the more severe sentence was given following the jury verdict because defendant exercised his right to demand a jury trial. The court held that the trial judge was not bound by her informal remarks during the plea negotiations. The court further concluded that the sentence imposed on defendant was within the range authorized by law. Accordingly, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed on the ground that the sentence was not vindictively imposed by the trial court and was neither excessive nor constituted a violation of defendant's basic rights to due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a petition for a writ of certiorari, petitioner kennel club challenged the order of respondent, the Florida Board of Business Regulation, that gave another club permission to hold its racing meet during the winter thoroughbred racing season at Calder Race Course. Petitioner challenged the board's decision on the basis that Fla. Stat. ch. 550.47, upon which the decision was based, was unconstitutional for violation of due process and equal protection. The court sustained the board's order and certiorari was denied. Petitioner did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the underlying pari-mutuel facilities leasing statute because it only affected a classification of pari-mutuel permittees that included horse racing permit holders but not kennel clubs, dog tracks, and dog racing permittees, who belonged to a separate and distinct classification not affected by that legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Certiorari was denied because the act relating to the leasing of pari-mutuel facilities did not affect dog racing permittees, and therefore petitioner kennel club had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of that statute and the decision of respondent board based upon that statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner had sought to have a sign placed advertising the sale of acreage. Appellee county had adopted certain regulations which required the issuance of a permit as a condition precedent to the erection of a sign. Appellant made an application for the permit to erect a sign on the land to advertise the sale of said land. Appellee notified him that such permit would not be issued because of regulations which defined subdivision included appellant's proposed operation on the land, and those regulations prohibited the issuance of permits in such subdivision until final plat approval was added. Appellant argued that the adoption of those regulations was not a valid exercise of appellee's police power. The court affirmed the lower judgment because the zoning administrator could rely on the regulations to determine whether or not the public health, safety, and welfare would be protected should a structure be erected on the subject property.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's co-actor in the same crime had pleaded guilty and received a 5-year sentence, pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.170. The court found nothing in the record to support appellant's allegation of denial of due process. As the sentence of 35 years in the state penitentiary was within the legal statutory limits, the sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment and was not subject to review by the court. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The state contended the trial court erred in striking their claim of title by dedication. The court agreed and held that it was error to strike from the complaint the allegation of ownership of the state by dedication based on four years maintenance of the property under Fla. Stat. ch. 337.31. The court also held that if the state had been permitted to, and had succeeded in making a showing of facts under the provisions of the statute, dedication of the subject property thus had been effected; the state thereby would have become entitled to judgment in the condemnation action without payment of compensation.</SPAN></P>

During the adjudicatory phase of a child delinquency proceeding in which the act charged was one which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a crime, the reasonable doubt standard should be observed and applied. The court followed a U.S. Supreme Court case which supported the reasonable doubt standard in order to insure due process. The trial court wrongly distinguished the U.S. Supreme Court case holding. There was no support for the reasonable doubt standard applying in the adjudicatory phase of the juvenile court proceeding because the juvenile had no right to transfer the case to a criminal court where the reasonable doubt standard existed. The only transfer authorization to a criminal court from a juvenile court was if such was deemed to be necessary and proper supported by a family court act.</SPAN></P>

The court consolidated the petitions and denied them. The court found no adequate basis to interfere with the administrative function of respondent agency.

The court noted that respondent properly considered the interest of the track owner, the interest of the state, the good will, the quality of dogs, and the quality of the track facilities in fixing the racing dates. The court found merit in petitioners' argument that the dates should have been selected on a fiscal year basis, but found that the question was not presented to the court sufficiently in advance of the allocation of dates and, therefore, the court did not disturb the present allocations.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that because a determination was made during the pendency of his appeal that ch. 800.01 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and given prospective application, his conviction must be overturned. State argued that because ch. 800.01 was not given retroactive effect and appellant was already convicted, the conviction should stand. The court reversed the felony conviction. The court stated that on direct review, an appellate court disposed of a case according to the law prevailing at the time of the appellate disposition. The court held that appellant's conviction was not yet final. The court held that the non-retroactive effect of ch. 800.01 applied to final judgments; because appellant's judgment was not final, his felony conviction was reversed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant defendant was convicted of an abominable and detestable crime against nature. Appellant argued that Fla. Stat. 800.01, the statute that gave rise to the charge, was unconstitutionally vague. Between trial and appeal, the Florida Supreme Court declared that ch. 800.01 was unconstitutional because it was unconstitutionally vague and was irrelevant to today's society and not understandable to the average citizen of common intelligence. The decision held that it applied only prospectively. On appeal, the court held that when procedural statutes were held unconstitutional the decision only applied to later trials, but that when an entire proceeding was substantively bottomed on an unconstitutional statute, the cause was determined on appeal as the law existed at the time of appeal, necessitating reversal. The court then held that the crime of an unnatural and lascivious act with another person, Fla. Stat. ch. 800.02, was a constitutionally clear and certain statute and a lesser included offense for ch. 800.01. The court remanded with instructions to enter a judgement of guilty under ch. 800.02.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed appellant defendant's conviction for an abominable and detestable crime against nature because the statute giving rise to the crime was declared unconstitutional prior to the appeal being heard.

Appellant filed a crossclaim against appellee county based upon an express contract of indemnity and upon the common law theory of contribution from an active tortfeasor to the passive tortfeasor. The lower court entered judgment in favor of appellees with damages awarded to appellee employee. The court affirmed the judgment because there were insufficient facts to find the Act unconstitutional, and the substance of appellant's jury charges were covered in the general charge given by the lower court. The court also affirmed the award of damages because appellant was unable to prove that the verdict was inappropriate or was rendered because of passion and sympathy and, therefore, the compensation was found not to be excessive.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 222.13 to receive the proceeds of an insurance policy, which was the only asset of the estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants' decedent died in a foreign state and appellant executrix filed a will for probate in decedent's resident county, in which will decedent left all his property to appellant executrix. The mother of decedent's alleged natural child made an application for the proceeds, and the probate court ordered that the proceeds were paid to the child. Appellant executrix and two of decedent's sisters filed an appeal. On review the court found that the evidence clearly established that decedent was the natural father of the subject child. The court held that under Fla. Stat. ch. 222.13, insurance made payable to the estate should have devolved to the spouse and children in equal shares. Because the child's mother made no claim to the proceeds as decedent's spouse, the entire proceeds should have gone to the child. The court held that the probate statute should not have been read into Fla. Stat. ch. 222.13 so as to bar a person who had been acknowledged to the child of the decedent from taking the insurance proceeds merely because decedent had not acknowledged the child in writing. The court affirmed the probate court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the probate court awarding the insurance proceeds to decedent's natural child was affirmed because there was sufficient evidence that decedent acknowledged that the child was his, although not in writing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A deputy sheriff personally served a complaint and temporary restraining order on appellant theatre manager. The order required the preservation of certain allegedly obscene motion picture films and the production of such films at a hearing. Neither appellant theatre manager nor appellant theatre owner produced the films, and both were held in contempt. Appellants sought review of contempt order alleging, among other issues, that there was no service of process on appellant theatre owner and that Fla. Stat. ch. 847.011 violated U.S. Const. amend. V, XIV. The court found that the issue of whether service of process was proper could not be presented for the first time on appeal pursuant to Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.140(h). Since appellants did not present the issue of improper service in the lower court, the court determined that appellants were precluded from raising it on appeal. The court noted that Fla. Stat. ch. 847.011 had been found to be constitutional by the state supreme court, and the court affirmed the contempt order.</SPAN></P>

After police heard a description of the incident from the manager, appellant refused to leave the doughnut shop, and was therefore arrested for disorderly conduct. During the search of his person following his arrest, the officer found a small quantity of marijuana and added possession of marijuana to the reasons for the arrest. Appellant challenged the legality of the arrest, principally upon the basis that the municipal ordinance under which he was arrested and subsequently searched was unconstitutional, and filed a motion to suppress the evidence found in the search. The trial court denied the motion to suppress the evidence, and placed appellant on probation for three years for possession of marijuana. The court affirmed, finding that no assignment of error was filed challenging the validity of the ordinance, nor was a copy of the ordinance ever put into evidence or otherwise made part of the record.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On a certified question from the lower court, the court was asked to determine the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 790.221, which made it unlawful for a person to own or have in his care, custody, possession, or control, any short-barreled rifle, short-barreled shotgun, or machine gun which was or could readily be made operable. The court held there were sufficient judicial guidelines concerning whether the statute was unconstitutionally vague, and whether the statute violated the Declaration of Rights of the Florida Constitution, Fla. Const. &sect; 8, establishing the right to bear arms, and therefore the court declined to address these issues. As to the contention that classifications were unreasonable because they covered hand guns of all sorts made from any rifle parts, the court held the statute was constitutional. The court found ch. 790.221 referred to a weapon which was in its essence an integrated, operable rifle, as the term &quot;rifle&quot; was commonly understood. Weapons which were made from individual, non-integrated rifle parts, if not otherwise rifles, were not included, unless an accumulation of such parts change the character of the original weapon to that of a &quot;rifle.&quot;</SPAN></P>

When the note was not paid when due, appellant brought suit. The trial court granted a final summary judgment in favor of appellant against appellee husband.

Ann. &sect; 708.02 provided that a wife's separate property was not liable for the debts of her husband without her consent given in writing and executed according to the law respecting conveyances by married women. The court considered whether &sect; 708.02 was preserved under Fla. Const. art. XII, &sect; 6 (1968). The court concluded that &sect; 708.02 was inconsistent with the 1968 constitution and that it therefore was not carried forward as a statute under the new constitution.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a bank and a limited partnership operating a hotel, brought suit challenging a tax assessment on improvements made to a hotel. Appellants had exhausted their administrative remedies and had received arbitration under Fla. Stat. ch. 193.071(4) (1971). The trial court rendered judgment in favor of appellees and appellants sought review. Appellees filed a counter-appeal and asserted that the trial court erred in denying their motions for summary judgment and for involuntary dismissal. Appellees contended that because appellants received an adverse decision in the arbitration proceeding, they should not have been allowed to proceed de novo in court. The court noted that a tax assessment was presumed correct. The court held that the hotel improvements were substantially complete at the time of the assessment and that appellees correctly considered them in determining the assessment for the hotel. Regarding appellee's counter-appeal, the court held that appellees failed to demonstrate that the lower court erred in refusing to apply the principle of estoppel by conduct.

Defendants challenged the decision arguing, among other things, that the obscenity statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 847.011(7), was unconstitutional. The court found no merit in any of defendants' arguments and affirmed the permanent injunction. The state supreme court previously rejected the argument that the obscenity statute was unconstitutional. Further, the court held that defendants were never denied a jury trial because they never properly requested a jury trial. In addition, it was not necessary to prove claims in an action seeking equitable relief under Fla. Stat. ch. 847.011(7) beyond and to the exclusion of every reasonable doubt but only by a preponderance of the evidence. Lastly, the court held that the permanent injunction was valid because it was not too broad, vague, and ambiguous. The permanent injunction was sufficiently specific to direct defendants as to what they were required to do under its requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the permanent injunction entered against appellants under the obscenity statute because the statute was constitutional and defendants were not denied a jury trial as they never properly requested a jury trial. Lastly, the permanent injunction was valid because it was not too broad, vague, and ambiguous because it was sufficiently specific to direct defendants as to what they were required to do under its requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant received three fewer votes than appellee incumbent in a school board election. Pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 102.161, appellant brought an action against appellees, incumbent and canvassing board, challenging absentee ballots but for which appellant would have undisputedly won the election. Appellant's standing to bring suit depended upon his status as an unsuccessful candidate. Appellee incumbent's first affirmative defense was that appellant did not qualify as a candidate because he had failed to comply with the &quot;resign to run&quot; law under Fla. Stat. ch. 99.012(2). It was not disputed that appellant had been appointed to a term on a city's substandard housing board, in an uncompensated advisory position from which appellant failed to timely resign. The trial court held that appellant was not a qualified candidate for office and had no standing to bring suit. Appellee incumbent was not estopped from asserting appellant's ineligibility because he was not trying to collaterally attack the eligibility of appellant as a candidate, but was instead merely defending against his attack. The court affirmed the decision because appellant was not an eligible candidate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order that compelled the removal of appellant advertising company's billboards on the ground that they were a nonconforming use. Appellee city amended its comprehensive zoning ordinance, which had the effect of declaring certain of appellant's advertising display billboards to be a nonconforming use. Appellant obtained a preliminary injunction but, after final hearing, a judgment was entered that dissolved the preliminary injunction and held appellee was entitled to compel removal of the billboards. Appellant argued that the amendatory ordinance could not have been the basis for removal of the previously declared nonconforming use signs and argued that the amendment only related to signs that became or were declared nonconforming uses after the date of its passage. On review the court held that the reference in the amendment to signs that might have become non-conforming as a result of any amendment to that ordinance referred to signs that were nonconforming under the comprehensive zoning ordinance, as amended, and was not limited to that one specific amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs owned a tract of unimproved bayfront property that was zoned for single family residential. Plaintiffs filed suit against defendant city to challenge the existing zoning restrictions. The trial court found in favor of plaintiffs and ordered defendant to refrain from imposing the existing zoning restrictions on the property based on its finding that the zoning was no longer a constitutional application of the zoning power. The trial court specifically found that defendant's motive in retaining single-family zoning was to procure plaintiffs' property at a lower price. Defendant appealed. The appeals court affirmed. Considering the testimony of several expert witnesses, two of whom who testified on plaintiffs' behalf that the property was unsuitable for single family units, the court ruled that the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's findings. Moreover, the court ruled that evidence that defendant consistently resisted the attempt to change the zoning classification on the property while at the same time publicly announcing its intention to acquire the property for uses beyond the present zoning supported the trial court's conclusion.</SPAN></P>

The dismissal was affirmed by the Circuit Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.

Stat. ch. 475.01(2), and which dismissed the complaint against all defendants with prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lender engaged in the business of primarily purchasing and servicing mortgages on real property. Occasionally, defendant lender obtained title to real estate through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure. Defendant employees, who worked for defendant lender, spent approximately 15 percent of their time locating buyers for the homes. Defendant employees were paid a salary and did not receive any commission. Plaintiff Florida Real Estate Commission alleged that defendant lender and defendant employees violated Fla. Stat. ch. 475.01(2). The trial court disagreed with plaintiff and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. On appeal, the court noted that Fla. Stat. ch. 475 was known as real estate license law, which had as its purpose the protection of the public by requiring real estate brokers to be qualified. The court thought that the legislature did not intend for transactions conducted by defendant lender and defendant employees to fall within Fla. Stat. ch. 475, especially in the absence of any alleged fraud or deceit. The court reasoned that no commissions were received and that the selling of real estate was an incidental operation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced pursuant to a nolo contendere plea to the offense of breaking and entering with intent to commit misdemeanor petit larceny.

The court held that there was no merit to defendant's contention regarding his plea. However, the court found that defendant was correct in claiming that his sentence was excessive where it imposed additional jail time for default of payment of costs and defendant was insolvent. Thus, the court found that the additional jail time violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and amended the sentence to strike that portion, but affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustees of a self insurers fund sought an order requiring petitioners, employer members of the self insurers fund, to pay a portion of delinquent premiums and assessments.

No proof was offered as to the correctness or validity of the underlying records; no testimony was taken; and no documents were offered or received in evidence. On appeal, the court reversed respondent's order of assessment against petitioners. The court held that, in administering the provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 440.58, respondent was statutorily required to comply with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (the Act), Fla. Stat. ch. 120, and the Act required that all proceedings be conducted in a quasi-judicial manner and that orders be based on competent and substantial evidence consisting of sworn testimony of witnesses and properly authenticated documents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent state board of architecture revoked petitioner architect's license to practice architecture. Petitioner sought a writ of certiorari, asserting that the statutes on which the revocation was grounded, Fla. Stat. ch. 467.14 and 467.15, were unconstitutionally vague and indefinite. The challenged statutes prohibited an architect from merely checking another individual's plans and stamping them with his name or seal. The court held that the statutes were valid because the words used, although general in import, contained well-known meanings that enabled a person of ordinary knowledge to understand what conduct was prohibited and what conduct was allowed. Petitioner's request for certiorari as to the revocation of his license was therefore denied. However, the court determined that respondent lacked authority to tax costs against petitioner; the portion of the order requiring petitioner to pay costs departed from the essential requirements of law and was thus quashed.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner's request was granted as to the portion of the order taxing costs against him, and that portion of the order was quashed, because respondent lacked authority to tax costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, Board of County Commissioners and landowner, sought review of a final judgment of the trial court (Florida), granting injunctive relief to appellee land developer. The trial court held that appellant landowner was prohibited from building a trailer park on a particular parcel despite fact that appellant board granted approval for such a development in a May resolution, which revoked a prior resolution disallowing the development.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Special Act, 1961 Fla. Laws ch. 2559, &sect;&sect; 2, 4, provided appellant Board of County Commissioners authorization to regulate and restrict land use for the location of trailer parks and to alter or amend such regulations at will. Appellant landowner purchased a block, on which he wanted to build a trailer park. Appellee land developer purchased the north half of the same block to construct low cost housing. Appellant board passed a resolution in September 1967, restricting trailer park development without a permit. Then, a resolution was passed in May 1969, approving a trailer park development. A trial court granted a permanent injunction, holding that the September resolution was not a zoning ordinance and taking away the approval for the trailer park development contained in the May resolution. The court reversed the permanent injunction, finding the September resolution was not a zoning ordinance governed by any municipal zoning law and that the Special Act's clear statutory provisions gave appellant board the authority to alter or amend such regulations at will. Moreover, appellant board could restrict the use in one resolution, then delete the restriction at will.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the injunction entered in favor of appellee land developer because appellant Board of County Commissioners had the authority to alter or amend local restrictions regarding the development of trailer parks at will. Therefore, conflicting resolutions passed by appellant board did not support the issuance of the injunction because the May resolution authorizing the development of trailer park properly altered prior resolution.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 847.011 that restrained appellants from selling or offering for sale obscene materials. Appellants contended that the state failed to produce affirmative evidence that supported a finding that the materials in question were obscene and that an injunction was not a proper remedy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After review of 79 of the 228 magazines entered into evidence, the trial court found that the materials were obscene, appealed to prurient interests, and had no redeeming social value. The trial court issued an injunction under Fla. Stat. ch. 847.011 against appellant store owners restraining them from disseminating obscene materials. On review sought by appellants, the court affirmed the injunction, holding that no evidence other than the materials themselves was necessary to support a finding of obscenity because the materials were hard-core pornography and were obscene as a matter of law. The court ruled that ch. 847.011 was constitutionally valid and was similar to New York's obscenity injunctive statute, which was approved as a model by the United States Supreme Court. The court also concluded that the trial court's finding that appellants' store was a nuisance and its issuance of an injunction were justified, because the 228 magazines entered into evidence were unprotected obscene materials and by appellants' admission were representative of what was being sold at appellants' store.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order issuing an injunction against appellant store owners that restrained them from disseminating obscene materials, because the materials themselves were sufficient to support a finding of obscenity and an injunction was justified because appellants' store was a nuisance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court entered judgment in favor of appellee in his action to enforce a mechanic's lien. Appellant challenged the trial court judgment, claiming that appellee's claim of lien was untimely under Fla. Stat.

Ann. &sect; 713.29 relating to attorneys' fees was unconstitutional, and that attorneys' fees were not allowed on appeal in a mechanic's lien foreclosure suit. Appellant argued that appellee's claim of lien was untimely because there was no substantial work performed within 90 days prior to its filing. The court held that the record did not support appellant's contention that the lien was untimely filed and that appellee's affidavit was given to appellant and did not fail to comply with the requirements set out in &sect; 713.06(3)(d)(1). The court found that appellant's remaining claims were also without merit. The court held that where &sect; 713.29 had been determined not to allow attorneys' fees on appeal in mechanic's lien proceedings, attorneys' fees were still allowed to the prevailing party for services in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs sought the issuance of a rule nisi, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 440.24, and reasonable attorney fees. The trial court entered a final judgment, finding that the court had jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter under ch. 440.24 and declaring that plaintiffs were entitled to recover the assessment together with attorney fees. Defendant appealed the trial court's order. The appellate court reversed and remanded the matter. The court held that plaintiffs could enforce delinquent assessments retroactively against members of self-insurers funds, but that such assessments were not &quot;payments of compensation&quot; within the meaning of chs. 440.24 or 440.34 so as to authorize an award of attorney fees.

Appellee tax assessor had granted exemptions to all leasehold interests where the lease agreement showed a business connected with aviation because the activities were directly related to commercial aviation and without which the airport could not function efficiently or successfully. On appeal, the court affirmed the exemptions. The court held that the exemptions fell within the purview of Fla. Stat. ch. 192.62. The exemptions were allowed even though the use was for private purposes incidental to the predominant public purpose.

The court disagreed and affirmed appellant's conviction because the officer was merely inquiring as to whom was in charge of the premises so the search warrant could be read and delivered to appellant. The court held that such inquiry was not an in-custody interrogation and, therefore, Miranda did not apply. Appellant also challenged his sentence because it was beyond the maximum limits proscribed by Fla. Stat. ch. 398.22(2). The court reversed the portion of the sentence that required appellant to serve an additional term of incarceration if he failed to pay a fine and court costs because he was indigent and, therefore, it was found unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent sheriff submitted his proposed budget to petitioner county commissioners for approval. When petitioner notified respondent that it had reduced the budget, respondent appealed to the state board. The state board entered an order finding that, pursuant to Fla.

Petitioners sought a writ of certiorari to review the order, claiming the statute was unconstitutional and invalid. The court held that since counties were created by the legislature, petitioners were subject to the legislative prerogatives in the conduct of their affairs. Therefore, the court reviewed the legislative history of budgeting and held that the scheme fell within the legislature's prerogative and met the constitutional requisites. However, the court held that the state board's order was without legal authority because it had interpreted Fla. Stat. ch. 30.49 as jurisdictional when the statute was merely directory. Therefore, the court granted certiorari, reversed the order, and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant and his co-defendant were tried jointly. The state placed into evidence the taped statements made by each of the parties. The jury convicted appellant, and appellant received a life sentence. Appellant challenged his conviction and sentence. Appellant had neither requested that the trial court give the jury a limiting instruction as to the jury's consideration of these statements nor objected to the trial court's failure to give such. The court, therefore, held that Fla. Stat. ch. 918.10(4) precluded appellant from challenging his conviction on this issue. The court found that appellant was expressly advised that if he could not afford an attorney and wanted an attorney, one would be appointed for him. The officer was not required to include the phrase &quot;at state expense&quot; in order to have satisfied the Miranda rule. The court further held that appellant was not denied his constitutional right of confrontation under the U.S. Const. amend. VI when an individual merely stated his name before the jury after an eyewitness identified the individual. By merely stating his name, the individual did not become a witness. Accordingly, the judgment and sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As the result of a verbal confrontation with police officers, petitioner was arrested. While petitioner did not resist at first, he began spitting and cursing a short time later. When petitioner arrived at the police station, he was charged with verbal abuse, simple assault, and use of obscene language. Subsequently, petitioner was convicted on all three counts. Petitioner appealed unsuccessfully and then sought review by way of certiorari. In his request for certiorari, petitioner argued that St. Petersburg, Fla., Ordinance &sect; 25.43.1, which in part penalized verbal abuse or the making of derogatory remarks to police officers in the performance of their duties, was unconstitutionally vague and void. Petitioner also contended that the second and third offenses sprang out of the unlawful arrest for the first and were invalid as a consequence. The court granted petitioner's request for certiorari, directed reversal of the conviction for verbal abuse with directions for discharge, and directed reversal of the other convictions with directions for a new trial because that part of Ordinance &sect; 25.43.1 which penalized verbal abuse was void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, City of Naples, sought review of judgment in an action brought by appellees for a declaratory decree clarifying whether or not Ordinance 1255 effectively closed Second Avenue in appellant city. The trial court held the ordinance effectively vacated the public lands covered in ordinance. Appellant contended the ordinance was invalid in toto. The appellate court held a municipal ordinance should be clear and definite and was invalid if it was so vague that its precise meaning could not be ascertained. If the effectiveness of ordinance was conditioned upon necessity for subsequent execution of a contract with private parties it did not provide clarity required of municipal legislation. The unconstitutionality of a portion of a statute would not necessarily condemn the entire act. When a part of a statute was declared unconstitutional the remainder of the act would be permitted to stand provided unconstitutional provisions could be separated from valid provisions, good and bad features were not so inseparable that it could be said that the legislature would have passed the one without the other, and an act complete in itself remained after invalid provisions were stricken.</SPAN></P>

Appellants retained counsel and filed a petition for a new trial that was denied by the trial judge. Appellants sought review and alleged that they were not adequately advised of the nature of the charges. The court noted that under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39.05(4), a petition was sufficient if it apprised the parents of the nature of the alleged delinquency, stating the facts which, if true, supported a finding of delinquency. However, the court noted that there was no provision for service of the petition on the child or the parents. The court held that the petition given appellants shortly before the hearing was not sufficiently specific to meet the requirements of due process of law.

Several years later he was charged with possession of a firearm in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 790.23 (1969) which prohibited such possession by any person convicted of a felony. The statute however, by its own terms, did not apply to persons convicted of a felony for antitrust violation, restraints of trade, bigamy, or other similar offense. Petitioner moved to dismiss the information. The trial court denied the motion, and petitioner sought a writ of prohibition on the grounds the language &quot;or other similar offense&quot; rendered the statute unconstitutionally vague. The court granted the petition. A statute which either forbade or required the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence had to necessarily guess at its meaning and differed as to its application violated the first essential due process of law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation sought attorney fees pursuant to its successful defense of a foreclosure action under the Mechanics' Lien Law against appellee electric corporation. The trial court denied appellant's motion. Appellant contended that as a prevailing party, it was entitled to attorney fees under Fla. Stat. ch. 713.29 (1969). The court reversed and remanded the trial court's decision, holding that the trial court erred in denying appellant's motion. The court observed that the trial judge, in denying the motion, interpreted the statute as allowing attorney fees only to a prevailing plaintiff; because appellant was defendant below, he would not qualify. The court concluded that ch. 713.29 contained no unconstitutional vestiges of its predecessor Fla. Stat. ch. 218 (1906), and interpreted &quot;prevailing party&quot; to be the party who prevailed.

P. 1.850 motion from the Circuit Court of the Fourteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Gulf County (Florida), which vacated the judgments and death sentences of defendants for first-degree murder of two attendants of a service station.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, after being assured they would get a jury trial on the issue of mercy and that the state would not use pictures of the murdered victims, pleaded guilty to indictments charging first-degree murder. The jury refused to recommend mercy. Defendants were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death for killing two filing station attendants. Thereafter, defendants' motion to vacate, on a number of grounds, was granted. On appeal, the court reversed and reinstated the death sentences. The court found that the evidence reflected that defendants knew that their guilty plea would result in either death or a life imprisonment sentence and that the pleas were made after a full assessment of the state's most damaging evidence and after they were unable to supply their attorney with any leads to establish a defense. Therefore, the trial court erred in finding that the guilty pleas reasonably may have been the result of fear. Further, the trial court erred in finding for defendants on the issue of innocence. Defendants failed to establish on collateral attack any substantial evidence that there was an insufficiency in the state's evidence so as to warrant a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment entered in the collateral proceedings was reversed as to those portions that found in favor of defendants; otherwise, the judgment was affirmed.

The court certified the question, of whether collateral attacks on judgments imposing the death penalty should be directly appealable to the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>

Appellant property owner filed a complaint as a member of an affected class and alleged that the ordinances were unconstitutional. The trial court determined that the ordinances were unconstitutional for the reason that they were discriminatory, arbitrary, and capricious. The court reversed, holding that there was no constitutional infirmity and stated that classification of properties for taxation purposes was permissible so long as such classifications were not arbitrary, unreasonable, and unjustly discriminating, and applied similarly to all under like conditions. The court held the same adequate garbage and trash service was provided to all citizens, including new residents and occupants of new commercial buildings, and the charges contained in the challenged ordinances were valid for such proprietary services.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellee county enacted a lot clearing ordinance, the county manager found that a lot owned by appellant property owner constituted a nuisance. After due notice with no action by appellant, the county manager had appellant's lot cleared and a lien placed against the property. Appellant instituted proceedings and attacked the constitutionality of the ordinance. After the trial court held that the ordinance was valid and granted summary judgment to appellee, appellant sought review and argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional as vague and indefinite because it failed to provide standards that governed the county manager's actions. The court found that appellee's ordinance had a limited definition that was readily ascertainable by the average person as to its meaning and limitations. Moreover, appellee possessed all the powers of a municipality and was vested with the power to abate nuisances under Fla. Stat. ch. 167.05. The court affirmed the summary judgment because appellee's ordinance merely directed the county manager on performance of his duties when protecting the general welfare of the public under the police power when a nuisance existed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment in favor of appellee county because appellee's ordinance regulated the use of private property so it would not be used to the detriment of the general public and directed that actions undertaken by the county manager be for the benefit of the community as a whole. Thus, the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague or indefinite as appellant property owner contended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Bay County (Florida), which convicted appellant of possessing marijuana after refusing to conduct a hearing outside the jury's presence for the purpose of determining the voluntariness of a confession obtained from appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, convicted of possessing marijuana, argued that the trial court erred in considering, in the presence of the jury, a motion to suppress his confession on the ground that it was not voluntarily given. The court agreed, noting first that appellant had deferred to trial the trial court's consideration of the motion, but that the trial court had not indicated that its consideration would be within the jury's hearing. Moreover, such a hearing in the jury's presence on the question of voluntariness did not constitute a waiver by appellant of an out-of-presence hearing, the court ruled, as a hearing so conducted was illegal under guidelines laid down by the U.S. Supreme Court. A finding that a confession was coerced could easily be disregarded by a jury believing a defendant to be guilty, the court added. Further, Fla. R. Crim. P. 1.190(i), which set forth a method for suppressing a confession, provided no basis for the voluntariness question to be heard by a jury, the court stated. Finally, the error was highly prejudicial, the court concluded, because without the confession there was no evidence linking appellant to the marijuana in the car in which four others were riding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment convicting appellant of possessing marijuana after a hearing on voluntariness of his confession was conducted in the jury's presence reversed, and new trial ordered, because jury verdict could be tainted even if question of coercion was decided in appellant's favor and because, absent the confession, there was no evidence linking appellant to the marijuana in the car in which four others were riding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, represented by a public defender after having been adjudged indigent, was convicted of aggravated assault upon his plea of guilty and sentenced to five years in prison, the maximum allowed under Fla.

Appellant challenged the latter order on appeal. The court vacated that portion of the lower court's order which provided that in default of payment of costs taxed against appellant that he be confined in a county jail for 39 days at hard labor to run consecutive with the sentence of five years because an indigent criminal defendant, such as appellant, could not constitutionally be imprisoned beyond the maximum term specified by statute because of his failure to satisfy the monetary provisions of a sentence.

The court determined that respondent had plenary power to issue the subpoenas and was immune from the requirement of showing materiality in compelling production of testimony and documentary evidence it desired. It also held that each of the petitioners was specifically described as an officer or director of the companies and one or more of them were in a position to produce the records desired. However, the court held that the subpoenas were too broad and all encompassing, and therefore they were unreasonable, oppressive, and violated the constitutional guarantees against unreasonable searches.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant electric companies sought an injunction or a writ of mandamus against appellee city either prohibiting it from taxing electricity, or compelling it to tax appellee oil company under Fla. Stat. ch. 167.431. The trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground that because the statute did not specifically mention fuel oil, taxation of it was unconstitutional under Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 16. On appeal the court reversed. Although the statute did not specifically mention fuel oil, taxation of it was constitutional because the statute authorized taxation of &quot;competitive utilities.&quot; If fuel oil was found to be a competitive utility of electricity, taxation of it would be mandatory if electricity continued to be taxed. However, because revenue bonds were outstanding and utility tax revenues were pledged for their repayment, an attack on the constitutionality of the ordinance taxing appellants may have been barred by res judicata. If appellants were so barred, a writ of mandamus would be the only relief available. The court remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

However, appellants could have been barred from attacking the taxing ordinance, but would then be entitled to a writ of mandamus compelling taxation of appellee oil company.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested under a warrant issued in the name of the city clerk, and signed by a deputy clerk. Appellant sought a writ of certiorari to review the denial of his motion to quash the warrant, contending that the issuance of a warrant by a city clerk was the exercise of a judicial function by a nonjudicial officer, and therefore a violation of the separation of powers under Fla.Const. art. II, &sect; 3, and Fla.Const. art. V, &sect; 1, which vested judicial power in the state courts. The court affirmed and held that the decision whether to issue a warrant was, at most, quasi-judicial and not within the &quot;judicial power&quot; reserved by the constitution to the judicial branch. The court held that the emphasis should not have been placed upon fine distinctions between judicial officers and non-judicial officers, but instead upon the requirement that the person who issued the warrant be neutral and disinterested, and that such person make a finding of probable cause before issuing a warrant. The city clerk was not unalterably aligned with law enforcement and therefore could have fulfilled the role of the neutral person which the constitution required to be placed between police and public.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court affirmed the convictions and appellants filed a petition for writ of certiorari to review the affirmation.

After discussing the matter with three criminal attorneys, defendant went to the assistant state attorney to discuss the matter and executed a waiver of immunity. Defendant then discussed the matter before a grand jury and was indicted. Defendant contended he was never advised that he was a suspect, that he was unfamiliar with Fla. Stat. ch. 932.29, that he was not advised that he could be compelled to testify under the immunity statute, and that he was never advised that if he were compelled to testify such evidence could not be used against him in a criminal prosecution. The court reversed and remanded the dismissal of the indictment. The lack of Miranda warnings did not immunize defendant from prosecution. Defendant was under no compulsion to make statements before the state attorney or the grand jury. The waiver was clear, specific, and unambiguous in stating that defendant waived all immunity rights. Defendant waived any immunity and volunteered the information given and was therefore not entitled to have his statements protected.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment for appellee on the ground that appellant's research method was unreliable and, thus, appellant failed to establish discriminatory assessment. The judgment required appellant to pay interest on the disputed amount of the tax. On appeal the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The trial court properly found that appellant failed to prove discrimination because its research method was based on the sale price of property, which was not necessarily equal to the property's fair market value. However, the interest assessment against appellant was error under a recent appellate opinion that set the rule for assessing interest.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 860.01. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence the results of a blood test administered pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 322.261, despite the fact that the evidence established that appellant was not placed under arrest until three months thereafter. The court affirmed and held that a blood test to determine alcoholic content could not be administered to an unconscious person not under arrest for an offense committed while the person was driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic beverages. It was clear from the testimony of all witnesses that at the time the blood sample was taken, appellant was in a state of intoxication. Therefore, there was nothing in the evidence from which a reasonable conclusion could be drawn that appellant consented to a blood sample being taken from him. The test results constituted the chief evidence against appellant to prove an essential element of the crime of which he was found guilty, and so such error was prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff beneficiaries and trustees of an estate consisting of several rental units were charged with 70 violations of a city Housing Code, Ordinance FF-415. Plaintiffs sought a declaration of their rights under FF-415 and an injunction to restrain defendant from interfering with their contractual rights with their tenants and from ordering the units to be vacated and posted unfit for human habitation. A jury found that 50 of the alleged violations did not materially jeopardize or adversely affect any tenant's health or safety and that all but one of the remaining defects had been cured prior to trial. Thereafter, the trial court declared FF-415 valid and denied the request for an injunction. Plaintiffs appealed. On appeal, the court held that FF-415, &sect;&sect; 302 and 303.4, were invalid because the requirements that each low-rental unit have a sink, convenience electrical outlets, and a supply of hot water were not needed to protect the health, safety, or welfare of the tenants.

The trial court entered summary judgment in appellee's favor. Appellants challenged that decision. On appeal, the court affirmed. The attachment of appellants' real property was valid because the debt alleged in the complaint was liquidated in character. The attachment statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 76.09, was not unconstitutional. The record did not create a genuine issue of fact on the items of damages claimed by and awarded to appellee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by information with violations of Fla. Stat. ch. 832.05(3). Each information essentially repeated the language of the entire statutory provision, varying only in differences of the dates of crimes and the payees involved. Because the statutory language included several means of commission of the offense, each stated in the disjunctive, the trial court ordered dismissal on the grounds that the informations were so vague that they failed to apprise defendant of the alleged offenses with sufficient particularity as to enable him to properly prepare a defense to the charges. On appeal by the state, the court held that, although some statutes list synonymous terms which could be stated in the disjunctive because they were alternatives, this statute listed entirely different actions in the disjunctive, any one of which could have taken place with or completely independent of the others. Fla. Stat. ch. 906.13 and Fla. R. Crim. P. 1.140(k)(5) allowed such offenses to be alleged in the disjunctive or alternative. Therefore, the court was compelled to find that the informations were proper and valid. The order of dismissal was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The court denied a writ of certiorari to petitioner because respondent's hearing complied with the requirements of due process and this administrative proceeding was not bound by the strict judicial rules. The court ruled that Fla. Stat. chs. 232.26, 232.41 (1967) supported the regulation and the disciplinary measures respondent employed against petitioner after he had been given ample opportunity to, and yet refused to, conform with the regulation. The court determined that because respondent's regulation was presumed valid until legally challenged under the Administrative Procedures Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 120.30, and declared unconstitutional, petitioner's attempts to attack it were improper. Due to the legislature having empowered respondent with the disciplinary function, the court found that it could not impose criminal procedure standards upon respondent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought reversal of a judgment from the Pinellas County Circuit Court (Florida), which convicted them, upon a jury verdict, of rape. Appellants challenged their convictions by asserting eight different grounds for reversal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged their rape convictions. All eight of their claims were rejected. The court held that quashing appellants' pretrial subpoenas to witnesses was proper because the Special Act authorizing such subpoenas was unconstitutional, and admitting a photograph of the victim with the word &quot;victim&quot; on the reverse was permissible because she testified and identified the photo. In addition, the prosecutor's actions were not so improper as to violate due process, and admission of certain physical evidence was proper. Furthermore, the fact that witness lists came piecemeal, and some names lacked addresses, was not prejudicial, and joint representation by a single public defender's office was acceptable under the circumstances. Finally, the jury instructions giving a no-adverse-inference charge and omitting lesser-included-offense charges were proper, while the fact that one appellant did not actually engage in sexual intercourse with the victim did not bar an aiding-and-abetting conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants' rape convictions were affirmed. The quashing of pretrial subpoenas was proper, the witness lists were adequate, the trial court's evidentiary rulings and jury instructions were correct, and the conviction of one appellant who aided and abetted but did not engage in sexual relations with the victim was permissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner town sought a writ of certiorari to review an order of the circuit court (Florida), which reversed the conviction of respondent defendant in the municipal court for violation of an ordinance that the circuit court found to be unconstitutional and invalid as an unreasonable exercise of petitioner's police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner town enacted an ordinance prohibiting surfboarding. Respondent defendant violated the ordinance and, upon coming ashore, was arrested after having been warned by a police officer that such activity was illegal. The town manager testified at trial that the ordinance had been adopted to protect the lives of people on the beaches. Respondent was convicted in the municipal court, but, on appeal, the circuit court reversed the conviction. Petitioner sought a writ of certiorari to review the circuit court's decision. The court granted the writ and reversed the judgment of the circuit court, holding that the testimony on the purpose for the adoption of the ordinance, coupled with the theory that a municipal ordinance was presumed to be reasonable unless its unreasonable character appeared on its face, sustained the validity of the ordinance. The court also found a rational relationship between the ordinance and the purpose it sought to accomplish.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee's grove bordered the traditional Indian River citrus area, and he marketed his fruit for 15 years as such before appellant Florida Citrus Commission in a proceeding in which appellant growers' association participated issued regulations which would prohibit appellee from continuing to use that label. Appellee brought a suit in equity asking for an injunction prohibiting the regulations from being enforced against him. The trial court granted one. Rejecting appellants' claim that appellee was first required to seek relief before the Florida Citrus Commission by Fla. Stat. ch. 601.12, the court decided the trial court had equity jurisdiction under Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 6(3). The court agreed that appellant commission's regulations pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 601 were unreasonably arbitrary because there was no reasonable basis to prohibit appellee's continuing practice of labeling his fruit Indian River.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged and convicted with buying, receiving, or concealing stolen property and petit larceny. Appellant challenged his conviction and contended the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the stolen property found subsequent to his unlawful arrest. Additionally, appellant contended that the evidence was insufficient to support the charge of buying, receiving, or concealing stolen property. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that probable cause existed supporting the officers' beliefs that appellant was guilty of vagrancy; therefore, the subsequent search following appellant's arrest was valid. Further, the court held that competent evidence existed in the record supporting appellant's conviction. The court remanded for review of appellant's petit larceny conviction, because it constituted a misdemeanor and was not within the court's province of statutory review.</SPAN></P>

Appellee filed suit for declaratory judgment with trial court entering final judgment in favor of appellees holding such request to install pumps and tanks was not considered a service station as defined in the zoning ordinance. The court also held that the ordinance was unconstitutional by making an exception for owners of certain size hotels. On appeal, the court affirmed the portion of the judgment affirming the building permit based on appellees request for pumps and tanks was not under the definition of service station. The court, however, vacated the portion of the judgment that found the ordinance unconstitutional because the trial court had no authority to make such determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was a city fireman, who was demoted by appellant city personnel board. Conceiving that his demotion had been illegally accomplished, appellee filed a petition for certiorari in the trial court to review the action of appellant. The trial court quashed the order and directed that appellee be reinstated. The Third District Court of Appeal affirmed. At the time appellant had filed his petition, he filed a motion for attorney's fees pursuant to 1951 Fla. Laws ch. 27735. The cited section provided for the assessment of attorney's fees for reinstated employees, and the trial court awarded him attorney's fees. The Third District Court of Appeal reversed. Chapter 27735, under which attorney's fees and costs had been allowed, had been declared by the appellate court to be unconstitutional. An unconstitutional statute may not be the basis for an award. The trial court in ruling on the motion for attorney's fee applied the law as it existed on the day the ruling was entered.

Appellant filed a class action seeking a refund for overcharges and seeking a declaration of rights under Fla. Stat. ch. 86. The trial court entered judgment in favor of appellees. On appeal, the court held that, although appellees could not have charged customers outside the city limits more for electricity merely because they were outside the city limits, appellees could charge more if it were justified by the difference in cost of furnishing electricity to those outside the limits. The burden of establishing unlawful discrimination rested upon appellant. Appellant failed to establish by competent evidence that the difference in rates were not justified on the basis of the cost in furnishing electricity. To the contrary, the evidence showed that the cost was indeed greater to supply the commodity to those outside the city limits. Therefore, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction. It held that evidence of an alibi was admissible, though it was less than complete proof of absolute impossibility. As appellant presented no direct evidence of an alibi, and the state presented affirmative evidence that appellant was present and participated in the crimes charged, the court held the instruction, even if erroneous, was harmless error under Fla. Stat. ch. 59.041(1967). The court further held that the instruction regarding the unexplained possession of recently stolen property was not proscribed by U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county solicitor sued defendants corporation, president, and treasurer under Fla. Stat. ch. 1967, to enjoin defendants from showing an allegedly obscene motion picture. After the trial court denied defendants' motion to dissolve a temporary restraining order, plaintiff sought review. On appeal, the court had to assume, in the absence of a record showing otherwise, that the testimony clearly demonstrated that the apprehended violation would have been committed in the absence of an immediate remedy and that the restraining order was necessary to protect the jurisdiction of the court to make a final determination. The temporary restraining order did not direct that the film be seized and taken out of the possession of defendants. The court thus affirmed the temporary restraining order because it was no broader than necessary. However, the court remanded because the restraining order provided for a hearing on an adversary basis to determine whether or not the order should continue, pending the final determination of the case. The court noted that the procedure recognized the state's power to protect its citizens, particularly the younger ones, from obscenity.</SPAN></P>

The trial court indicated that if she did not submit to such an exam, testimony she offered from her privately retained psychiatrist would be excluded. The court denied the request to quash the trial court's order, as it did not violate a constitutional right against self-incrimination. The accused could not be compelled to converse with or otherwise cooperate with the court-appointed experts. However, she was not entitled to have the privilege of presenting testimony by her own private medical examiner, while at the same time refusing to permit the court to make a similar exam.</SPAN></P>

It was within the province of the trial judge to resolve, as a matter of law, that the evidence presented could not possibly justify application of the last clear chance rationale.

Appellant alleged six grounds for voiding the judgment, including representation of both co-defendants by the same lawyer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for conspiracy to obtain and procuring fraudulent motor vehicle certificates of title and conspiracy to conceal and concealing stolen property was previously confirmed by the court. The trial court denied his motion under Fla. R. Crim. P. 1.850 to vacate the judgment and sentence. Appellant argued that it was error to allow co-defendants to be represented by the same attorney, the jury to hear testimony from two witnesses while appellant was out of the courtroom, perjured testimony to be introduced, imposition of consecutive sentences, testimony obtained through police entrapment, and trial upon direct information rather than by a grand jury. The court affirmed, holding that there was neither a request for separate counsel nor was any prejudice shown to have occurred because of the single representation. Merely because witnesses had supposedly given affidavits prior to trial which contradicted evidence relied upon for conviction did not prima facie establish that testimony to be perjured or false. Fla. Stat. ch. 921.16 allowed for consecutive sentences upon charges that had been consolidated for trial. The remaining arguments were also without merit.</SPAN></P>

The agent was later dropped as a party, and appellee medicenter and appellee contract vendor were added as parties. The trial court reversed denial of the permit, and appellants sought review. The court affirmed. Appellee medicenter's agent could appear for appellee in zoning hearings, and upon losing there, appellee was a person aggrieved who could seek review under Fla. Stat. ch. 176.16. Appellee's agent did not have standing to initiate review proceedings, but the courts allowed liberal substitution of parties when the proper ones were not before it. Though the agent was not the proper party to initiate the proceeding, he later was substituted by appellees, who were the real parties in interest. Further, the criteria for granting the permit, as found in another permitting case, were met, and the circuit court had the authority to reversed denial when the city's policies were not evenhandedly applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, husband and wife, allowed their teenaged daughter to host a party for high school students. Although petitioners served no alcohol, several guests nonetheless became intoxicated, and one of them was found later that night, lying nude in a ditch. Based on that episode, petitioners were charged with and found guilty of contributing to the delinquency of a minor in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 828.21. After the conviction was affirmed on appeal, petitioners sought a writ of certiorari to review the conviction. The court issued the requested writ, quashing the appellate court ruling, and reversing the conviction, ruling that a criminal penalty had been imposed on petitioners for activities not prohibited by Fla. Stat. ch. 828.21. The court held that petitioners did not solicit the guest's drinking or intoxication, and that the mere fact that they made their home available for their daughter's party was not so inherently improper as to support a criminal penalty for unexplained consequences suffered by an intoxicated guest after the party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When petitioner liquor business applied to respondent state beverage department for a wholesale distributor's license, respondent found that petitioner was qualified as to experience, made no finding as to financial ability, found there was conflict as to whether the issuance of the license would be to the interest of petitioner, and denied the license on the ground that there was no evidence showing it was necessary in the interest of the public. Petitioner contended that Fla. Stat. ch. 561.241, which required a finding that the issuance of the license be in the interest of the public and the licensee concerned, was an unconstitutional statute in that it did not specify the standards to be met in determining what was in the interest of the public. On appeal, the court agreed. It held that although the state had an absolute right to regulate liquor sales, respondent was given no standards to guide it in the exercise of the power delegated to it by the legislature. Petitioner's economic interest and the financial impact upon other licensees were not related to the public interest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county sought relief from summary judgment in favor of defendant utilities. The judgment determined that defendants had the exclusive right to operate a water and sewer system in land within a city's municipal limits, and that plaintiff did not. In 1960, the city granted defendants' predecessor a franchise, which was assigned to defendants in 1963. At that time, the city limits did not extend to the area in question. In 1962, plaintiff acquired a water company's assets, including two 1961 certificates of convenience and necessity for water and sewer systems that included the area in question. The certificates were cancelled shortly after plaintiff's acquisition. The subject property was incorporated into the city in 1965. The court affirmed, holding that plaintiff could not construct, own or operate a facility on the property without the city council's consent, because plaintiff did not own facilities on the property prior to incorporation, and because private water and sewer facilities were available to serve the area. The court held that plaintiff's bond contract was not impaired in that no revenues pledged to the payment of the bonds had been diverted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, holding that plaintiff county could not own facilities on property within a city's corporate limits without the consent of its city council unless the facilities were owned by plaintiff before the property was included in the corporate limits, nor could plaintiff furnish facilities to any property already being furnished with like facilities by the city without the express consent of its city council.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff real property owner filed suit against defendant, Dade County, Florida, complaining that certain of his real property had been illegally assessed, and that defendant refused to return the money paid. Plaintiff alleged that all of the taxes at issue had been voluntarily paid by the mortgagee prior to the institution of the suit, that the payment was made through clerical mistake and inadvertence, and that the payment was contrary to the instructions he had given to the mortgagee. The trial court dismissed the complaint on the grounds that plaintiff's complaint showed on its face a complete affirmative defense to plaintiff's action, and subsequently denied plaintiff's petition for rehearing and motion for leave to amend. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding that recovery of taxes voluntarily paid was precluded by law, even after a judicial determination that the subject property was not taxable, or if the tax assessment proved unconstitutional. The court concluded that none of the amendments to the complaint proffered by plaintiff would have negated defendant's affirmative defense that the taxes had been voluntarily paid prior to the action.</SPAN></P>

The City of Coral Gables, Fla. Zoning Code &sect; 9.03 prohibited buildings more than three stories high. Appellee sought a permit for a 12-story building, and appellant deferred action for the purpose of affording appellant an opportunity to provide standards, guides, and qualifications for exceptions to the ordinance. Appellant subsequently amended ordinance to prohibit buildings larger than three stories that were adjacent to residential homes. The court held that appellant had the authority to enact the ordinances when height of buildings was a proper zoning subject within the police power. The court held that it was within appellant's plenary authority to defer action of the application and that appellee failed to exhaust his administrative remedies when he filed his complaint prior to action on the application. The court found that the case was government by the amended ordinance, which was in effect at the time suit was filed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner dealer refused to pay respondent producer for tomatoes that were rotten when they reached their final destination and had to be dumped. Following a hearing on respondent producer's complaint, respondent Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture of the State of Florida ordered petitioner to pay the purchase price and he sought review by certiorari. The court rejected petitioner's unsupported argument that if the tomatoes were decayed at their destination, they must have been infected in the fields. Respondent producer showed that the tomatoes were in good condition at delivery and approved by petitioner's agent and a government inspector. The court held the evidence supported respondent commissioner's findings. Petitioner objected to letters admitted alleging that the tomato fields were rot-free. Because respondent commissioner had not relied on the letters, the court dismissed their admission as harmless error. Petitioner's constitutional attack on Fla. Stat. ch. 604.21 (1967), which provided attorney fees to respondent producer if it prevailed in a civil action, was rejected as speculative. The court denied the petition for certiorari.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the lower court judgment and found that appellant, by passing its resolution, was estopped from reducing water and sewer rates set by appellee. The court stated that appellant was empowered by its enabling legislation to exercise its police power in raising rates, if necessary, but that its own resolution barred it from lowering appellee's rates.

Next, the appeals court held that the award of punitive damages was proper under &sect; 45.11.

Appellant challenged a trial court judgment upholding the validity of the ordinance, claiming the ordinance was unreasonable and discriminatory. The court affirmed the judgment upholding the validity of the ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant railroad sought review of a rectified final judgment from a Florida trial court, which entered judgment in favor of appellee widow in her action brought under the Wrongful Death Act, Fla. Stat. chs. 768.01 and 768.02, to recover damages for the death of her husband as a result of a car-train collision at one of appellant's crossings. Appellant pled the comparative negligence statute, Fla. Stat. ch. 768.06.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee widow brought an action under the Wrongful Death Act, Fla. Stat. chs. 768.01 and 768.02, after her husband was killed when his car was struck by a train. At trial, appellant railroad pled the comparative negligence statute, Fla. Stat. ch. 768.06. Both parties requested and were granted an instruction on comparative negligence. The jury returned a verdict favorable to appellee. Shortly after appellant filed its notice of appeal, the state supreme court declared the comparative negligence statute unconstitutional. On initial appeal, the court determined that appellant's argument lacked merit because of the doctrine of invited error. Appellant dismissed its appeal, and the case was remanded. The lower court entered judgment in appellee's favor. On appeal, the decision was reversed and remanded because controlling case law required a new trial where an appeal was pending when the state supreme court declared the comparative negligence statute unconstitutional, although the constitutional issue was raised for the first time on appeal and appellant railroad requested the faulty instruction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court's decision entering judgment in favor of appellee widow in her wrongful death action against appellant railroad was reversed and remanded for new trial. The appellate court held that based upon case law precedent, a new trial was necessary for consistency even though, under the doctrine of invited error, appellant might not be entitled to the relief that it sought.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant finance company challenged judgments from the Circuit Court for Polk County (Florida), which held that appellant's transactions with appellee telephone directory company were usurious loans and ordered appellant to forfeit all principal and interest it received pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 687.07. Pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 687.11 (1965), appellant claimed that forfeiture was limited only to interest received by appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court held that transactions between appellant finance company and appellee telephone directory company were usurious loans, a judgment was entered against appellant that required it to forfeit all of the principal and interest it received from the transactions pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 687.07. During the appeal, Fla. Stat. ch. 687.11 (1965) was enacted. Ch. 687.11 limited the amount forfeited to all of the interest received. The court affirmed the judgment holding that the substance, not form of the transactions revealed that they were usurious loans. The court held that ch. 687.11 superceded any conflicting provisions of 687.07, and limited appellee's damages to the entire interest appellant received. As a penalty statute, the court determined that there was no substantive vested right to enforce a usury statute until after a judgment was entered; then, it was used to avoid an obligation. The court found that the statute in effect when the lawsuit was filed was irrelevant because there was no total finality until appellate review was exhausted. The court stated that because ch. 687.11 was in effect, it was the proper forfeiture statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment finding the subject transactions were usurious loans. The court reversed the enforcement of the usury statute in effect when appellee telephone directory company's complaint was filed, and applied the statute enacted during the appeal. The court held that the usury statute did not create a vested substantive right; rather, it was a remedy, and applied only after finality of judgment was obtained.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 550.081(3)(1947) declared unconstitutional. Defendants contended matters sought in the present proceeding were previously litigated and were now res judicata. The appellate court concluded that the test of whether a complaint would give rise to an action under Declaratory Judgments Act was whether the party seeking a declaration showed that he was in doubt as to existence of some right, and had an actual and present need for a declaration. There must be a bona fide controversy, justiciable as it flowed out of some concrete assertion of right, and adverse interests with respect to which the declaration was sought. Res judicata extended only to conditions as they existed at the time the issues in the first action were made. When other facts or conditions intervened before the second proceeding, furnishing a new basis for the claims and defenses of the parties, the former judgment did not bar the second action.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to grant appellant state and county tax collectors' motion for leave to amend their answer following the supreme court decision. The court found that the decision of the supreme court was so sweeping on the merits that permitting amendment would be to no avail.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of manslaughter. On appeal, defendant argued that there was an unlawful and systematic exclusion of African-American women on the jury panel; that such exclusion was solely because of sex; and that the provision in Fla.

He further argued that the court erred in denying him a police report containing statements from a state's witnesses that could have been used for impeachment purposes. The court affirmed. The court held that the trial judge's excusing of large numbers of African-American women as jury veniremen was not systematic exclusion because the statute gave all women the right to serve without imposing a duty to serve. The due process and equal protection clauses did not place upon state officials any constitutional duty to seek out or even encourage by affirmative action any particular class or body of citizens to become registered to vote, or thereafter for the women of that class to register for jury duty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent drunk driver was convicted by petitioner city for violating a municipal ordinance that was identical to Fla. Stat. ch. 317.201. The circuit court quashed the judgment, and petitioner sought review. The court reinstated the conviction. It noted the well-settled principle that unless prohibited by the constitution or state law, the legislature's grant to petitioner the power to proscribe and punish acts which likewise constituted crimes denounced by state statute was permissible. The court looked to Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 8, and Fla. Stat. ch. 12760, &sect; 7(x)(y) (1927), and determined that the municipal ordinance was valid. Respondent's right to an impartial jury, Fla. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11, was not violated, because the guaranty to a jury trial was not intended to be expanded, but rather the constitution merely secured that right to an impartial jury in cases where it existed before the adoption of the constitution. Because trials in municipal courts for infractions of municipal ordinances were generally conducted without juries prior to the adoption of the constitution, such trials were not within the constitutional guaranty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reinstated respondent's conviction, because neither Florida Constitution nor state laws mandated a jury trial where respondent was charged with a violation of a municipal ordinance, even though there existed an identical state statutory offense which would grant the right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee airline alleged that it complied with Fla. Stat. ch. 196.01 in paying personal property tax to the tax collector for appellant county. In addition, appellee contended that the statute entitled it to a four percent discount on all taxes tendered to the tax collector early. The trial court found that appellant was obligated to accept payment of the portion of the assessed tax, which appellee admitted to be legal and due, even though the total bill was subject to dispute. The trial court held that the appellee was entitled to a receipt for the amount tendered, less the statutory discount for early payment. On appeal, the court affirmed. It rejected appellant's claim that the discount was not owed to taxpayers, such as appellee, who had brought a legal challenge to the tax payment before it was remitted. Nothing in the statute suggested that a discount would be denied where a legal challenge was won and the tax was still remitted early. Nevertheless, in order to obviate any doubt in the matter, the court certified its decision to the Florida Supreme Court as raising a question of great public interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's determination that appellee airline was entitled to a discount for early payment of part of the personal property tax owed to appellant county, based on the statutory language pertaining to tax collection.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that when read together, Fla. Stat. ch. 317.071 and Fla. Stat. ch. 317.081 were sufficiently explicit, when measured by common understanding and practices, to convey a definite warning as to what conduct violated Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A licensee held a beverage license in one Florida county that was located outside the city limits of a certain city, prior to a purported annexation, but within an area purported to be annexed under a referendum election. After election results were certified for annexation, the licensee applied for and was granted permission to change the location of his licensed place of business to a location within the area of the city as it existed prior to the annexation, and city, state, and county licenses issued therefor. A sister appellate court then held that the annexation act was unconstitutional and invalid; thereupon, the trial court entered a peremptory writ requiring the county and city authorities to cancel and revoke the subject licenses insofar as they pertained to doing the business therein licensed within the corporate limits of the certain city. On appeal, the court found that the annexation act was so defective in substance and form. Coupled with the fact that the licensee and appellant knew or had reason to know that the validity of that act and election were under attack at the time of the relocation, the court agreed with the trial court and affirmed its order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied appellant criminal's second post-conviction motion filed pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 1 to set aside the revocation of his probation following his conviction for robbery and his sentence to a prison term of six months to three years. Appellant contended that he was unconstitutionally denied an appeal, that the only evidence at the revocation of probation hearing was legally insufficient to support the revocation order, and that he was given an unconstitutionally harsh punishment for the offense of intoxication. The court found that appellant's claim was not so complex that due process required the trial court to appoint counsel on his behalf, and he was not denied his right to an appeal under Fla. Stat. ch. 948.06(1) (1965). The same statute explicitly provided that if a probationer admitted the parole violation with which he was charged, the court might revoke his probation. The court further held that upon revocation of his probation, the trial court was permitted to impose any sentence that it might originally have imposed. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This was an appeal by defendant state board of dispensing opticians from a final declaratory decree adjudicating to be void and invalid a rule and regulation promulgated by defendant. Defendant's rule 245-1.03 imposed a limitation on the place of optical dispensing. Plaintiff non-residents had filed suit against defendant seeking a declaratory decree that the rule was illegal and unconstitutional, which relief was granted, and this appeal followed. The court held that in order to sustain an action for declaratory relief, plaintiffs needed to demonstrate that they had a judicially cognizable, bona fide, and direct interest in the result sought by the action. Plaintiffs were without sufficient legal status to require a declaratory decree of the court because they were both non-residents of the state and neither of them had a license from defendant to practice in the state.

Relator filed a motion to order the transcription of her testimony, which was given before the grand jury after she had been charged. The motion to transcribe was denied by the judge who refused to permit relator to testify in support of the motion. The trial judge did not consider that the immunity statute, Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 932.29 authorized immunity with respect to a crime with which the relator had been charged before testifying before the grand jury. The court noted that &sect; 932.29 applied even if the person claiming under it had been charged prior to testifying in the proceeding giving rise to claimed immunity. The writ of prohibition was granted because the trial court had the authority to order the transcription of relator's testimony before the jury and relator laid a sufficient predicate to require the transcription and production of her testimony.</SPAN></P>

Appellee's disallowance of rate case expenses on the ground that appellant repudiated its own records was also a departure from the essential requirements of the law. The court affirmed appellee's ruling that appellant's self-insurance program was unreasonable because it was supported by substantial evidence. The court also held that appellee correctly excluded from the rate base the installation costs of water and sewer lines that appellant had recovered from sales of the homes served by those lines.

Appellee contended that the legal working of the act indicated the court should issue an injunction upon mere proof of a violation. The trial court agreed and denied appellant's motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court reversed and found the special act in question unconstitutional because it forces a court to issue an injunction upon proof of any violation of the regulations and, thus, usurps judicial power because it required the performance of a judicial act without regard to the essential and traditional considerations of law and justice.
